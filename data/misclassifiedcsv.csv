3642,i first tried the regular raw organic meal replacement  but i felt like i was a horse eating oats out of a trough  as soon as i discovered a raw meal chocolate version  i ordered it  i thought  please taste ok enough to drink without gagging   i wanted soooo badly to like the regular one  but couldn t do it  and i eat everything  picky eating is not in my vocabulary   after the chocolate version arrived  i mixed it with just water  took a sip  and    eureka        the  horse oat  taste is still there  but dramatically reduced  you only taste it for about a second or two  again with much reduced taste  and then it goes away  the chocolate flavor takes over from there  completely replacing the  oat  taste   it leaves a nice after taste in your mouth  i no longer feel like a horse thank you garden of life  you now have a loyal consumer of this product  i will always be sure to have my kitchen stocked with this at all times i have not tried the vanilla but i may switch it up in a couple of months  i can drink this ,1,0

3640,    for several years i have been seriously studying various bottled waters  and after researching this particular one quite thoroughly i have reached a number of conclusions  which i will now reveal for free despite the fact these tests have cost me a lot of time and money over the years first  it s mostly water   in fact  it is for all practical purposes all water according to my high quality  thoroughly calibrated ph meter  which i reviewed elsewhere  the alkalinity of this particular bottle of water is much closer to 9 3 than 9 5  but that s only 2 105  lower  which i think makes no difference unless you drink dozens of gallons a day and dozens more a night  which if you do might come you down with hyponatremia this water has a particular taste both in the mouth during drinking and afterwards   unlike trying to describe exactly how a wine tastes    an insouciant trace of dried foxglove petals masked almost but not completely by overarching reminiscences of the mature essences of oak barrels and lightly smoked hedgehog droppings   you know what i mean   trying to describe how the product under review tastes is simpler water it tastes like water it tastes like water as you re drinking it after you ve finished drinking some and you wait awhile to see whether there s any degree of afterbirth  there isn t   it s exactly as though you had drunk water   which you had     it freezes at 31 875 degrees fahrenheit   it boils at 210 77 degrees  not the 212 you might have expected  because i conducted the testing at 720 feet above msl  but the point is that the boiling point of pure water at 720 feet up is 210 76 degrees     it puts out a campfire just as well as tap water  and it puts out a campfire just as well as bottled water that doesn t contain sodium bicarbonate  baking soda  which is alkaline  which raises the ph level   dipotassium phosphate  derived exclusively from meteorites   magnesium sulfate  found only in certain caves in the lesser antilles islands   and calcium chloride  essence of limestone      amazon vine essentia 9 5 ph drinking water  1 5 liter   pack of 12   when bought in that quantity  amounts to 18 liters of water  which is 4 7551 gallons if you merely type  18 liters in gallons   into google  which weighs 39 701 pounds  which is extremely close to the 39 pounds 11 ounces you would expect from pure water according to wolfram when you enter  18 liters water in pounds  it works well in a squirt gun  which i still think more people should carry around just in case at room temperature essentia works well as a rinse after you ve shampooed your hamster or your parakeet  and it works just as well after you ve shampooed your giraffe but it takes a lot more  which gets expensive compared to just using tap water through a garden hose  believe you me   for this i subtract one star      not for giraffe rinsing,1,0
3638,i bought a 2 pack of filled hoof chews for my 70lb dog and he went wild  i bought this after he went through them  and so far he seems to like these  almost  as much as the filled hooves  totally worth the price  some buyers have complained about smell  but even after waking up several times with a half chewed hoof staring me in the face  i can t say i ve had a problem  unfilled but he doesn t care ,1,0
3637,the 50 k cups i received were of a diverse variety   i did not get one item that was the same   i received about the same amount of flavored coffees as the regular coffees  the rest include 1 cider  1 hot chocolate  about 3 or so decaf coffees and 6 teas   this is a true sample pack  i did not check every single cup  but the ones i did check were not expired   the biggest problem i have from this order is trying to decide which to try first   awesome   great variety,1,0
3636,technically this should be a 5 star rated product because dogs devour it   but  it can be a huge problem if your dg is normally accustomed t more traditionl dry food   it s almost as if this is like a kid eating too much candy but in all seriousness  it s well made and dogs will like it   way too much   so be careful  otherwise you ll have a problem transitioning back to regular dry food  can be a problem if your dog normally eats dry food,1,0
3635,i m a 53 year old caucasian woman with very long color treated hair   i ve used the shampoo  conditioner  and scalp oil in this line and they seemed to work very well so i was psyched to try this product   i thought it would be like a deep conditioning cream but it was more like the consistency of desitin which unfortunately made my hair greasy   i had to wash my hair twice to remove all the residue because the balm wouldn t soak into my hair this balm has a nice scent and i m sure that if you have very thick  curly or coarse hair you might want to give this product a try   also  if you are a swimmer you might give this a try as well   back when i was a swimmer i used to coat my hair with a product similar to this  put it in a braid and then cover it with a swim cap   the product kept my color treated hair from turning into green staw on long swims   since i no longer swim  i ve been using the clear scalp nourishing balm on my elbows and heels   waste not want not  not what i expected,1,0
3643,i m not smart enough to know enough about bottled water  i m in the camp who believes that naturally filtered well water is the best   most bottled water strips the natural minerals out however  there is somethign to be said about water being too acidic   a higher ph would be the opposite  so in that regard this should make this water much better honestly i cannot tell the difference   but i can say ther was no odor   there was no bad aftertaste  but i cannot say if this is worth the price  excellent taste,1,0
3634,this is a juice with less than half the calories than most juices  mainly because of its lack of sugar   and less than a third of the sodium of regular v8  campbell soup accomplishes the latter by dropping the amount of salt added  and compensates by doubling the level of potassium  that s good  in that lower sodium and elevated potassium levels may reduce your chances of heart disease and stroke  it s not so good if your kidney function is marginal the taste is similar to regular v8  but less salty  i suspect this is the healthiest juice product out there  which isn t saying much   a somewhat healthy juice,1,0
3632,i was worried about ordering this based on all the bad reviews  but i am extremely happy with my purchase  i got 36  instead of 35 assorted k cups and absolutely no duplicates  i bought this so i could try a bunch of different kinds and i was not dissapointed  i might even order another set  love it ,1,0
3631,i had the opportunity to taste golazo prior to launch and i must say that the  mad scientists  behind the drink have listened to customer feedback and produced a great product   golazo is not like other sports or energy drinks that taste like chemicals and leave that weird residue on your tongue   there s nothing worse then leaving the pitch and then drinking something way to sweet to quench your thirst   golazo hits the spot every time  super goal   ,1,0

3625,i sent this item in lieu of flowers when my dad was hospitalized   i refuse to pay upwards of  50 for a tiny bouquet in a plastic vase  not gonna happen   he loves dried fruits and nuts  and i figured he would appreciate this a heck of a lot more than looking at a useless  wilting bouquet of flowers on a nightstand  both my mom and dad raved about it   they said it was big  and that the fruit was tasty and fresh  this was a wonderful gift and i would purchase it again  recipients were pleased with this item ,1,0
3644,when i first saw the jacket photo of this book  i was intrigued by the subtitle teaser line  it s morning somewhere    a pensive  philosophical  thought provoking line   so imagine my disappointment when the package arrived  and there was no book anywhere to be found    instead  the box was nearly full of what appeared to be sweet smelling packing flakes after also fruitlessly searching for any instruction manual for the product  i was trying to decide what to do next when my daughter came in  gave me a withering look as only a teenager can  and  indicating the picture on the front of the box  showing the packing flakes in a bowl with milk  suggested i just try eating some to my astonishment  this proved very successful   the flakes had a sweet  nutty taste rather like my grandmother s peanut brittle from when i was a kid   the peanutty taste was not really overpowering  and while they were noticeably sweet  the sweetness was also not excessive   while i like peanuts and peanut butter  peanut flavored items like peanut butter cookies are not my personal favorite   even so  i enjoyed the sweet nuttiness of this stuff enough to have another bowl or two over the next few days  with just as good results   i think anyone who particularly enjoys peanut flavored confections  peanut cookies  peanut candies  would enjoy this product even more than i did i might also mention that i only got to have a total of two or three bowls of the interesting flakes myself  because my wife and kids proceeded to devour them with great enthusiasm  declaring them yummy  it s morning somewhere  better eating than reading,1,0
3646,i bought this when i was strolling through ross and thought i d give it a try since i am trying to be calorie sugar concious   i wasn t expecting much because i have tried several different  sugar free  syrups and they all left that nasty after taste   somehow  jordan s has figured out a way to surpass my expections with this syrup  i wish i was able to buy it locally  but i will be buying these 6 packs in a few different flavors for my morning latte s  thanks jordan  best 0 cal 0 sugar syrup,1,0

3663,i expected that this would be all natural cinnamon oil  as was the clove oil purchased from the same company   the ingredients label said it contains natural   artificial cinnamon flavors   i was disappointed in the artificial flavors  but it did produce satisfactory watermelon pickles then  i found a two pack of the exact same product from the same company at walmart locally for only  2 17 versus the  2 74 for only one dram bottle and felt scrooged   i understand this is because of their  free shipping   but could have paid much less overall  i wish the description had said it contained artificial flavors   and yes  i have heard that they are identical in chemical composition and are perfectly safe   i would just prefer all natural for the price  not all natural as expected,1,0
3662,two years ago i was diagnosed with a mild peanut allergy and told to avoid all peanuts  unfortunately i happened to love peanut butter sandwiches and peanut butter cups so i was thrilled when i found this  i haven t had a peanut in two years and this stuff is incredible  i had to keep myself from eating half the jar when i first got it for the reviewers who said that this doesn t taste like peanut butter  i d say the only difference i can detect is a consistency that s slightly more chalky than what i remember peanut butter having  it also maybe has a barely  barely   smoky flavor  but since i have a life threatening tree nut allergy and almond butter isn t an option for me  i ll stick with this  home made  peanut  butter cups  here i come  i ve died and gone to heaven ,1,0
3661,half the price of starbucks peets coffee and tastes just as good i drink a ton of coffee   use a french press and always fresh grind   i m always on the lookout for a good coffee that is not expensive  starbucks  etc  are way too high priced   i ran across this coffee at costco one day  and have been buying it ever since  about 2 years  there is some variability month to month  i go through a bag a month  and one month the coffee was not as oily   and one month it was so oily it cloged my grinder   the taste has not varied too much  and i have never been dissapointed with the taste for the price   if i had the money to waste   peets major dickasons is a bit better than this coffee this coffee is cheaper at costco  but if you add local sales tax  it s roughly the same as amazon s price   i have not tried ordering this product from amazon as i buy it from costco near my house the bag this coffee comes in is very heavy clear plastic and ok for reseal  however i prefer to store it in an air tight plastic container to keep the aroma fresher longer aroma on the coffee is very good  can t beat the taste for the price ,1,0
3659,we ordered these seeds because my kids like the seedless cucumbers better than ones that have seeds  the cucumber plants didn t disappoint and grew very well  we got a lot of fruit from them and they were very tasty  so much better than buying expensive seedless cucumbers from the store every week  very good cucumbers,1,0
3658,i ve been researching going gluten free  or at the very least drastically cutting dense carbs from my diet like breads and certain pastas  no white rice or bread   and paying more attention to blood sugar inducing foods  i ve found i m happiest and healthiest when i do this  i don t want to cut things out like oatmeal  i love oatmeal  it has many great benefits  isn t going to max out your blood sugar  and improves lipid numbers  but the majority of the store brands are loaded with various so called  healthy grains  along with the oats  sugar   sugar substitutes  and ingredients that have to be googled in order to understand what they are exactly  i don t want emulsifiers  fillers  preservatives  and binders  i just want some tasty oatmeal for breakfast  this isn t bad for gluten free and i can recognize everything listed on the ingredient panel  again  the flavors are not as intense as other brands  your  taster  has to adjust when you are recent to cutting down on sodium  sugars  etc  eventually  you won t notice that the sweet in this isn t ridiculously cloyingly tart  and appreciate the subtlety of the flavors  gluten free curious,1,0

3651,i ordered a package of 6 cans previously  and that order was completed as i hoped  so when i bought this order of 12 cans  i was expecting more of the same  however  of the 12 cans  6 were dented  and 4 of them badly  it doesn t appear the seals were broken and the cans aren t swollen  etc  so the bread is fine  but based on the other reviews  anyone about to buy this product needs to be aware of the condition it might be in when you receive it as for the bread itself  it is delicious  it s very dense and fairly sweet  it goes well toasted with butter or with peanut butter  to my taste buds  anyway   this stuff isn t available in stores here in texas to my knowledge  so i m glad i can buy it on amazon  good bread  poor packaging handling,1,0

3648,this water is based on the premise that many people experience an acid alkaline imbalance   in general  the western diet is more acid producing  and there are issues that arise from a chronically acidic condition   an approach to being overly acidic is to counter the acidity with alkaline foods there is one school of thought that says alkaline water can t really change the ph of your cells because your body automatically maintains its own ph balance   but maintaining a proper ph balance is difficult if you re constantly introducing acidic foods and drinks water can be either naturally alkaline or naturally acidic   chemically pure water is one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms connected by covalent bonds   in nature  water dissolves many different substances which give it various tastes  odors and ph values   pure water has a ph between 6 81 and 7 depending on the temperature   water with a ph less than 7 is said to be acidic and water with a ph greater than 7 is basic or alkaline a ph of 9 5 puts essentia water somewhere between baking soda and milk of magnesia   so this water is not just mildly alkaline   it is quite alkaline   the taste is really quite pure   i couldn t detect any off taste or odors   the water just tasted clean and pure in my opinion  drinking a bottle or even a case of this water won t magically restore your body to an ideal ph level   but it will induce your body to potentially counter an acidic state  particularly if you tend to be overly acidic if you wanted to make your own alkaline water at home  you could do it by getting a good quality distilled water and mixing in a half teaspoon of baking soda   this will give you water in the 8 5 to 9 0 range   but i guess the benefit of drinking essentia is that it s is purified through micro filtration  uv lighting and reverse osmosis which rids it of chlorine and fluoride   they also add minerals back in and restructure the water through ionic separation   what is ionic separation   in this case it is a process that creates smaller molecular clusters which support more rapid hydration   but understand that water molecules don t organize unless there is an impurity in the water  hence my suggestion of making your own with distilled water  my verdict   if you suspect or know you are overly acidic  essentia could help make your body more alkaline  provided you are not negating the effects by continuing to consume mostly acidic items    if convenience is what you re after  this water is going to be consistent and it will have a great taste  convenient source of alkaline water,1,0
3656,the product is good as are most all of torani flavors  just didn t do what i had hoped it would   a creamer by nestle had been discontinued and i had hoped this would be a good substitute along with real cream  didn t work  but the syrup was good   good as are all torani products,1,0
3666,i had no illusions of it tasting fantastic cuz come on  we re talking about dried grass that s powdered  but what i didn t expect was it tasting like tobacco  gross  i hold my breath   drink it as fast as i can every morning  i only mix it with water since i don t want the extra calories or sugar from juice i ve been gagging this stuff down for 30 days now   i do notice the benefits  i m not on the  no carb diet  but i do try to stay away from carbs  starches   sugar   so the only thing i ve changed is adding this wheatgrass  here are the benefits  thicker hair shiny hair  i ve always had shiny hair but it seemed extra shiny  more energy skin has cleared up a bit most importantly  i ve been regular  for me  that s truly amazing since i ve been battling stomach issues for the last 12 years  not to be gross but it goes from constipation to kaka rhea    so being regular for 30 days straight is a big deal to me i can t wait to finish this stuff so i can buy the tablets instead  i can pop tablets all day long if it means i don t have to gag down the powdered form every morning  ok  so it tastes gross  but your body will love it,1,0

3580,i recommend that you use as small a portion of the tablet as possible at first  and try to contact that portion with every point on the surface of your tongue  there doesn t seem to be a lack of potency even if you use only 1 3rd or 1 4th of the tablet  but you have to remember to touch it to as much of your tongue as possible before it dissolves  worked perfectly,1,0

3576,my cats love it   it is a bit overpriced though   and i don t like the epackaging claim that it is made of rice paper   now  that sounds all so nice and eco friendly  but the truth is  it is plastic   perhaps the outer packaging is layered with rice paper for effect   this doesn t change the fact that i am stuck with plastic packaging that is not biodegradable  and possible leaching of chemicals into the product   nonetheless  i concede convenience of plastic packaging and some inevitability of its use  especially in shipping   just  let s not make a misleading claim to give off a wrong impression  a great appetizer,1,0

3573,i don t use small cans like fancy feast  so i cannot comment on those  however  i like these because they last  i bought them at a pet food store which no longer carries them  probably because they are so expensive except for a lid i bought at least 15 years ago labelled sargeant s  these are the sturdiest  the more flimsy ones always end up getting a crack in them and are not always tight for me  the 4 stars  not 5  is because they seem expensive  however  on amazon  it seems that most of the can covers are more expensive than you would want to pay  it s the s   h that is outrageous  seem pricey  i like them for 5 5  oz or large dog food cans i buy,1,0
3584,is not a phrase to be taken lightly at essentia    the folks at essentia seem to have created an excellent  potable  re vivifying potion out of plain   source independent    i e   water available anywhere  drinking water  by purification by  micro filtration  uv lighting and reverse osmosis  no chlorine or flouride  enhanced with pure minerals  restructured through ionic separation     and infused with electrolytes    calcium  magnesium and potassium   three vital supplements that  as i have found out  have helped me stave off the dreaded leg cramps it really does go down like silk  perhaps because of the added sodium bicarbonate      and in my opinion and experience  there is absolutely no taste whatsoever  of either water or the bottle now the bottle is supposed to be  bpa and phthalate free   and the label says  safe and recyclable plastic     but if that is the case  why the triangle with the number 1 under the base    shouldn t 2  4  or 5 be safer   more appropriate to use   9 5 ph balance is supposed to hydrate better    i have no familiarity with this concept  the price for the 1 5 liter bottle is right  so with continued use of this water  i will be better able to answer that question  better living through science,1,0
3621,my husband wanted to make a dish requiring chinese 5 spice powder  i looked for it at all my local grocery stores  ralph s  whole foods  trader joe s   none of them carried it   i probably could have gone to an asian grocery store   but it was extremely convenient to just buy it here on amazon and at a good price  too   apparently  it is not real chinese five spice powder if it doesn t specifically have   chinese  and  five  in the title on the label  looked for this everywhere   finally found it on amazon,1,0
3597,not sure what i was getting myself into  but i read a lot and decided on these live kefir grains  i followed the seller s instructions and in no time i was making more kefir than my family could drink  after about fifteen batches so far  i am feeling like a pro  i would definitely recommend this product  making my own kefir ,1,0
3599,i didn t know what to expect when i received this bottle of water from amazon  our tap water tastes terrible  so we always drink the generic store bought bottled water which is a cut above tap well  essentia bottled water is gorgeous   to me it tastes like what fresh water from a spring would probably taste like   it is so fresh tasting with absolutely no after taste   i don t know how they do it   the label reads purified water with electolytes  so obviously this is not spring water  but it is a superior bottled water that i would highly recommend   i ll definitely get this again   a clean  fresh  wonderful tasting water  an extraordinary water,1,0
3619,just purchased this product  for half this price at the local walmart  it melts in hand to a thin oil consistency which is great for moisturizing  it had a light coconut smell  but nothing too overpowering  i came on to amazon to see if i could get a better price for buying in bulk and was shocked to see the price almost doubled on here for the 12oz container  do yourself a favor  pay half the price and no shipping and get it local  great product  over priced,1,0
3618,this is the second time that i ve tried thai kitchen noodles and both times it was kind of gross  i really wanted to like them because they re vegetarian  but they just taste off to me  maybe i m getting really old packs or something  maybe they re just too bland for me  yes  i followed the directions and put in all the seasonings  i might try it again with barely any water in it and see if it tastes better                                              update okay  i tried the spring onion again  but this time i boiled the noodles for about 5 minutes  drained all the water  added the oil and seasonings and mixed  it actually tasted pretty good this way  there was no weird off flavor this time  i added some crushed red pepper to make it spicier  i actually enjoyed the noodles today  i would just recommend trying to eat it soon after cooking if you drain the water because the noodles will start to stick together  hope this helps  maybe it s just me ,1,0
3617,this dust kills ants  just like it said it would  it doesn t  however eliminate ants  they don t seem to take it back to their nest  it just kills the ones that come in contact with it  but  it does that very fast and efficiently  kills ants,1,0
3616,i love these but that is a ridiculous price   costco used to sell same thing for  9 95  and still had to break even at least    honest earth all natural creamy mashed potatoes net wt 5 6 lbs  2 54 kg   14 individually sealed 8 serving pouches ,1,0
3615,this is the best almond butter i ve had  and it mixes more easily than other brands i ve tried  however  when i opened the jar after it arrived  the jar was only 3 4 of the way full  the almond butter went to just past the top of the label on the jar   there was at least an inch of empty space  for the cost of this item  it should be a full jar  or the company should pack the almond butter in smaller containers  tastes good but poor packaging,1,0
3614,the puppies enjoy these and they do last longer then most chew treats  i m not sure why parts that use to get thrown away  pig ears etc   are now so expensive  these are less expensive then in the stores so with amazon s free shipping  they re worth a try  bully sticks,1,0
3609,i have been looking everywhere for these cinnamon bears and couldn t find them at any stores   these were my favorite candy as a kid and they did not dissapoint   bought five pounds and the were very fresh  cinnamon bears,1,0
3598,of all the k cups i ve sampled  donut house collection donut house decaf  k cup portion pack for keurig k cup brewers  24 count  emeril s jazzed up decaf coffee  k cup portion pack for keurig brewers 24 count  green mountain coffee decaf breakfast blend   k cup portion pack for keurig k cup brewers  24 count just to name a few   caribou coffee s decaf is by far my favorite bright  bold but not bitter flavor and light texture are hallmark characteristics of caribou coffee and this decaf k cup doesn t disappoint   i ll be so bold as to say that it s as good as  being there  in a caribou coffee shop   if you re a fan of a more starbucks y dark roast  this may not appeal to you   while the caribou coffee s k cup flavor is not nearly as wimpy as green mountain or donut house  it lacks that nearly burnt flavor that often pervades starbucks  darker roasts   if i had to guess  i would say that the primary bean in this blend is kenya   if you like kenyan coffee  this is going to be a winner for you  my favorite decaf k cup   akin to kenyan coffee,1,0
3608,a while back  i tried zevia s cola and was not too impressed   i decided to give the company another go and tried the ginger root beer   i think zevia takes some getting used to  but compared to the cola  this product was not too bad   the initial sips were strange with the flavoring more ginger than root beer   i don t typically use ice with my drinks  but i felt compelled to drink this cold  i think i could drink this as a soda substitute   the flavor isn t phenomenal but it is better than zevia s cola option and it is a good alternative to mainstream aspartame laden soda products  better than my first experience with zevia,1,0
3606,i made a peanut sauce with this and it was very good though not as smooth as with real pb  my beef with it is the lack of basic instructions on how much powder and water to use to make basic peanut butter   there are recipes other website but not specific guidance on the mix you would use if just substituting peanut butter  am i an idiot  maybe    still  if you need 2tbs of peanut butter you will use almost 4 tbs  i have only used it once so did not get good measurements because there was lots of adding more water or powder and also i usually weigh ingredients and as another reviewer pointed out the weight and volume on the label didn t match  this of course affects the calories and if you are counting them this matters to you i read reviews about price and didn t think much of it  it didn t seem that bad for a jar of pb but in a recipe that used 1 2c of pb i used at least 1 3rd of the jar so yeah  kinda pricey    it is what it is and i won t knock a star off but just keep in mind that this does not make a jar of pb which should have been obvious but then maybe i m an idiot  no basic directions,1,0
3605,greetings    i also was smitten by this wonderful tasting dressing  i talked to the produce managers in a couple of local grocery chain stores  and they are going to try and order it in  the price will probably be expensive so that shipping costs are covered  but i think i can manage that  i would suggest that anyone interested in purchasing this dressing do the same as i did  great dressing   ,1,0
3604,found it at whole foods  it doesn t taste much like coffee but it s good in a different way  and definitely has similarities  i was expecting to have to put milk and maybe sugar in it like i do with coffee  not a fan of black  sorry  but i m really liking it plain  might change it up eventually  but on its own it s very good  a unique and interesting flavor  a little burnt  i like burnt  very nice ,1,0
3603,this water does have a very slight difference in taste to  normal  water but by all means if you can get past the color  it s not bad at all i love this water and drink it all the time  have not had anything bad happen yet  i have not been sick in a long time and this water is keeping me healthy if you can t get past the color  don t purchase it  you saw it before you purchased it    why would you buy it if you didn t like the color  some people need to man up  it doesn t taste bad at all  i love it  don t listen to the negativity ,1,0
3602,i got turned on to this coffee when i was in jamaica   i decided to order a bag   it is a very high quality coffee  very very smooth and not bitter at all   like any coffee  the type of sugar and cream you use can make or break it   i don t drink it black    judge me not   with a little turbinado sugar and very little cream  it s great   however  it isn t the strongest coffee so too much cream or sugar will ruin it the price is a little steep and i probably won t be ordering again  at least not for awhile   it is good coffee  but for my money i ll get less expensive beans that are a little less high quality  delicious,1,0
3601,it tastes good for being a coffee substitute  but  after few cups i don t care using it anymore  taste is obviously not as your normal coffee  and there is absolutely no effect  since it s caffeine free  so  i don t see a point drinking this stuff  tastes okay,1,0
3600,i grew up on iced tea   unfortunately  being a yankee  it was nestea instant mix   after moving down south  i discovered what real ice tea is   over the years  making iced tea at home  i had tried the big name teas   lipton  luzianne  tetley  etc    and thought they were okay  but i could never quite make the tea strong enough no matter how long i left the teabags to steep   then i came across red rose at the grocery store one day and thought i d give it a try   wow  was i blown away at how much better it was   huge tea flavor from the same amount of teabags   that astringent tannin taste was so much more that i now think other brands must somehow either use poorer quality tea leaves or screw something up in their processing but then  wouldn t you know  my grocery store stopped carrying red rose tea  so i started ordering it online directly from the company a few years ago   i have had only one issue with one box  it had 21 instead of 22 and i just wanted to let them know for q a  purposes   no big deal  and they promptly sent me a whole new box   that s real customer service   a company that cares if you like them or not  even if the issue was such a trifle  finally  i found you can order it here at amazon  albeit by the case  but that saves on shipping costs vs  ordering thru redco foods directly  where you can order individual boxes if you want to try it out    and at  3 box it is a terrific price and value for the superior quality received so  if you would like a stronger tea flavor from your ice tea  then red rose is the brand you ve been looking for  the best for ice tea,1,0
3607,they sent only 1 96oz container not four like advertised   i thought the price was a little too good to be true  just wanted to let everyone else know   besides that  the flax seeds look great  they only send one container not four as written in description ,1,0
3571,this was the only ginger flavoring i could find that was not loaded with chemicals and other crap i do not want to eat   i have used this is my kombucha and am very impressed with the flavor   i will also use this flavoring in my asian lettuce wraps in the future to see what i think   i really did not want 3 bottles  really only wanted 1 bottle  but 3 was my only choice for this brand   very impressed with the flavor  the cleanest ginger flavoring i could find,1,0
3667,say you want to demolish a small house  an nuclear weapon will get the job as well as anything so why not use it  just because it works doesn t mean it s the best solution or the most cost effective  a nice chunk of c4 might work just fine  this stuff is c4  i ve been a consumer of lorann cinnamon oil for over 20 years and i ve never found anything as potent or as expensive for 8oz   25 was too cheap not to try  i entirely expected to be disappointed but for the chance i wasn t   25 was worth the risk  i m accustomed to paying   2 50 for 1 8oz  1dram  of lorann oil which is   20 oz  that makes this product 8 times cheaper  in my opinion the flavor is about 90  and potency is about 85  that of lorann s version  since lorann oil is powerful enough to actually cause dangerous reactions  like extremely hot chili peppers   that can actually be a good thing  i m conditioned to both well enough to consume things most people wouldn t dare try and this oil is still strong enough that i handle it carefully  the flavor is a bit more like that of  redhot  hard candies rather than overly intense cinnamon  which is the best way i can describe lorann cinnamon oil  if you re into cinnamon toothpicks or candy flavoring  i can t imagine this being anything less than sufficient and for 1 8th the cost  you have to at leave give it a shot  they have smaller quantities if you don t want to risk  25 i m not sure i ll ever spend the premium for lorann again now that i ve had this  but then again  i have the equivalent of 64 drams now and i don t think i ve used that much cinnamon oil so far in my life so it ll be a while before i have to purchase again    the only reason i didn t give it a 5 is because it s not a 100  substitute for lorann cinnamon oil  but i wish i could give a 4 5 or 4 75 stars instead of just 4 out of 5  not quite lorann quality  but for the price it s good quality ,1,0
3669,i usually drink tap water and can only compare this to that experience  i used to drink city water which was treated with chlorine which i would purify using a brita water pitcher  that allowed me to review the harsher chemical elements from the taste  this water  since it is pre filtered  lacks such chemical tastes out of the bottle  of course  but the first sip carried a salty taste reminiscent of bicarbonate of soda  this quickly dissipated and then it really didn t taste like much of anything  which is how water should be others have talked about a  silky  taste  but that is really about the mouth feel of the water  the equivalent of texture in food   if you are the sort of person who really attends to the experience of drinking water  this may be of value to you  but i think most people are drinking water for hydration  not for its taste or feel  the health benefits are something that i think one cannot measure  you can either take their word for whether or not the ph levels or electrolytes are helpful or not as it d take a long term study to really know if you re going to drink bottled water anyway  this would be a nice choice  if you are mixing water with other things and are sensitive to chemicals from other types of water purification  this may also be a good option  however  for most people  i m guessing that they d be just as happy with filtered tap water  i know that i will be  tastes a little salty at first,1,0
3745,i used this to decorate my daughter s cake  used green for grass  orange for a path  and blue for water  i made a dora the explorer cake    very earthly  but nice  it made me happy to know they were not loaded with tons of artifical ingredients   but be warned   not all india tree products are nateral   i also ordered colored sprinkes that were not natural   very disappointed  helped to make a great kids cake ,1,0
3744,  note   when i bought this item  it was sold by  lifetime kefir    that no longer appears to be the case i received about a teaspoon of live milk kefir grains with my purchase and i was not expecting very much out of them  but after a week of following the enclosed directions i had kefir   at first i only got about a cup of kefir every 24 48 hours  but the grains grew very quickly   after less than a month  i am now getting a pint or more of kefir every 24 hours and i now have several tablespoons worth of grains i was rather wary about buying this product after seeing some of the reviews  but it was well worth the money  much better than expected,1,0
3743,i bought this product because the only place i could buy unsalted nuts was at a drug store who carried stale nuts  mostly almounds   when i opened the can from superior nuts  i thought there were no almounds  but soon found that they wiped the outer layer off   this was good  because i could tell which were fresh without biting into them   while this was convenient  i would prefer that this be done before canning   i particulaly enjoyed the amount of brazil nuts that were included  if the amount of walnuts pecans were similar to the brazils this would change my rating to 6 stars  very good  but could be better ,1,0
3742,i bought and used this product and it was satisfactory in every sense except that when i went back to buy more  the copy said  ground in a frozen state to preserve the shape of the flakes   didn t go further  no seller contact was evident on the page  too unappetizing   ground in a frozen state to preserve the shape of the flakes  ,1,0
3741,these are good  but we expected them to be microwavable in the pouch  and they aren t  not the sellers fault  we didn t read the description as well as we could have  good  but not quick,1,0
3738,i saw these at the grocery store and decided to try them   i think they were two boxes of ten packets for  5 i figured i would try one box and see how i like them  the box mine came in look a little different than the box pictured here but appear to be the same product they turned out to be pretty good  the grape flavor dominates but there was bit of the cranberry flavor in the background  nice and sweet tasting  according to the box it is sweetened with a mixture of aspartame and ace k eta 10 23 12i liked it enough to buy some more  the price was reduced at the store i got them at to 2 pkgs for  3 on sale  imo a bargain  i think it tastes a lot like grape juice with just a hint of cranberry  it freezes well into something akin to a sweet grape popsicle if one uses about 12 ounces of water instead of 16 ounces  the taste is quite sweet but it does not induce carb cravings in me  tasty   low cal   low carb   what s not to like ,1,0
3737,unfortunately  my cats didn t get it   they would not even try these   but i volunteer at an animal shelter and the cats there ate them up instantly and they sniffed and looked around for more  most cats love ,1,0
3746,good coffee flavor  these are not as strong as the vanilla flavor is in the wolfgang puck french vanilla nor the senseo french vanilla  not overpowering with vanilla flavor,1,0
3735,my wife prefers a weaker coffee almost to the point of flavored water   she thought these were stronger than  light roast  should be   me   they were still ok but just not as bold as i like   however  i also do not like truck stop bold  birch bark type  coffee either  my favorite baronet is izzy s blend   just right  not really weak,1,0
3733,these two pound bags appear fresher than the 1 pound boxes i was buying at the local vons grocery store  they are clean  not moldy  no stems or twigs  this is a good product and i am getting them regularly through amazon s  subscribe abd save  feature  good product,1,0
3732,this really is good coffee  it s smooth and goes down easy which is why i m giving it five stars  however  i was looking for an organic hazelnut coffee  this isn t it and unfortunately it s difficult to tell from description and reviews  so  for the record  there is no hazelnut flavor  in my opinion  associated with this coffee  maybe that s obvious for more knowledgeable coffee drinkers  i don t know  i tried researching to make sure i was getting what i wanted  an organic hazelnut flavored coffee  anyway  i hope that this review will be helpful for someone looking for the same thing  good coffee but no hazelnut flavor,1,0
3731,i have been considering these for a while but didn t want to pay shipping charges so when i found them locally i decided to give them a try   made manhattans and froo froo frozen drinks with them at a party last night and nobody particularly raved  the syrup is very thick and rich   they are quite good but not worth the exorbitant price   i probably will not buy them again  really good but too expensive,1,0
3730,i started using these out of desperation as nothing was helping my dogs bad breath and brown teeth  i don t have the money to take him to the doggy dentist  i m on my second bag and his teeth are almost white and his breath smells so much better  his brown teeth are now almost white ,1,0
3729,the richest tasting licorice i ve ever tasted   and i m a licorice lover   these are very much like those my mom used to buy at sears back in the 50 s   and slow to dessolve on the tongue so they last and last   highly recommended for the best licorice experience i m not sure why someone said these were stale and stuck together   they sell so fast you sometimes have to wait while more are made and shipped to amazon   probably someone who dislikes everything   on a scale from 1 to 10 these are a 20   in fact these are so superior to other licorice that there is no comparison to be made   i ve tried just about all types  too   so many of the euro garbage licorice has ammonium chloride which smells and tastes weird and is bad for you   this stuff is the old fashioned pure hard licorice buttons that are no longer available anywhere else   if anyone knows where i can get this product elsewhere for less money let me know  absolutely marvelous,1,0

3734,the other reviewers are being melodramatic the taste is good   not great   slightly weird aftertaste   if you like the other celsisus drinks  i m not sure how you would find this one so much worse   expect a decent tasting drink  trading off some flavor for health  and you won t be disappointed   i ve come to like the taste much more as my taste buds have slowly recovered from years of drinking artificial sweeteners seriously not worth all the uppercase reviews  exclamation points  and comparisons to  goat piss   solid energy drink  that s also relatively healthy ,1,0
3722,my cats love them  beware they are just  treats  it is like candy to them  do not use as a food  per manufacturer  excellent treat but beware     ,1,0

3771,i used this 12 spice mix when i whipped up an improvised cashew butter sauce for a chinese dish   i started by adding a small amount of the powder  but i couldn t detect much flavor in the resulting sauce   i kept adding more and more powder until i could finally taste it   the end result was ok  but just keep in mind that you may need to use a lot of the spice mix to adequately flavor your dish  decent flavor but very  very mild,1,0

3764,saw this package advertised on sam adams website with a 30  discount and decided to give robinsons prime reserve a try instead of omaha steaks  i don t know where this cut of steak is supposed to rate as far as being a prime cut but it is really good  the other offerings on the robinson website are pricey  but judging by the quality of these steaks i m going to take the plunge  also  this package comes with 2 sam adams pint glasses  but i received the wrong glasses  one simple e mail through amazons customer service and robinson apologized for the mix up and sent me 4 glasses for the inconvenience  good product,1,0
3763,first  we like the emeril s big easy k  cups  full flavor and nice aroma  i don t like ordering  a 50 count and receiving 49  second time this has happened  they never error in favor of the customer  the coffee is just tossed in a big box loose and probably don t think anyone  will take time to count  coffee ok  amazon s counting talent not so much ,1,0
3762,these are so good   whenever i come across them in whole foods i grab at least 2 packs   i have yet to have a rancid nut in all the bags i ve ever had   there is nothing worse than an old nut     but again  i ve never had that problem with these and i d say i ve gone through about maybe 12 so far   the chocolate covered bananas are to die for too  beyond good ,1,0

3758,i purchased this at costco  at a significant savings over amazon  i ve been using 5 hour energy for a while but was put off by the cost  this is just as effective for me as the 5 hour energy and checking the labels shows that the ingredients are virtually identical  i ve tried a lot of different kirkland products over the years and can only remember being disappointed once  seems like every product they make is as good as the original at half the price  this is the same  however  you should check out the lower rated reviews  i don t understand why the same ingredients have different effects for different people but it seems like something that should be considered  works exactly as i d hoped,1,0
3757,the product is very good  it has all the qualities that the savvy consumer would be looking for  plus a good aroma  though not pungent  or  loud    if you re looking for such  in store price of tj s coconut oil is  5 99  came to amazon looking for it  glad to find it    and then wallop    floored by the amazon price  it s nearly 3 times as much at  17 95   what gives  amazon  i ll be driving the 2 hours to tjs  amazon is overpriced on this one,1,0

3668,please take the numbers in this review with a pinch of salt  and maybe a little butter  my pack came today   the directions said that a serving was 3 tablespoons  so i took one tablespoon of each of the three varieties and put them in my  very old  hot air popper and turned it on   it popped fine with only a few un popped kernels  and the number of old maids more numerous but also very small    perhaps 1 3 of the number that i get with  regular  popcorn   the popped kernels are about half the size of regular popcorn when popped  but the that s to be expected since they are about 1 2 the size when it starts out   the flavor of all three varieties is good and i could tell that there were at least two different varieties based on the taste   i could not distinguish between the three varieties visually  but i didn t do a careful inspection  i just grabbed a handful and glanced at it as i was putting it in my mouth   i used about half a tablespoon of melted  real  butter and a decent size pinch of salt   i thought the three tablespoon serving was reasonable  perhaps not as much as i usually eat by volume but probably slightly more than i usually eat in terms of number of kernels   i ll try some tomorrow popped in oil and post an edit to this review in summary  it s a touch pricy for popcorn  but the flavor is slightly different from grocery store  popcorn and i d buy it again  especially with free  prime  shipping   good popcorn even in a hot air popper,1,0
3721,i have been buying beefeater and gordon s   whichever was better priced  due to a promotional sale  i bought burnett s to try  i do not notice a difference in the 3 brands  they are all 80 proof  smooth  and lack a flavor so perfect for mixed drinks  i had never heard of this brand but a liquor distributor said that it was equal to the better known brands  equivalent to beefeater and gordon s,1,0
3719,when my rescued stray  goldie  unexpectedly presented me with four kittens a few years ago  mealtime soon went from  meow  to  yuck    all the little cats had different taste buds it seems   the household went through several brands of canned cat food flavors with some untouched plates  some barely there plates  and a couple of clean plates   the day the cats were introduced to frskies savory shreds with salmon was a day to celebrate   all the cats love it   the only reason it didn t get five stars is because i have sloshed salmon sauce on myself and the floor several times   it could be a bit thicker maybe  cats love it,1,0
3693,i like to try a lot of different coffees with my keurig and frequently buy random assortments like this one   the k cups came in a small box  just thrown in there  but they were packed fine in my opinion   they box was the right size for the 34 count option i ordered and i even got 1 extra k cup   the assortment was ok   i got commonly liked flavors  several were duplicates  and more than half the box was green mountain coffee   i also got 6 decafs which i really don t drink  but i hold on to them for guests   i generally prefer to get more of a variety of flavors and brands  but the flavors i received are ones i like  so i m not really complaining   here s the breakdown of what i got green mountain coffee 3 caramel vanilla cream2 hazelnut noisette6 french vanilla2 mocha nut fudge2 southern pecan1 wild mountain blueberry fair trade2 hazelnut  decaf 4 french vanilla  decaf gloria jean s 1 hazelnut1 butter toffee2 french vanilla supreme5 mudslidedonut house 1 chocolate glazed donut1 cinnamon roll2 kahlua fair selection of flavored coffee,1,0

3688,i don t have anything to add to the reviews already posted  but would like to point out that both sam s and costco sell the 20 ounce pouches of this for  8 99  as of september 2012    for  54 you can have 6  20 ounce pouches   more than 4 times as much product and no shipping charges  or tax in most places   great product  ridiculous price ,1,0
3687,one of the other reviewers   d deveny  says the description doesn t mention the  vanilla  flavor  perhaps it wasn t mentioned then  but it is now  september 2012   i m sorry he she rated it that low due to that one error  since these have a great taste  i sometimes give a small piece to my dogs  who go crazy for them too  the other reviewer says shipping to the uk is too much  i don t know about that  it s about  7  8 for shipping in the us  but it s disclosed  not a secret  again  i wish reviewers wouldn t ding the product  which they both admit is good  for an error in description or for shipping costs  you re supposed to be reviewing the product  which is delicious  these vanilla candies are very tasty ,1,0

3683,i have a rather large container garden outside on my lanai  anywhere from 75 100 pots and planters depending on what i ve got growing   pests  can  be a problem  especially mealybugs  i usually treat with either tons of power misting from the hose  takes care of almost all pests  do it several days in a row and it usually eliminates the problem altogether  or safer spray products  because i try to be mindful of environmental factors  plus we live right on a bay and we ve got three cats who roam the lanai and a bunch of tiny lizards and frogs that live  in  and among the plants however  every so often the pests get out of control  mealybugs     argh  and the eco friendly options don t do anything  and instead of tossing ten plants  i have to get something stronger  i like these bayer spikes because i can control the application  i like that they are buried in the soil and treat from the inside out  i also can control how much water i give the plant after the spike has been buried  so that there s no runoff  it s a very controlled pest control solution however  unless you are growing plants in pots the size of teacups  you will need multiple spikes per plant  i can usually treat about 2 3 plants per pack  which isn t really a great bargain  however  if you have an infestation on a prized plant  this might be a good option instead of dousing the plant with liquid chemicals or pouring in gradules on the surface of the soil  which will likely be run off when you water so be aware you won t get much use from one pack  and there are much safer options  but if you are looking for a controlled way to kill pests from the inside and not be applying toxic chemicals to the surface of the plant and soil and area surrounding  this is a great option  be warned  you need multiple spikes per plant,1,0
3682,i bought these beans with the idea that i would start roasting my own beans while searching for the perfect cup of coffee  both in taste and economy  i roasted one pound of beans on the stove with a whirley pop popcorn maker  from start of heat to finish this method took about 20 minutes to produce a dark dark roast  as an amateur  i m only guessing that it was good enough to be an italian roast   note  this is darker than recommended light french roast   once cooled and ground this brewed a fine cup of coffee  i am not well versed enough yet to completely characterize the roast  but i drink a lot of coffees a 5 pound bag wasn t as big as i thought it would be  but then i had forgotten about water weight  i weighed pre and post roast and found that my one pound was reduced to 11 5 ounces the beans in the bag seem fine  i haven t run into any  ugly  beans  or foreign objects  the beans themselves kind of resemble soy nuts in size and color  they have a sort of alfalfa pellet smell  which i kind of like  the only thing i was kind of disappointed with is the product labeling  i was hoping to see more information about the origin and dates harvested and packaged  there was a sticker with the number 22012  which i can only assume is the date the bag was filled i have found less expensive beans on the internet from other suppliers  but for the convenience of amazon  and free two day shipping with prime  it s a pretty good deal  through the suppliers website you can get the beans for about 7 bucks less  but then i m sure you will make that up even with slower ground shipping all in all a good deal for a fun and rewarding activity  additional note  i recommend roasting outside or in the garage  my house was filled with smoke  and it scared the dog so much she peed on the floor   first time roasting,1,0
3694,have been buying 1 bully stick at a time in pet store   product from this seller was about half price per stick by buying in a 1 pound package  about 10 sticks    ordered and found quality of product to equal that of the higher priced pet store sticks   puppy loves them   would order again  bully sticks,1,0
3681,i have spent the last 8 months trying to eliminate sugar from my diet and one of the last holdouts was the sugar in my coffee  i had not tried stevia  and just found out about coconut sugar the other day  i got a small box of stevia and this to see which i liked better  for me and for coffee  the coconut sugar was far better  the stevia had a distinct taste that wasn t unpleasant  but was a bit too noticeable for me the coconut sugar smells a bit like brown sugar  the size of granules are a bit smaller and darker than  sugar in the raw   the six pack consisted of containers that you could either use a spoon with or shake out  i had a hard time shaking it out  so i will probably just use a spoon wonderful flavor with coffee  it complements the taste and isn t too sweet  my sugar alternative winner ,1,0
3679,this is very good coffee when used in a coffee maker designed to use it   in reading these previous reviewers comments  i cannot believe that someone would give a poor review on a product based solely on their own stupidity and inability to order the correct type of coffee for their make of machine it is one thing to give a poor review if you don t like the taste  you should review the product with your honest opinion don t blame the product because it wasn t made to fit your coffee maker that is just wrong   keurig and senseo are designed to use a specific means of brewing coffee and thus require a specific type of container to hold and brew the coffee correctly for that particular machine very few pods besides senseo work in their machine  and keurig does not take pods at all without the use of and adapter which doesn t work very well either  they use k cups   if it wasn t designed to work in your coffee maker  it probably will nottaste right either   read the instructions with your coffee maker and use the product that is designated to use in the machine if you try a different brand  don t blame the manufacturer of a product that was not specifically made to use in your machine  it is not fair to the manufacturer  wolfgang puck columbian coffee pods,1,0
3678,this product was quick to grow on me   i picked up a hemp kind beforehand while at a natural food market and it left a strange aftertaste in my mouth   i tried this kind after and my first reaction was  not too bad    when i got to the end of the container i found myself disapointed and wanting more   the chocolate kind is pretty tasty      surprising,1,0
3675,i am very picky on what i feed my family and i spend the extra to stay pure rather then  artificially  flavored   so i was very disappointed when i opened my package and saw  artificially  flavored  on the package i will not order again because of this  the flavor is good and i will use it up  i am so sad that it is  artificially  flavored  the description didn t say   artificially flavored ,1,0
3674,this product shows a tin  i got a ziploc type baggie with herbs in it  if you re going to send a baggie  advertise a baggie   i gave it 4 stars because the herbs were still good but i wasn t happy with the packaging  not as advertised,1,0
3673,the vanilla and mint flavored stevita drops are my favorite  as with any stevia product  you must be careful of the dosage  add too much and it will have an aftertaste described in some of the previous reviews  if it tastes funny  try adding less next time you used to be able to buy this stuff for about  2 a bottle  why has the price shot up so much  i like the taste  but the price is ridiculous,1,0
3672,i am a picky tea person  mostly i only drink loose leaf tea  and find the idea of bagged tea unappealing   as my dad used to say its the stuff that fell on the floor in the factory   however  before i goto bed  i don t want to deal with all the steps involved  so i decided to give this a try  i was very surprised  its a full flavored tea that i don t think could be any smoother   this is my second case  and i hope amazon continues to carry it into the future  he likes it,1,0

3680,this brand does not fall apart in your mouth like another brand of xylitol gum does i don t want aspartame in my gum  aspartame can mess with your brain and cause depression and more  it was not supposed to be approved but there were shenanigans at the fda and conflict of interests that got aspartame on the market spry only has xylitol which is good for your teeth  good sugarless gum,1,0
3720,it took a lot of trial and error but this bbq sauce is the one  i searched high and low for bbq sauce without sugar but with great taste not only does this sauce deliver super taste but there is the surprise kick of heat at the finish  bought two bottles and gave one to a friend then after i finished mine in record time i was sorry i had given it away  finally     ,1,0

3718,the product is amazing   it s the consistency of creamy peanut butter  but it tastes like cookies   other reviewers rave about it  and i agree with them   it basically tastes heavenly on anything or even by itself the bad   the seller packaged both jars together with no protection between them  which caused one of the jars to break   fortunately  the other jar is fine  but essentially  i got one jar for the price of two   i could get a refund if i return everything  but i don t want to return the undamaged jar  because the product is so good  great product but beware of poor packaging ,1,0
3716,we have a female bull terrier mix  about 45 pounds  and she really likes the nylabone chew toys   she gets going on them  and just keeps grinding away with her back teeth   after one month  this toy is hardly different from when new  i expect this to be around for 6 months or more   it is almost too long for her as she tries to prop it vertically with her front paws to chew on the top   that also shows you how much she enjoys it  cause it doesn t slow her down   good product  will buy more  tough toy,1,0
3715,i used to think that all water tasted the same  as in it was all tasteless  then i went through a pregnancy where i had a very highly sensitive sense of taste and the taste of tap water made me sick  it was embarrassing and i felt stupid lugging bottled water everywhere but only room temperature bottled water was tolerable  i wish i d known about essentia at the time because it is the only bottled water i ever tried that i literally could not taste  it s absolutely weird i first discovered essentia through my extended family  mom  grandmother  and aunts  who were all trying to improve their health through the alkaline  diet   they tried to convert me to it but talk about an expensive lifestyle change  it wasn t for me but the only water they d drink was essentia which got complicated when i had them all for a visit and had to go to a specialty store for it  having now given it a try i can see why they preferred it but unless i were going to go alkaline  or experience another pregnancy with the crazy highly sensitive tastebuds  i don t think i would be that concerned with choosing essentia over another  less costly  bottled water option  great for those on an alkalinian diet,1,0
3714,this water tastes good  although not any better than dasani or some of the others out there   it is an alkaline water and has added minerals  but i did not notice any benefits  taste wise or health wise  from that   perhaps if i drank it long term  i would   dasani also has added minerals  and i do notice a difference with that  so i think i ll stick with dasani  tastes like water,1,0

3712,i can t tell you how many times i have switched my 8 week old son s formula   we have tried enfamil newborn  ar  and gentlease  we have tried baby s only soy  dairy and similac alimentum   every single one caused my baby some kind of problem  from spitting up to  constipation  gas  and pain while eating   at 5 weeks he was diagnosed with silent reflux and put on rantidine three times a day   i did not want to give him prescription drugs at 5 weeks old  but i thought i would try it   he was in so much pain  it was awful to watch   it was also affecting his sleep because he could not lie flat without having pain to make a long story short  the rantidine did nothing to help his reflux   after two weeks i decided to call it quits   my pediatrician gave me samples of alimentum because we suspected a milk protein allergy   the allimentum did no good and gave him diarrhea   i switched back to gentlease  even though it produced horrible green swamp poops and did not really help anything either   i almost gave up looking for a good formula  assuming that they were all horrible we tried everything i could find   first we bought a probiotic and started that once a day   it seemed to help aid digestion but did nothing to ease his pain   then we switched from avent to dr  brown s bottles  which cut down on the gas and helped a little bit more   finally  i decided to give this formula a try   i was in the middle of a feeding of gentlease  and he was crying in pain   just for kicks i popped open a can of the baby s only lactorelief and bam   no pain   he literally stopped crying right in the middle of the feed  gulped down 4 ounces  and crashed i did not realize until visiting the naturesone website that they do compare this formula to enfamil gentlease and similac sensitive   it s the only sensitive organic formula on the market   the ingredients are similar to that of the other brands but it does not contain corn or hexane derived dha ara   it smells and tastes a ton better i don t think my son is lactose intolerant   or maybe he is   there are also theories out there that some babies are sensitive to corn or dha   whatever the problem  i don t care   after two days of eating this formula  the only time we are experiencing any discomfort is when he has to burp   even that seems very minimal and the burps are easier to coax out   i always wondered how long i should wait to see results from a new formula   a day   a week   a month   in this case  i have seen improvement from the very first feed   i won t say it s perfect yet  but he may have inflammation from the previous formula   i will update i know how frustrating it can be to figure out what the problem is if your baby is having reflux issues   it s trial by fire until you nail something down   if you are feeding enfamil gentlease or similac sensitive and would prefer an organic alternative  this is for you   please do not let these people who insist that the arsenic will hurt your baby scare you   do some research on hexane and dha and decide which is worse  potential small amounts of arsenic  which is naturally occurring from volcanic activities in the areas of the world where rice is grown  or the hexane derivation process   this is the only formula on the market which does not contain dha ara yes  it s expensive   but so are alimentum and nutramigen  and if your baby needs it  it s worth its weight in gold   i m so glad it s working for us  and i could not be happier with it update 9 14 12still working great   after two weeks  it s almost like my son never had reflux at all   we still get the occasional feed where he has an episode  but i think that might be stomach related and since he can t tell me  i ll never know   it seems to help to burp thoroughly when he gets that way update 10 3 12over a month later we are still loving this formula   i had an extra can of the dairy formula lying around and wanted to use it up   it instantly gave my son horrible gas and an upset stomach   i think he really does have a lactose sensitivity   i m so glad nature s one makes this organic lactose free formula   my son is growing and thriving on it  with no reflux issues to speak of  finally ,1,0

3440,i tried out steaz on the recommendation of a friend after a recent doctor visit  i had been drinking too much soda  and i m past the point of not paying attention to things like that  i was looking for a healthier alternative  something that had more flavor than water but wouldn t be burying my system in sugar  the half and half was a combo i guessed i d like  since i like the arizona arnold palmer drink  i m happy to report these are pretty tasty  the flavoring is on the light side  but for me it s a good compromise that gets me off the soda sugar but avoids the monotony of only drinking water during the day  freed me from soda,1,0

3434,i believe the world is divided into two groups  those that eat black licorice and those that don t   i belong to the first group  which i also find to be superior    just kidding  kind of  i m always looking for black licorice and cannot get enough of it   i find licorice from europe to be superior to that found in the states   gustaf s licorice is made in the uk  specifically where  i don t know   it comes in a huge and heavy 5 lb bag   it contains a long list of ingredients  including beef gelatine  okay  that s gross   it also has desiccated coconut  whatever that is the licorice is not shiny like in the picture  but dull  like a tractor tire   it smells good and has a nice pungent taste to it    the beef gelatin perhaps   it s all stuck together but comes apart easily   it s a bit soft for my liking  but hopefully it will harden up over time   despite the disgusting addition of beef gelatin to my licorice  i know gelatin is from hooves  but do you have to remind me   i will eat this licorice   i have uploaded a picture to show everyone how this mass of licorice really looks  just so you don t stock up for parties will i order it again   probably not   i want a company to lie to me about where gelatin comes from   gustaf is just too honest for his own good  good hardcore licorice ,1,0
3442,amazon s vine program regularly offers me this type of vaguely healthy  vaguely sugary snacks   sometimes i accept   usually  i am disappointed   these things  though  are actually pretty good   they are described as dark chocolate  nuts  and sea salt   that s pretty much what you taste   the strongest flavor components are the nuts  which are very lightly salted with sea salt   so  you taste the nuts  not the salt   on top of that  they use dark chocolate  but in relatively small quantities so that the nuts remain the primary flavor component   the fact that they use dark chocolate keeps the bars from being too sweet  and the light amount of sea salt is just enough for the nuts without overpowering anything   i hate healthy snacks that try to mimic candy bars   such attempts generally use poor quality chocolate in large quantities  and usually wind up with about as many calories per gram as normal candy bars anyway   these bars  though  just taste like what they are   if you want a snickers bar with fewer calories  you are out of luck   however  if you like nuts that are very lightly salted  dark chocolate  and don t want something as sweet as a candy bar  these are actually pretty good  not too sweet  not too salty,1,0
3433,i liked the idea of no sugar added   libby is a brand i have never found fault with  so therefore price was a deciding factor  libby s naturals whole kernel sweet corn,1,0
3431,this is another crystal light goody  it s just surprising  it has no berry coloring  in mixing it  i usually added another juice with a berry color  the taste and appearance didn t match  even though  it is a good tasting drink  i ll purchase this one again  it s an amazon verified purchase too  summer thirst,1,0
3430,i had been giving my bichon 2 kinds of antibiotics twice daily for three weeks and she just got worse  i read about this somewhere and gave it to her twice a day for two weeks  she s cured  before this she was lethargic and had bloody urine  now she s a ball of energy again  i cannot figure it out  i m just so happy for her  it has a tiny scoop inside and i gave her one scoop in some milk 2x daily  she liked it   when she got well she didn t want it anymore  cured bad uti in female bichon,1,0

3427,i m a big gum chewer but i don t really like the taste of mint  so that limits about 75  of the options out there for me   i mostly chew fruit flavored gum and have recently enjoyed the other gums in the  dessert delights  series  with orange cream pop becoming my go to choice lately   i was excited to see this new flavor introduced since i love the taste of actual root beer floats   i bought a single pack to try it out  and was really impressed   in my opinion it tastes just like a root beer float  or as much as a stick of gum could  and now i chew it exclusively   i m on amazon today to buy a 10 pack pack  if that says anything about my satisfaction   i will admit that it doesn t last too long  maybe 5 minutes or so before the flavor starts waning and in 20 minutes you re chewing on flavorless rubber   however  in my experience most non mint flavored gums don t last much longer than that anyway  pretty dang good ,1,0

3425,i absolutely love this tea  i had bought the pack and it sat for a month before i even thought about trying it  i am not a tea drinker and thought this would taste terrible and do nothing for me  then when my cycle started and was having really bad cramps i gave in and made a cup  it tastes wonderful and actually helped me relax and ease a lot of the pain  i had my doubts about a cup of water with dried herbs sitting in it being able to do anything for me but it really does help to ease the pain and help your body relax  i now find my self having a cup every night  i would definitely recommend for any women  wounderful tea,1,0
3424,received my order today and within minutes had a can open   for years we have only eaten brunswick kippers but am having trouble finding them in area stores   the last two cans we bought were different from what we always ate   watery  less flavor and odd pieces of fish   i am especially impressed that polar kipper only has three ingredients  all of which we can pronounce and are familiar with   we will be going on a subscription   the can we opened did not even make it to a cracker   less smoky but the fish was cut into filets rather than mashed pieces and though salt was the only seasoning  it was not overwhelming   jewish holidays are coming in september  mw polar kipper snacks are going to make a grateful gift to my neighbor  switching kipper snacks after many years,1,0

3423,i got my pods in a plain old box with the coffee just thrown in  some of the pods were damaged   since the coffee selection was good as was the value  i m going to order again after reading other reviews that they upgraded the packaging   i couldn t believe a business would package like this  great coffee selection  awful packaging,1,0
3443,i a saw this reviewed on dr  oz s program where he pointed the health benefits for using this oil   i tried it and was exceedingly pleased with it   when you use it for frying it does not have an oily taste and is not drenched with oil like other oils   has a neutral taste  i recommend everybody to try it and make their own judgement  i am sure that they will not be disappointed  california rice bran oil,1,0
3445,in all honesty i was not sure how to cook it or what to do with it  it has some  earthy  flavor to it  something between seaweed and yerba mate  it is about 60  less than quinoa so popping it like a pop corn did not work  cooking it was rather easy  but direction recommends way too much water to use  you might end up with some sort of gravy bottom line  it is interesting alternative to quinoa that mixes well with milk or can be eaten as oatmeal substitute for breakfast  it has specific flavor that might take some time to get use to  buying pack of 4 might be a stretch if you did not like it or did not find good application  seems like a good grain to add variety with,1,0
3466,i had to build up to it   didn t happen over night  i look back to all the chocolate i ve eaten in the past sigh   i read labels now    i don t do soy or corn syrup  i started with 70    85  going back and forth i got to 90         then i got to 100     one can eat with eg  raisins  ginger  candied  i love trader joe s   doesn t have lots of sugar dripping around  i need to take care not to eat so much of it even though has fiber   antioxidants i have to watch my  k  cus i m on blood thinners   i could easily eat the whole bar in one day  read the info  i live by the rule one package or anything was a serving  000 i do one or two squares before 1 or 2 pm  remember chocolate also has caffeine   my mom told me to not do caffeine after 3 pm so it would be easier to sleep  enjoy d it s the only chocolate i eat now  ,1,0
3465,don t be fooled by other brands that claim to be bacon  especially  reduced fat bacon     when you read the ingredients  you ll find those products are usually dehydrated ham chips   this product is 100  real bacon  which means you can use it almost anywhere real strips of bacon can be used  without all the extra cooking  grease  and mess   in addition to salads  i use oscar mayer bacon bits on sandwiches like turkey bacon swiss and grilled cheese   or it s a quick way to have that bacon cheeseburger   and of course  it s an easy addition to baked or fresh mashed potatoes along with some shredded cheddar i ve uploaded a picture of the current packaging  since it has changed from amazon s main image when you want your bacon bits to be made from actual bacon  don t look elsewhere   get oscar mayer and know you ve purchased the real thing  bacon  not dried ham,1,0
3464,my eyesight has been deteriorating with age  67 now  and it has been very difficult to see closeup without reading glasses   i have glasses for driving but they are a nuisance and always dirty   one day i read a column by susie the pharmacist who was recommending saffron pills to somebody and i thought they might help me  out of desperation    my eyesight has improved  especially for reading  and i no longer use glasses while driving   really   over all  my mental outlook seems to be better and things don t look as bleak   it didn t happen overnight but took about 6 months of taking 3 pills daily  with meals    i don t take anything else except a low dose aspirin   i gave up the saffron recently to save money  and within 2 weeks i was having to squint  again  while reading   that convinced me to restart the pills and in a few days my good vision and improved outlook had returned   no  this isn t a joke   i am now a saffron user for life   yea   almost a little miracle pill ,1,0
3461,tonight i had a light lettuce based salad for dinner and  to go with it  i opened up an 18 6 ounce can of campbell s chunky chicken noodle soup  healthy request variety   i thought it to be a rather bland tasting chicken noodle  soup  but that s because most chicken soups have such a high sodium content  this one is relatively low and  in fact  the potassium content is higher than the sodium content  which is almost unheard of in campbell s soups  it s fairly low in calories also so a whole can  two servings  only amounted to 220 calories  also  the fat content is low and the protein content is fairly high  i m surprised they don t label this a  diet soup   both the spiral noodles and the vegetables  carrots and celery  are fairly large and  chunky  and all seem bland and overcooked  i would not regard this soup as a particularly good one  but if you want to open a can of soup for a meal  the mix of nutrients is superior to most gary peterson somewhat bland  but a superior nutrient mix ,1,0
3460,crystal light flavors are almost all awful  but this one tastes ok  i don t notice the aftertaste most others mention  very much it does have a number of ingredients that are bad for you  there s a failing grade for a typical crystal light product on another site because of these dubious chems   foodfacts dot com  and be warned about this chem drink  if you fill one dixie cup with water  and another dixie cup with crystal light mojito drink  and leave them for 24 hours  the water will be contained in the morning  but the crystal light will have begun to eat through the glue of the same cup  and begun leaking  and    when that stain dries  it leaves a green flaky residue  not very cool or appetizing  it s tasty  but,1,0

3444,this roast of lavazza beans is a wonderful tasting medium  which appeals to a wide variety of people  bold flavor  but not bitter or burnt tasting  for those who like their beans especially oily  these are not  so you may not enjoy this as much as others that are  lavazza isn t kidding with they call this their super crema espresso  there is a good amount on top of every shot pulled using these beans  the bag i received was very fresh  so i had no problem with a earlier expiration date  that a few others had mentioned  these are a great choice if you re going to be serving several people  and are interested in something that would appeal to everyone  they aren t kidding when they call it  super crema ,1,0
3457,i eat alot of spicy food  and i had a small taste of this straight and it is pretty hot   it has a very distinct aroma and taste  it is a very tasty sauce  but so hot  i mixed between a quarter and a half of the bottle into a 1 litre much milder chili sauce  and it is still pretty hot with a long lasting effect  this is not wasabi and you can probably feel it for 15 minutes i do not think many people eat this straight  you do not need much if you want to spice a casserole  do not get this on your fingers  you might forget and touch your face with some particles on your hands   ouch i wanted a really really really hot sauce and this is it  hot ,1,0

3450,i drank a 1 5 liter bottle   i was thirsty   before i did  i let my son and hubby tried it   hubby liked it  son said yuck   i think it s good   it tastes ok  goes down really smooth   i happened to read the bottle as i was finishing it off and noticed it had magnesium sulfate in it   it s no doubt trace amounts but i thought  oh no  i just drank a laxative   i think i gave myself the placebo effect   surely that s all it was   i worked as a nurse for years and i see mag sulfate  i think clean em out   so i think i jinxed myself i do have acid reflux   it did not help   at all i actually just prefer my filtered city water   regular water has a harder edge but i guess i m used to it and i like it but it s ok water   it is silky and smooth   might be a real winner for runners and those who work outside or in hot environments where you sweat a lot since it replaces electrolytes   also might work for people trying to increase their water intake that don t much care for water i d try it if you need a no calorie electrolyte replacement   you ll either like it or you won t   i m not sure how to tell without trying it  it taste like water but it has a different  texture  almost  a bit   it s weird like that  mag sulfate in it,1,0
3449,when i first received the product  it looked like i bought the wrong thing   i was looking for k cup which come in little plastic containers   these looked almost the right size  but they had a rounded bottom and were made from some form of  filter  material versus the plastic that i had expected i eventually decided to put one into the machine before tossing the whole thing as having bought the wrong stuff   really glad i did   they are for k cup   the coffee has a nice strong  french roast flavor   the packaging is minimalistic and doesn t look like what i m used to for k cups   i don t know if the added flavor is based on the packaging or the coffee   either way  i m happy with it  great french roast flavor,1,0

3375,i like the clean sweet flavor of this coconut juice  no off flavor aftertaste  i ve probably tried 90  of all coconut waters commercially available in the united states  i usually rate them by garbage  bad  okay  and superior  this coconut water would fall under the superior category  note  pulp means there s small soft easily swallowed pieces of coconut floating throughout the beverage  the first time i tried pulp it took some getting used to  now i like drinking pulp but if you ve never tried it i would not recommend starting out with a case  clean sweet flavor without off flavored aftertaste,1,0
3374,okay so i didn t expect anything spectacular but both my husband and i tried this and we were both a little dumbfounded  i don t really know how to explain it and all my husband had to say was it tasted  soft  we have filtered water and it there was a difference  this water is refreshing  worth the price  ummm  not in my opinion  i think we are an average household and there s no way we would afford to drink this on a regular basis  we do want to stress that we did like the water  but not for this price  i ll stick to my filtered bottled water  it tastes ultra clean,1,0
3373,this water is what the description says   smooth  and jolted with some extra minerals to help out after a hard workout ingredients   water  baking soda  dipotassium phosphate  salt that dissolves very easily  this also controls acidity   magnesium sulfate  epsom salt  and calcium chloride my original take before drinking the water was  why on earth can t we just eliminate all the ingredients except for   you know   that water    well  after downing 50 7 ounces after a workout where i was dripping wet with sweat  i think i can answer my own question   no  the water didn t taste better or magically make me feel like i didn t just workout   but  as an alternative to powerade or gatorade  drinking a bunch of this essentia water to restore electrolytes is much better than all the red  40 and high fructose corn syrup you ll find in the flavored junk recommend    it s water   with some extras added ,1,0

3421,i bought this last month 12 bottles for 13 95 and now this month it is 21 00   why did you double the price its good  but not worth 2 00 a bottle   i understand price goes up 10  but 100     this is not good   won tbe buying you tea again at this price  doubled the price,1,0
3396,my dog gives this 2 big paws up   now  to be fair  he likes almost any food  but i think i detected  if possible  an even greater enthusiasm than normal for this one   when he had gobbled it up  he sniffed all over to see if possibly there might have been a crumb dropped anywhere  and then came to me to see if perhaps i felt like giving him an extra helping   and  not that it matters  but this food does look fancier than the normal dog food i feed him  with some of the kibbles resembling hunks of meat   i was also impressed that the first ingredient was beef  although there was also lots of other stuff that was nowhere near natural   i would also say that the softness of the beef look kibbles is probably not great for his teeth  but maybe that s not a problem for you if you brush your dog s teeth   but definitely for taste  attractive look  and beef content  i give this a high rating  my dog loves it   1st ingredient beef  too ,1,0
3398,the product itself is good  supposed to be different fruit flavors but i can t tell the difference  however my local grocery has these for  2 each and had a  1 off coupon a while ago  i suppose if you can t find them anywhere then you might have to pay this price    check you local grocery first,1,0
3419,these are very tasty and quite honestly  better than any other i have had  after a heart attack i started eating little to no fat and bison is the key  it taste even better than beef jn my opinion  most people wouldn t even know the difference as far as this product is concerned  i only gave it 4 stars because of the description  they are not individually wrapped but are in packs of 5  the do contain a very small amount of beef  and you get 10  2 packs  of smoked bratwurst and 10  2 packs  of bar b que flavored bratwurst they are not cheep at a bit more than  3 a piece but your health is worth the expense  great bratwurst  poor description,1,0
3418,one of the reasons this liquid smoke is so good is that it has no added fillers or coloring   read the label on stubbs or colgin   they contain molasses and spices and other stuff   this just waters down the smoke flavor   you end up needing to use less of cedarhouse because you are getting more smoke flavor in each drop   i had to come to amazon and order online because  here in the deep south of columbus ga i could not find a single store selling pure liquid smoke  the real deal  read the ingredient label,1,0
3417,we bought this for my husband cause he loves ghost chili peppers  we thought everything was going great but after the leaves sprouted before they were able to be transplanted the leaves turned brown and died  dont know if we did something wrong or if its just cause we live in ny and they arnt meant to grow here alright,1,0
3416,this tea should be treated as a laxative  i have horrible problems with bloating and cramping so i take this sometimes  i d advise using it only when you are going to be home for a long time  p and don t drink more than one cup a day unless its an emergency  i made that mistake once     t ti really hate the taste but i suppose that is probably different person to person  i think it s the senna itself i hate  not the carob chocolate  taste  because i ve tried other senna teas and they have that same disgusting flavor    i just drink it with my nose pinched xd works well  tastes awful ,1,0
3415,i m not a big coffee drinker  but when comparing illy s issimo coffee drink to other canned coffees  like those from starbucks  the taste seems a bit less  natural    instead of tasting the lowfat milk and cocoa that the can mentions in upper case  reassuring letters  i seem to taste the cellulose gum and artificial coloring  and no cocoa whatsoever one thing i did like about illy s canned coffee is that it wasn t as sweet as starbucks   i find the older i get the less sweet i like things to be   i also liked the size of the can since i m not a big fan of post coffee jitters illy s coffee isn t bad  but it isn t really anything special either   i d buy it again if something else wasn t available  or if i was in the mood for something less sweet  not a bad canned coffee  but i ve had better,1,0
3414,first rolled hide that hasn t given moose explosive poops  so good there  he is able to completely consume one 9 10  roll in one day  so bad there  at least i think he s not getting toxic waste  but he is a compulsive chewer at 7 months  and i m saving the kitchen cabinet fronts  table edges  legs  chair feet and any book or paper in the room from being shredded  wholesome hides seem a little weak,1,0
3413,i have an 8 month old  85lb pure bred german shepherd that is an insanely strong chewer   both amazon and the pet supply industry have made a killing off me as i have bought nearly every chewable product out there from stuffed animals to elk antlers until now  nothing has met my big four criteria 1  taste   obviously  otherwise the dog wouldn t touch it2  durable   it needs to last longer than an hour3  clean   femur bones are great if you are ok with a chipped tooth and picking blood marrow chunks out of the carpet4  cost   i refuse to buy expensive bully sticks at  12 stick when they last 10minmy dog loves this ring   he lies down  puts one arm through the center to stabilize it and then has at it   it s important to note that it makes him use all his teeth   the ring design throws him off and he s got to strategize a bit   at first  he uses his front teeth to pick away at it and then he uses his chompers once he s cut through a section i bought this thing last week and he has only made it half way through   case in point   this thing is great   buy it   do it now  hallelujah   my prayers have been answered ,1,0
3397,we have two male liter mates now three years old  they think this selective formula 31 and formula 34 29 are their treats  they gobble it down  leaving nothing  we usually feed them maine coon formula 31  but unfortunately they are turning up their noses at it  they are extremely spoiled i d give this food a five star rating  but it s way too expensive  my two maine coon brothers love it ,1,0
3412,i decided to try the liquid form of sweet leaf instead of the powder this time  i love my ice coffee and iced tea  and with the powder it would clump  it was still ok  but i felt like i was using more just to get the sweetness  powder it totally good with hot tea or coffee    this is my second day using the liquid form  and i love it   i m hoping it lasts longer compared to the 3 pack box of sweet leaf packets which would last me exactly 2 weeks and that would cost me  20  so i m hoping by spending  10 more for the liquid  that this lasts longer   also i read about people complaining of the taste or aftertaste   you get that with anything you try differently  i know when i used splenda and i switched to sweat leaf i wasn t thrilled with the taste  not that it was horrible it was just different from what i was used to  after a little while i was used to the taste  i know now after using sweat leaf for over 6 months if i run out and use splenda or even regular sugar  they taste bad to me now  i totally recommend this product it s a much healthier alternative to no calorie subs  thanks for reading  have a great day    first time user   ,1,0
3410,we love this product  but were shocked to discover nearly a  10 increase in price today   why the sharp increase  why the increase ,1,0
3408,at room temperature  this is a hard  almost wax like substance  you pretty much end up shaving the top with a spoon  resulting in a crumbly mess  i really didn t want to stick it in the microwave  but i m far too lazy to heat it any other way  so i did  30 seconds in the microwave pretty much tranformed it into something far creamier and more pleasant  kind of like grainy almond butter    only better because it tastes like coconut  and i adore coconut  yes  it is grainy  which is to be expected from a product made from dried coconut    some say floury  which i can see  it doesn t bother me  and i eat a whole lot of it on apple slices  or drizzled over sliced bananas with shaved dark chocolate the thing that really irritates me about this product is the hype  good god  it s pureed coconut  it s a nice treat  but it is certainly not worth the effort of finding it  for me anyways   near impossible  or the money it costs  i feel like a bit of a sucker for believing half the people on here saying it tastes like the nectar of the gods or something  artisana does not throw magical fairy dust in their product  you could easily make your own with a decent food processor and a bag of organic coconut flakes  i like it ,1,0

3406,i have been purchasing my dog s food at costco  i have been mixing the chicken and lamb kirkland brand with the more expensive organic kirkland mix  my two dog s  akita and black lab  have been eating their food for a couple of years now and seemed to be enjoying it enough  however when i added the beneful to the mix of the other two foods they absolutely loved it  they ate it in record time  wow what enthusiasm  i have since run out of this 15 5 lb bag and purchased some more from costco  now they hardly eat the kirkland brand  i had to go and purchase a 50 lb bag of beneful and mix it in again to get them to eat their food i don t know how it tastes but i can say that my dogs both love it  i have been adding diatomaceous earth powder to their bowls mixed with one raw egg lately and they are really liking it  they seem to have more energy too  i am trying to rid them of any internal parasites  i am also rubbing it into their coats to control fleas and ticks  my two dogs love it,1,0
3405,i basically grew up eating fresh caspian sturgeon and caviar  until it became scarce in 1980 s   hence  i have first hand knowledge of what the real stuff should look and taste like this arrives neatly packaged in bubble cardboard  in glass jars with metal lids  and label states it s a product of island   shipping did not take long  only about 5 business days the taste and smell is unbelievably the very same taste smell of the real thing   texture is nice and pops  although quite a bit smaller than real stuff   overall  try the old russian method of eating this   nice  firm slice of freshly baked white bread spread with butter   then thinly spread this caviar all over it   this is the way we ve always ate it  and the experience is unbeatable   the worst thing you can do is put this on a dry  salty cracker   or  eat it in any other way for that matter i ordered two jars at once and paid the same shipping  so it was  5 per jar   i am planning to order a lot more  probably 5 jars at a time   supermarket sells real osetra  sturgeon  caviar at  80 per 1 5 oz      american caviar at  45 for 3oz     come on guys  this is no rocket science   this stuff is the way to go   from now on  i m totally sold and a loyal customer  superior taste   ,1,0
3403,my wife buy s this  desiccated  coconut  dried and finely shredded   for baking slices and cookies particularly anzac cookies  an australian recipe    it is an excellent product  please read item description before buying this  it is not powdered coconut for coffee s and curries etc i see poor ratings due to misunderstanding of what this product actually is  desiccated coconut powder,1,0
3399,i really like the concept of this brand  in fact  i was quite thrilled reading all of the ingredients the biscuits are dry and a bit on the hard side  but despite being a bit older  my dog ate any that were proffered to him  the crunchy bits are probably good for cleaning his teeth  he s a 10  year old 80lb doberman weimaraner mix and not a picky eater  but he wasn t overly excited when offered the treats  maybe he was just wary of the new food  he seemed relatively pleased after the first taste because he begged for another  however  later that night he had a bit of an upset stomach and had to go out more than once i know that dogs may typically have a range of upsetting digestive reactions to new foods  i d advise only offering one or two treats until their digestive system has a chance to adjust i think i m going to give it a few more days to see if he adjusts and still can happily enjoy the treats because i d much rather give him these than the fake bacon garbage  like the concept,1,0
3411,ok so here is the deal  most  if not all  of the companies offering shilajit capsules dont have but 5  fulvic acid  the shilajit used in those capsules are not extracted from top of mountains  but somewhere from bottom  fyi    shilajit found on top of himalaya is much mush more potent    the shilajit smells like tobacco ish and kind of metallic  this powder is 100  pure raw shilajit in its most potent form  shilajit is not cheap  so companies offering shilajit for  5 for 100 capsules have nothing but fake stuff in there  raw shilajit with 45  fulvic acid  awesome,1,0
3469,this is way  way  way overpriced dont buy it here  costco sells the 48 ounces bag for  6 97  note that this item is only 40 ounces  over priced,1,0

3543,i have two dogs  a german shepherd and a beagle   they absoluey love this grilled sirloin  in order for them to chew it without devouring and not swallowing it  i mix it with their regular dry food  calms them down a bit  it s not crunchy  it s softer dry food  very moist  they had no adverse reactions to it either  no diarrhea etc  dogs devour it,1,0

3541,i have the catit fountain with the blue plastic which is pictured  which is why i bought it  but i received the package with the green plastic catit fountain on the cover with a different serial number  after opening the package and inspecting the filters i see that they are basically the same thing and will also work with my fountain  so if you are like me and have the blue plastic fountain  don t sweat it  if you get the package with the green plastic fountain on the front they still work  green  blue  it s all the same ,1,0
3540,i bought 2 of these gift basket before christmas for  24 total for both  at that price you couldn t beat it  at the current price i would not buy  the appearance of the basket was good  and the people i gave it to were very impressed  i really don t know why the price could go from  12 shipped to around  51 shipped  wait til christmas time to buy  i bought before christmas for cheap,1,0

3538,saf yeast is great  i only gave it 4 stars to draw attention to how i ended up massively overpaying for it  i do recommend dividing it up into 2 or 4 oz  portions and vacuum packing and freezing them  they will remain active and you can use all of the product i have found it for sale at the anderson s chain in ohio for  5 lb  i had forgotten they sold it i got burned when i didn t carefully track the amount of  eligible  amazon free shipping items  and got hit with a  8 shipping charge  at least we all know how amazon pays for the  free shipping   yes live and learn  buyer beware,1,0
3545,why aren t shiitake mushrooms canned more often   if you buy this product  you will know why   the salt water inside the can doesn t taste that good   by contrast  the salt water inside cans of both button mushrooms and straw mushrooms is quite delicious and it s difficult to resist the temptation to drink it all down as if it were soup   apparently  shiitake mushrooms will make the fluid that they are soaked in taste bad   but the shiitake mushrooms themselves can be quite delicious to eat   yes  up to half of these cans will arrive slightly dented   that s normal when buying canned foods from amazon com   but it should still be easy to open all of the cans   cans that are severely dented on both the top and bottom cannot be opened but that problem usually occurs only with very large cans and never with small cans like these   the most delicious way to eat these canned juvenile shiitakes is to   1 wipe away any dust from just one side of the can   the side that you plan to open    2 open the can with a can opener    3 drain away all of the brine  salt water  by pressing down hard with the opened lid  just as you would when opening a can of tuna in water    4 eat these small shiitakes as is   you have now successfully squeezed away the bad taste from these mushrooms    5 to make these young mushrooms even more delicious  you can now add worcestershire sauce directly into the can but you would be reducing the healthfulness of this treat   product of china  shiitake mushrooms are usually sold fresh or dried  not canned,1,0
3537,i do not know what a  jones is talking about  i have been using coconut oil for over three years and have never stored it in the frig  coconut oil is not milk it does not need to be stored there  coconut oil is solid below 75 degrees  i buy my coconut oil at from vitacost 54 oz for  21 00  everything i have read is it will last 2 3 years  i use it everyday for cooking  a 54 oz bottle lasts me about 2 months so  i use it up way before it could ever go bad  lol  jratt1956,1,0
3535,my dogs are just crazy about these biscuits   when i try to give them some of costco s kirkland dog biscuits they give me this sad look before they reluctantly take them   the  blue doggies  get a much better reaction   i have to admit that i tasted them and they really do taste good   they are however  a little too hard for human consumption  my dogs love these,1,0

3531,this is for ethnic hair  the marketing is a a bit poor for it  and it doesn t explicitly say so on the packaging  i thought it would be good for my thick hair for after swimming  it is not i did  however  give to one my my friends who can benefit from it  she noted that it works very well  adding needed moisture to her hair  it is not overly greasy as many other hair products for her can be  she recommends it  for ethnic hair  not clearly stated though,1,0
3530,i love passion fruit  but it is hard to find  especially in a 100  juice product   this is really good for juice concentrate   watch out  though   last december i thought i was ordering more 100  juice  but received ready to drink 10  juice instead   the description said each can contained 2 cups of fruit  which was not the case  and amazon refunded my purchase price   i am about to place my 4th order for the concentrate  i love passion fruit ,1,0
3529,i ate all 6 cans within the first 48 hours   at that rate  i would become the fattest man on earth in a short time   in addition to good taste  this product has other advantages    1 this beef is prepared in a way that there are no cancer causing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  no cancer causing heterocyclic amines  almost no increase in the amount of cancer causing dietary advanced glycation endproducts  dages   and this beef contains only a minimal amount of cancer causing nitrosamines  which are always present in salt    2 this beef is very soft   even softer than corned beef    3 there are no bones or arteries  tastes way  way too good for me to ever reorder it again,1,0
3528,this product arrived in about three days   never use the entire packet for one recipe unless you like hot seasonings   it is extremely hot  malay chicken seasoning,1,0
3536,the ham is good and it tastes not as salty as other serrano hams but if you don t want to spend much more money in a bellota ham it ll be fine  you ll like it the only issue or misunderstanding was because the other reviews  because according to them  it was supposed to come with a ham stand and a knife and it didn t  good serrano ham but no ham stand included,1,0
3527,the kit is good enough quality  i bought this after a friend showed me how to brew on a similar kit  so this was my first batch on my own  some words of warning  first  the cleaning solution that comes with this kit is not a sanitizer  second  make sure to install your airlock before placing the lid on your fermentation chamber  the rubber grommet can come lose and fall into your freshly fermenting wort  quality kit,1,0
3546,i had a craving and realized none of the stores sell these since i guess they think it s bad for kids   meaning looks like cigs   i guess they are right but they should make it easier for adults to get them for their own use rather than having to order 24 packs and pay for shipping too  there s 8 pieces of gum in each box  flavor runs out very quickly but i don t regret buying   was feeling nostalgic     mission accomplished  just like i remembered,1,0
3548,i wasn t expecting much of this product given that i generally don t like green mountain coffee  but to my surprise this was a very good tasting dark roast  it has a strong flavor and nice aroma but not too bitter or watered down  it also had a good pricing for the 18 pack compared to other products  i think i m going to purchase this again  note  i drink my coffee black so my tasting of the flavor is exact  pretty good dark roast,1,0
3565,this product is of very good quality  i was disappointed though in the way the product was packed as much of the biscotti was broken during shipment  great product,1,0

3561,this product is cheap  tastes delicious  and very easy to make  i give it four stars because of those reasons however  it is high in sodium  510 mg  21  of the daily value for sodium  it is also made in china  land of the melamine laced human and pet food  i won t be buying again because of those reasons  i bought this japanese soup item originally because it was advertised as being in business since 1622  i wished they would have mentioned how long the product has been manufactured for them in china  love the flavor  hate the salt  made in china too,1,0
3560,after enjoying the flavor of a jasmine tea i ordered in the blue ocean thai restaurant in astoria  or  i sampled at least 3 brands before i discovered this triple leaf tea   not only is it the flavor i was looking for  but it is decaf  which i require  now ordering my 12th box  found the taste i ve been looking for,1,0
3559,i stopped using this product and switched to a less expensive alternative  after 2 recalls from the other food manufacturer i am back to using blue buffalo which seems to do pretty good with food manufacturing and avoiding contamination  i guess you get what you pay for  cheaper options seem to lack current good manufacturing practices to ensure a high quality product  i work with an organization that deals with cgmp for manufacturing processes every day  so i m not bad at recognizing a serious manufacturer following cgmp  i m paying a little more but i care about my dogs so i don t mind  excellent food  had to switch back to it,1,0
3547,made the effort to locate the euro version of maggi  which this product description specifically calls out   when it arrived  it was the china version with the yellow cap update  bumped to 4 stars   vendor promptly acknowledged error  sent us the german version at their expense   appreciate good customer service  i received the chinese version   update,1,0
3558,i have been consuming these coconut bars for several months now after having purchased a small box at homegoods  these bars are delicious  they taste like the inside of a mounds bar  only 2 ingredients  shredded coconut   rice syrup  i have purchased the 20 pack box through amazon a few times  one of the latest boxes contained bars that tasted odd  they were darker in color and did not have the fresh coconut taste i was used to  perhaps they were in a delivery truck that was hot and the oil in the coconut started to go rancid  anyway  i contacted the company  oskri  and their quality department was great  they provided a return shipping label for the unconsumed bars and shipped out a brand new box of 20 bars plus some additional samples to try  i have read some other reviewers that said they didn t like the taste of the bars  it s too bad they didn t try to contact the company because i m sure they would have sent out a replacement product  i did notice though that the nutrition information has changed even though the weight   contents of the bar are the same  the calories  fat   sugar have all increased  180 cals vs  246 cals  11 grams vs  14 grams  14 grams vs  29 grams   that is unfortunate  and i will have to cut down on my consumption  however  these bars really do taste yummy  they are soft  chewy  sweet   fresh  my husband and i love them  and i have gotten a few friends hooked on them too  a favorite snack ,1,0
3555,i have a hairless cat  and the breeder fed the kits royal canin to begin with so i stuck with it  in the beginning  i noticed he would frequently get gassy and had the smelliest farts constantly   friends would joke that i was using him as a scapegoat     anyway  after i switched to the special 33 formula it stopped  so i think it was what fixed it   he loves this stuff and doesn t even eat canned food at all  my sphynx loooves this,1,0
3554,i enjoyed the senseo coffee pods for 2 years  and now they become so expensive since senseo withdrawn from the us market google it and found others had the same problem too  tried one of the suggestions from others  switched to baronet coffee pods larger size of pods  so you will need the coffee duck to hold it in search amazon for the following product to use   coffeeduck classic  permanent refillable coffee filter for the senseo models hd7810 hd7812baronet coffee french dark roast  18 count coffee pods  pack of 3 it worked for me for 1 month now  it s not as much chroma as this product  but similar price with more coffee per pod in it  now i can make a full cup 3 4th actually  of coffee using the senseo machine used to be a pod for half cup of coffee using this product  the trick is to wet the top part of the pods with water after putting it in the coffee duck  press the 1 cup brewing  wait for it to finish and the blinking red light become steady again senseo machine heated up the water   press the 1 cup brewing again  when it s half way through stop the senseo machine by pressing the power button now i have a 3 4 cup full of coffee  not too dark and not too light  you can control it to your liking  so expensive now  replaced with baronet coffee pods for my senseo machine,1,0
3553,i e mailed the company to clarify the source of the  gelatin  in this product   they responded that they use agar  or vegetable gelatin   in my opinion  they should make this clear on the packaging   i do think it is misleading to list gelatin  instead of agar  or vegetable gelatin otherwise  my dogs like these treats and they are easy to cut into small pieces for training   worked well for training my dog to walk on the leash without pulling  they are vegan ,1,0
3552,my little dog loves sweet potatoes  so this seemed like the perfect treat   the  chips  weren t what i expected  but she loves them   the  chips  are big slices of sweet potato  and are soft  not crunchy   i was disappointed at first  but misha begs for them  so that s what counts   the slices are too big for my little girl  but cutting them into smaller sizes isn t a problem   will definitely order again   it s a shame they are made in china  but i guess they are too expensive to make in america   they are irradiated  according to the fda   food irradiation is the process of exposing food to ionizing radiation to destroy microorganisms  bacteria  viruses  or insects that might be present in the food   so they are safe for our four legged babies  yummy treat,1,0

3550,no matter how wholesome a snack may be  it s worthless unless the girls approve  in this case they both give the science diet jerky treats two paws up  i like that beef is the first ingredient in the recipe and there are none of those unrecognizable ingredients created in a science laboratory the treats are a nice size and have just enough chew to satisfy  for piper  our shih tzu with a few missing teeth  i break the treats into smaller pieces so she can manage them  on the package use within 3 weeks of opening 100  satisfaction guaranteedkeep this bag out of the reach of pets and children  passed the taste test,1,0

3524,when i opened the bag  my wife thought i was making coffee from 3 rooms away within 30 seconds   the beans are that oily   i popped one in my mouth  and got zero bitterness   with free shipping  this is significantly cheaper than buying at the grocery  and significantly better   before this we were drinking starsucks sumatra or from a local roaster   these beans kick more ace than both   thanks amazon and reviewers  you were right  lived up to positive reviews,1,0
3522,this was tested by my family of 4  2 adults   11 year old and 14 year old  and we found it tasted filtered and crisp  we found it did not have any weird after taste like some of the other waters  when shopping for water i will look for this product    a nice product  will reach for this product in the store   ,1,0
3521,my cat likes this food and it actually smells pretty good to me  like meat    i ordered it because of the probiotic support and because it is supposed to be one of the better foods out there  i figure i would rather feed my cat a better food throughout her life than treat her for failed kidneys later   the only thing i would say about this is the probiotic coating of each kibble tends to break loose during shipping leaving a powder at the bottom of each bag which is a little annoying  and my cat does not like the powder   will order again,1,0
3489,first off don t be scared by the  product of china  label    the duck used comes from a breed of domesticated duck used primarily for egg and meat production  it was bred from the mallard in china   yes america produces pekin duck too  but have not done a good job at dehydrating the meats in bulk for jerky uses  only for culinary usage and it usually isn t cheap or easy to find 95  of duck meat consumed in the united states is pekin duck  and who knows what percentage of that is actually our own us product   our friendly asian brothers have been farming pekin duck since the days of the 5 dynasty  that s about 1100yrs ago or so  in 1873 nine ducks were exported from china to long island  new york and there are currently from what i can see only a couple of towns in indiana that handle that predominantly for the us markets not all dogs are meant to handle waterfowl  but if they do and you don t like this product then go get a hunting license to make your own duck jerky  would be 5 stars if not a product of china ,1,0
3488,i do love these products  but why so expensive on amazon  i purchase the bread at trader joe s for less than  5 a loaf  i thought that the  14 and change was for more than one loaf  but it indicates that it s only for 24oz  which is one loaf of bread  i love this bread ,1,0
3487,this is a good conditioner   it didn t leave my hair feeling greasy  which some conditioners do  even after rinsing them out   most importantly for me  it did not leave a scent in my hair  and the smell during use was extremely mild another nice aspect of this product is the container   it has a completely flat bottom  so it rests easily in a shower caddy or on the corner of the tub   the conditioner is dispensed from the bottom of the container  which means you don t have to shake it or leave it upside down to get some out there is not anything amazing about this conditioner  but it is a good product that i would use again  good product,1,0

3481,this things taste like a bumblebee  they re fruity and feel kind of carbonated and are easy to drink  i don t think they re actually carbonated but they feel fizzy  mix one into a glass of juice and you wont taste it  i like to drink one before work and another one before i go dancing  then i usually drink another one when i m getting ready to listen to metal  it really gets me pumped  i don t like caffeine because that stuff is dangerous  i want to be healthy and safe while i m moshing  i am the energy king,1,0
3490,we have been using this dog food for a few years   it is one of the better ones on the market the only problem is that they have raised the price way out of line  i can buy this at 29 00 a caseright down the street  i was buying it here when they had it for 27 29  but when they raised the price i said  good bye  to amazon  very good  but way to high in price          ,1,0
3480,let me first say that the packaging looks different than what it shows on the website  it looks and feels antiquated  but what matters is what is inside  correct i tasted essential against 3 other waters  one was a simply filtered water  from refrigerator disperser   another had minerals added  bottled water  and the other one was tap water  which tastes different depending on what part of the country and even in different municipalities  lets just say that essentia won   here are the differences from worst to best   tap water  let s just say its like taking a big gulp of pool water   you know that chlorinated taste   regular bottled water  from local non spring source  reverse osmosis  destilled  and minerals added   it s tasted like any other bottled water  it s ok and this should be the base standard   filtered water  from my refrigerator   i might be biased but the filter does a good at removing chlorine and particulate without removing some minerality  it tastes fresh and clean   essentia  aka  the winner   the mouthfeel is smooth and it coats your mouth  it doesn t weight heavy on you  i guess this might be the electrolytes or ph balance  it was pleasant and reminds me of spring water but not necessarily  refreshing   i believe it will serve its purpose vs some of the sports drinks out there the other thing that bothered me was all the health claims that they make  i guess you could make those for water in itself  at the end of the day i would go for natural spring water over any other source method of bottled water  a more natural taste ,1,0
3478,i love eight o clock dark roast coffee and have had a subscribe and save subscription for a year  this month s shipment was a big disappointment because the coffee in the first 2 bags was flavored and undrinkable  i could not find a place to directly communicate with the seller  all other shipments have been very good  subscribe and save   eight o clock coffee,1,0

3476,i bought the large ball of edam because i can no longer find the 1 lb balls locally   i read mixed reviews on results from freezing   i should have listened to the negative ones because i threw out 2 3 of the purchase   expensive lesson   however  awesome cheese when properly stored  go for the smaller size  and get on the 3 month auto ship program  do not freeze,1,0
3475, length   1 40 minsi was dog sitting for a dog named bulleit and i wanted to test out this product on her  as the video shows  she enjoyed it  she was moderately hungry at the time some reviews have labeled this as  junk food   that s a bit unfair  feeding your dog potato chips and other garbage is worse  this product certainly isn t the worst thing you can give your dog  it may not be the most nutritious dog food ever  but it s not junk food i review for wanderlearn  my dog loves it  calling it  junk food  is a bit extreme,1,0
3474,these are exactly the brach candy i was looking for   another reviewer was disappointed that they weren t what they were expecting  but these taste just the same as the ones i used to buy at the grocery store  but can t find anymore  exactly what i was looking for,1,0
3473,i expected these to have a firmer texture  like what you get at the frozen yogurt shops  not so  the texture is much closer to a marshmallow  but  they tasted very good  would i buy them again  no  much softer than i expected,1,0
3472,good  big  crisp  snowy white kernels with few duds  pops quickly  25  faster than name brand yellow corn in the same microwave and popper   decent price and package size   enough to last awhile  not so much as to go stale before it runs out bad  almost tasteless   butter and salt are not optional orville redenbacher still leads the pack  but this stuff is pretty good and costs a lot less   four stars  would have been five if it were even a little less bland  pretty good stuff,1,0
3479,this coffee is very good  the first couple of cups brewed fine  some of these k cups the inside paper filter does not touch the bottom so when put into the brewer the paper filter is not punctured and the water can not pass thru it fast enough and it overflows  tested other brands of k cups and they work fine so it is not my machine  good coffee   defective k cup,1,0
3492,this order was returned and refunded after i waited nearly thirty days   i reordered again and we are waiting patiently   i have received your products and items to military pos before using an fpo  usmc    now  the apo ae address i have provided was not accepted   the refund went through right away to my credit card   so  not only are we disappointed  we are without coffee   i ordered three five pound bags   we love the french roast and italian roast both and we are now trying brazilian santos   i have also enjoyed the chocolate before   all are great products  well packaged and at a reasonable price   i would hope the orders can be filled by adapting your order form for military postal deliveries  delivery problem,1,0
3494,this is definitely a step up from the iq ball as far as the level of difficulty   my border collie was very frustrated by it for the first few week  so he barked at it incessantly  now he has fun with it  and it keep him busy  giving him a  job  to do   i really wish this were made of a hard rubbery material like the kong toys  as the hard plastic makes it very noisy when my dog knocks it around on the hardwood floors  trying to get the treats out  consequently  i can t let him play with it while i m teaching piano lessons  great but noisy,1,0
3495,picked up a pack of these for a gold panning excursion  they work well and are a good size for displaying your finds  they are glass  albeit tough  so care should be taken while handling  gold ,1,0
3520,i agree that the price on this is a bit high  but our dog loves it and still goes crazy whenever it s meal time   she didn t do well with many of the so called organic products because they still contain a lot of low quality grains starches   even better  there s less dog waste to clean up too because the product doesn t have useless fillers  dog loves it,1,0
3517,i ve had this salt before and purchased more  cause i like it  however  when i opened the box i could smell the fragrance of the product  i found the seal on the jar was broken and the lid was loose  this vendor  kiva health brands llc  obviously has no compunction about selling a food item with the safety seal compromised  there are two other reviews complaining of the same problem and i can t image how the seal would break in transit  four stars for the product itself but one star for the handling casina rossa truffle and salt by nicola de laurentiis   3 5 oz  product good   package handling poor,1,0
3516,the blueberry is very tasty but watch out when you open a bottle  we have now had 3 bottles that were bad  usually when you open a bottle it smells nice  on those 3 occasions  in 3 different orders the juice smelled sour  kind of vinegary  and there was a large odd clump in the bottle  we  of course  threw them out and i am trying to contact the company and let them know about this because we really enjoy the product when it s not spoiled  we have not encountered this problem with any other flavor  what s up with that bai5 blueberry,1,0

3513,there seem to be a lot of folks here who complain about the noise of this machine and while it is noisy  it s a commercial grade product with an industrial style pump in it   it s going to make more noise than the home style ones and even keurig says on their website that it s not recommended for home use and isn t ul certified for home use one person who gave it a one star on here was using the drain feature everyday   apparently they didn t bother to read the instructions on the machine   the drain button is for storage and cleaning  not for emptying the machine daily don t trust the descale light   i m sure it s accurate but descale the machine every 3 6 months whether the light comes on or not   also   understand your water if you are using tap water and if you re using bottled water  understand it even more   our tap water is from a well and is  fortunately  fairly soft   87 on the total dissolved solids meter  which goes as high as 999    however  i ve tested various brands of bottled water  some of them have been over 200   so get your water tested or buy a  12 tds meter from amazon and know what you are putting into the machine ours gets used daily  makes 8 10 cups and is on continuously for about eight hours   we clean it as recommended  descale it every 6 months because of our soft water and it has performed flawlessly for eighteen months   our previous keurig was a home model  lasted two years and finally died   i m hoping this one goes for three to four years at which time i would expect it to die   one negative reviewer said they were upset their home keurig died after three years and that keurig was only giving them a partial credit towards a new one   70     good thing i don t run customer service at keurig or they wouldn t have liked what i told them if you re looking for a basic brewer  no bells and whistles other than cup size and auto off  then this is the machine for you   it will be  should be   more durable than their home models and provide the same quality coffee   there are some complaints online about a plastic taste with this brewer   because of that  the first thing i did was thoroughly wash the water reservoir and then did a descale with white vinegar and then a thorough rinse   haven t had any taste issues whatsoever people also complain it s too expensive a way to brew coffee   they are apparently happy with their maxwell house coffee in their mr  coffee and so shouldn t invest in one of these machines   to me  seventy five cents for a cup of coffee to rival starbucks is money well spent and i get to enjoy it in the comfort of my own home   shop around for the k cups  there are huge price differences online and even in retail stores   i just bought 108 k cups of sumatran for fifty eight cent a cup shipped to my door  eighteen months  still going strong ,1,0
3511,it is important to note that this is not bottled spring water like evian bottled water 24 bottles 11 2oz   incidentally  evian spelled backwards is naive   instead this is water that has been purified and then supplemented with calcium chloride  dipotassium phosphate  magnesium sulphate and sodium to adjust the ph of the water  so if you are on a low sodium diet  you probably don t want to drink this when i drank this water  i immediately noted the rather bland taste  the truth is i prefer the taste of the filtered water from my refrigerator water filter or my quixtar filter  however if you feel the health benefits of ph balanced water are legitimate and worth the investment  then this product may be for you  purified water rather than spring water,1,0
3508,this is a scent based animal repellent   cats  raccoons and opossums come into my yard over the fence  or under it  and i sprinkled this product near their entry points   they avoid it for about a week  but i find they tend to enter at other places  if they are coming to feed or to bother my cat  they wreak their havoc anyway   water  either sprinklers or rain  completely inactivates the product i don t use scent based repellents much any more   if i were trying to protect a very small area   say  a patio   this might do  but there is no way to use this kind of product to protect a whole yard  as good as any animal repellent,1,0
3507,for me  the only use for this is baking or making chocolate sauces out of it   it s just too bitter to eat plain and it doesn t really taste much until your mouth melts it   that is  if you chew it up  it s pretty much tasteless until it melts in your mouth   at that point  however  it s just too bitter for me   i made a chocolate sauce with cream and a little sugar and it was wonderful over ice cream  and even just plain  the little bit of sugar cuts the bitterness a lot    by the way  be prepared to chop the pieces   as is  they are a little large for anything  unless you re just going to melt them in a double boiler  really great for baking,1,0
3506,the product is excellent  which is why i gave it 5 stars    i don t believe in reviews of a product that are based on service however when i bought this item they advertised it by the kilo    at the time it was 2 2 kilos    and sold it to me by the pound  so if you do decide to order  take a screen shot and then check your order receipt carefully  i m going elsewhere  bait and switch,1,0
3505,trapped 7 10 flies within the first 2 hours of use  it s been 24 hours and there must be 20 30 flies in there now  this is just outside a back entrance to a house and it has really kept down the number of flies that get in  it seems to work much better than the homemade traps i ve put together before  very  very effective ,1,0
3504,i previously tried ordering floss sugar in the cartons  that was a big mistake  the boxes arrived with their bottoms stained and discolored  i questioned where and how they d been stored  i threw them out  these jars of floss sugar arrived so unbelievably fresh looking  we had every confidence in their safety  i love we can close them tight  they performed and tasted great  better in the jar,1,0
3503,good tasting water   this is a big bottle of water  1 5 liters is equivalent to about 4 soda cans or 6 glasses of water   plastic bottle is not as flimsy as most water bottle which crumples on your hand   normal ph level of water is between 6 5 to 8 5  whereas pure water is 7 and  less than 6 5 ph may be acidic or called soft   acidic is considered not good for your heath if it is what you drink most of the time   hard water is above 8 5 ph  and considered not so much of a risk to your health than acidic if you drink a lot of water bottles  this is a good alternative for many of the popular brands already in the market  good tasting water ,1,0
3502,i purchased this from kroger as an alternative to a stevia based sweetener  which i am pleased with    currently i m non diabetic and eat ludicrous amounts of cold cereal  plants  and dairy   i just tried four packets of the nectresse in a five cup peach flavored hot tea   i like it   my palate is usually more bitter sour so i can be turned off by too much empty sweetness   i agree with another review that this product s taste is fruitier than other sweeteners   aftertaste doesn t affect my favorable opinion ingredients  erythritol  sugar  monk fruit extract  molasses made from monk fruit,1,0

3498,a pack of 12 is a huge amount of noodles  they are standard sized packages  like spaghetti noodle sized packages  the price when i bought it was better than the price at the grocery store  eden is a high end brand that i really trust  there is a difference between these and ones made in china  i ll leave it at that hope that helps  massive amount of noodles,1,0
3497,just received a keurig coffeemaker for my birthday and wanted to try some different flavors   i thought i would have to buy bigger packages of all one flavor and hoped i would like them   found this on amazon and what a great way to try flavors   i now know which ones to buy and which ones to pass on   the company was very prompt in getting the product to me   i had picked a few flavors they didn t have and they promptly messaged me and i was able to pick something else   package arrived within a week of putting in order   i would definitely order from them again  pick your own flavors k cups,1,0
3772,this is bright  fresh tasting and colorful unlike some sludgy  gritty  dull colored pistachio butters  perhaps it is the small amount  and imperceptible tasting  of olive oil  the texture is creamy but with a little nuttiness to it ie this isn t creamy like skippy peanut butter  if you want to make gelato  however  you should use a sweetened sicilian pistachio butter  this one is a lovely alternative to almond butter or any other nut butter  and so pretty  colorful and pure,1,0
3370,i have been using 5 hour for years  and it works great  take it every day   saw the kirkland the other day  compared ingredients and looked identical to me  so i grabbed a 48 pack for the same price   35  as the 5 hour 24 pack  so 1 2 the price   absolutely has the same effect  and why wouldn t it since it is the same stuff   i think 5 hour peeps sent a few shills to post here maybe  maybe not  but let s see       same product  same results  1 2 the price  no brainer  mikeinsocal,1,0
3776,i have been using this food for my 3 dogs for over a year  it is a product that they dont an allergic reaction to and is high in proteins and fish oils  the price has been increasing recently and through cajunmarket info i was able to save some money over what the local stores charged  pet food discount rates,1,0
3778,i usually love orgain vanilla and have been consuming cartons of it for the last few months  through amazon   while it is expensive  the convenience of opening a tetrapack at night outweighs the cost  the ingredients are greatjust recently i had an awful experience  the latest cartons i ordered had a petroleum taste to the product  i opened 6 atleast to find one that did not taste bad but to no avail  luckily amazon refunded me i spoke with orgain and it seems that this was a batch specific issue  mixed experience,1,0
4066,i used to buy a much more expensive vanilla bean sold here on amazon  feel free to search for my username and see how much i used to over spend i decided to try this option because i would not be in a bind if they were of poor quality or i did not like them ordered them up and they arrived in a few days  the smell was wonderful and i am quite pleased with the quality i will definitely purchase again  just like mom used to make,1,0
4065,i don t know why clear won t just say that the gold line is for black people   at the store  all the gold products are with the black hair products and the other products are with caucasian hair products anyway  as for hair grease  it is no better than any other hair grease on the market   for oiling the scalp  i like this clear product better clear scalp   hair beauty therapy ultra shea nourishing scalp   hair oil  3 fluid ouncethis particular product moisturized the scalp well and does not have an overwhelming smell   i would purchase the hair oil over the container grease though  this is hair grease  all the gold container clear products are for black people ,1,0
4062,you should prob steer clear if you wanna buy this to smoke   its alright but not what i was hopeing this is meant for drinking    it good,1,0
4061,i didn t buy this from amazon  but i have bought this before  i use it for cake pops  it tastes better than the colored candy melts they sell at the stores and it hardens better too  the candy melts are hard to melt and stay chunky and clumpy making it necessary to add shortening  the shortening makes it harder for the candy to quickly dry and harden  it s also difficult to use edible markers on the candy melts because of the shortening  makes it oily  with this almond bark  it melts down to a silky smooth consistency and you can write perfectly with edible markers  also  the candy dries to a nice crunchy candy shell  the way it should be   smells and tastes delicious ,1,0
4059,the missing star  originally two  is because this product is melted into a gummi  splat   there are no gummi bear formations   another minus  it is hard to open packets and we have to use scissors  and then the treat is melted into corners so our scissors get dirty sticky   however  my colleagues loved them   they looked for melting patterns and talk about looking for packs with  more red   or  green melted with green   etc   so they get a star back    gummi bears   ,1,0
4058,like another review said   it s water  clear  refreshing  water   the taste   watery   meaning next to no taste after effects   i was hydrated  just like most water does conclusion   i could buy this water  be hydrated and it doesn t have any funky taste   but i could do the same thing with my water filter  i am not sure how to do reviews about water,1,0
4056,my baby skipped the purees and would not touch rice cereal  these puffs were one of her first solid foods when she was about 7 months  they are puffed up air things which easily dissolve in the mounth so there is no choking hazard  most of what is in the container and puffs is air  so don t expect a lot of nutrition out of it  the container has 6 half cup servings of 25 calories  my little one got far more servings out of it  it is just to get them used to solid stuff  not to fill them up  unlike the rice cereal  my little one liked these rice based puffs  the vanilla puffs have cute little star shapes  not looking at the label of the container  my husband popped open the lid and ate half the container  he freaked out once i told him he ate baby food but said it tasted pretty good  i tried a few and i must say they are fairly sweet and not bad tasting at all  they are much sweeter than the happybaby brand puffs and that sweeter taste is preferred by my sweeth tooth baby and hubby  the disadvantage of these puffs is that they tend to stick  babies put their fingers in their mouth and end up with drooly fingers  when the little one was picking up the little puffs with her wet fingers  these puffs started sticking to her fingers which was somewhat frustrating for her  the reason i docked one star   baby likes the taste but they stick,1,0
4070,have tried many warm cereals in the past  and sadly haven t had much luck  that was until we found this product  it s a very good tasting breakfast product  we the patents don t even mind eating it  if your child is a difficult eater try this  they may enjoy it cwdaly my son loves this oatmeal ,1,0
4055,5 hour energy was like a dream come true for my working spouse   as a manager  on his feet for thirteen hours a day gets extremely exhausting so when i agreed to receiving a sample from smiley online in exchange for my opinions  he was the first in line to try it   i was impressed that it contained b6  b12   b3 along with folic acid and only had a small amount of caffeine   my husband tried the 5 hour energy after a full day of work in hopes of being able to stay awake and watch the baseball game   he was surprized that did give him a few more hours of energy   5 hour energy also complies with the dietary supplement health and education act as enforced by the fda  the energy booster with no sugar   only 4 calories,1,0
4053,well after many brands of stevia i have finaly found one that is not bitter  i have tried many brands and even some flavored ones and could not drink the stuff  i wanted to switch from splenda and sweet and low in my coffee to stevia as it is a natural product but   yuck i could not get past the bitter taste untill now  the search is over for me  a little goes a long way so take it easy and start with a drop or two and build on that for the sweetness level you desiere  nustevia not bitter,1,0

4049,i ve only eaten sardines for about a year   i heard they were healthy and environmentally friendly  lower on the food chain than tuna or salmon   so i decided to change eating habits i tried a couple other common brands that were on sale  and they were fishy smelling   i had been told long ago that   if a fish smelled  fishy  then it was too old and you shouldn t eat it   but for many months i thought it was normal for sardines to smell this way then i tried season brand and it was a whole different environment   no strong fish smell   i felt like i had gone to a fancy restaurant and had the fish served on a plate rather than in a tin   it was a complete joy to eat these  and i look forward to opening a tin every chance i get   i prefer the oil and the lemon garlic as well as lemon pepper   their anchovies are also wonderful   top notch quality and flavors   never thought sardines could taste this good ,1,0
4048,when i read that this water had a balanced ph and minerals added for taste  i had to try it to see if i could discern any significant difference between it and other bottled still water   i couldn t   it tastes like water  refreshing when cold   after drinking it for a few days  i didn t notice any significant difference in my biological functions   perhaps drinking nothing but ph adjusted water for weeks would make a difference   it didn t do much for me in short  it s decent bottled water   if you like still bottled water in plastic bottles  then you probably would enjoy this as much as any other  it s clean water in a plastic bottle,1,0
4047,dr oz recommended giving these a go  so i did my first impression  not good  fishy and salty second day   less objectionable  but still not enjoyable within a week i have come to like these critters too salty but otherwise very good   now that my palate is used to them  the amount of salt prevents them from becoming a  pig out  issue   in general  i dont like salty  another  acquired taste ,1,0

4046,the tart cherry juice seems to keep my arthritic pain in check  my last subscription was in a plastic bottle   that did leak   however this other brand was discontinued and i used michelle s as a substitute  the flavor is great  the effect is the same  however the 4 bottles were shipped in a box with 1 air bag  they were dented on arrival but did not leak  my question is about the metal bottle  is there a liner  was the liner damaged in shipping  bottle question,1,0
4072,just to clarify  smokehouse makes these in the us and also in china   the ones made in china will cost less than the ones made in the us  the ones made in the us clearly states it on the front of the bag   for those of you that got bags from china  you should check to make sure you ordered the right bag and if so  return it for a refund if they mistakenly sent you the wrong bag  these treats are great  all natural  so they re healthy  good and affordable,1,0
4077,first and foremost  having enjoyed the  blonde  variety of starbucks since it s conception  it s pointless for me to tell you that i buy this product religiously and think it to be the best coffee on the market today   what i can tell you is about the packaging for the 54 count package and my experience with k cups  in general if you opt to go with the higher count package  please note that it does  not  come in retail box packaging   sure  the k cups are the same but  you get a brown box versus several  retail  packages   this  to me  isn t a big deal in the least   it s not a large box and i d rather recycle one box than several smaller ones   my point   if this is an issue to you  buy in a different quantity   secondly  the k cup patent is a great one but  unfortunately for keurig  it s days are numbered   while i ve tried to grind my own beans and use a ecobrew reusable k cup filter to get the same results as the veranda blend k cup  i ve been unsuccessful in getting it  how i want it    as such  i ve continued to pay a higher price per cup of coffee but  in the end  i still think it to be worth it    it s a very unique blend   what i can assure you is that the prices per cup will likely fall off upon the expiration of the k cup patent   for that  i ll keep my wallet handy for these until they hopefully fall off in price due to competition in the near future a  service by amazon  as usual  with prime  a treat in a brown box   ,1,0
4093,the product is excellent   i have been buying it for several years  first at whole foods  and then when they dropped the product  i have been purchasing it online the price has been going up considerably   i purchase 36 jars per order to save on shipping   with each order there is always another price increase my recent order of september 2012 for 36 jars was apparently packed at the warehouse and sent to the store   the store did not repack it   each box of six was sealed with warehouse tape identifying the item   it stated the name of the store it was shipped to as well as the flavor   the following information shocked me  and i quote rigoni fruit sprd  8 82 oz  pack  6  retail  5 99did you note the price   retail 5 99      it did not state wholesale  it said retail price   no one sells it for 5 99  yet the warehouse stipulates that is the retail price   am i missing something here   i guess it is a matter of what the market will bear     outrageous   perhaps on principal alone i will give up on this product   the greed is beyond comprehension  something is very wrong,1,0
4092,anyone that r e a l l y likes sardines prefers the little bitty ones i used to buy a brand that sold  three layer  sardines only seen the single or double  layer variety  lately    and  of course the single layer ones don t actually advertise the fact as they are justbig chunks of chum like  bait  fish i understand that the reason i cannot find three layer sardines is be cause they are now known as either  tiny  or  cross packed  sardines                                                                                                  sardines are healthy because of the oil  and the bones supply calcium    i suppose     hell  i just like them    the little ones  i mean i ll just have to remember that the small  good   ones are now called cross pack                                                                                                    the more layers  the smaller  the smaller the better ,1,0
4091,this is the only tea bags we get here in america  tastes like original pakistani tea  you have to brew it correctly  we throw in 2 teabags per cup into the tea pot  and boil the water inside with the tea bags  then when its boiled  leave it on low heat for 2 5 minutes  and pour  and serve with milk and sugar  taste fantastic  we ve tried lipton  and countless others from from the local grocery store  this came out on top of the favorites list  u wont be disappointed  reminds us of pakistan indian,1,0

4089,my advice is to get this stuff through a person who sells it   i get all 3 blends and it costs me  60 a month   conflicting research   not hardly   the wikipedia site is very biased against juice plus   i know because i looked up all the studies   believe me  the research is there to support it being beneficial by doing things such as boosting the immune system and reducing oxidative stress   and these findings have all been duplicated in randomized  double blind  placebo controlled trials   and ladies and gentlemen  you can t do much better than that however if you just read the wikipedia site to get your info  know this  they slant things   for instance  a study researching juice plus to determine if it reduces oxidative stress might have looked at 5 markers of oxidative stress   maybe the study found that 4 out of the 5 markers did show that juice plus reduced oxidative stress  but one didn t   of course the wikipedia take on this would be making a big deal about the one marker of oxidative stress that didn t show juice plus reduces oxidative stress   now how biased is that  great stuff,1,0

4086,not having had a lot of experience with oil cured olives i did not know what to expect   my impressions is that these olives are a good value  but i found them too salty for my taste   i actually ended up soaking them in fresh water  changed often  for several hours to remove some of the salt   while this helped  i still found them leaving me feeling like i had just consumed a weeks worth of salt   the olives themselves were usually firm  not hard and in a few cases somewhat soft   if these where peaches i would describe them as free stone  meaning the pit is easily removed from flesh  good but very salty,1,0
4084,these are good cookies  but i d hesitate to buy them if you don t like fava flour  it is a taste i don t like and kind of ruins the flavor  4 cookies per snack bag with 3 cookies being a  serving   they do come in a nice looking box which more than one person admired  please look at list of ingredients before buying,1,0
4083,my local supermarket can t keep these in stock  they are so good  all the lay s kettle cooked flavors are good  but this one is especially good  and i don t think it is just a new england thing   you know  sharp cheddar cheese   i think they ve really got the flavor right  on top of how good this new wave kind of kettle cooked chip is anyway why aren t the nutritional facts given by the seller  oh  they re always afraid they might change midstream and someone would complain about accuracy    anyway  my package says ingredients are  potatoes  vegetable oil  sunflower  canola  and or corn oil   sharp cheddar seasoning  maltodextrin  made from corn   salt  whey  natural flavors  cheddar cheese  milk  cheese cultures  salt  enzymes   cream  onion powder  tomato powder  canola oil  yeast extract  butter  cream  salt   swiss cheese  milk  cheese cultures  salt  enzymes   parmesan cheese  milk  cheese cultures  salt  enzymes   garlic powder  paprika extracts  turmeric extracts  allergy information  contains milk ingredients claims no artificial flavors  no preservatives  no msg  0g trans fat  made with all natural potatoes and seasonings  really really good kettle chips,1,0
4082,on sept  10  2012 i did receive my plants in good condition and it was beautiful  but it was not the correct plant   only the ad is misleading  the name of the plant is correct but the picture is not a ming aralia  the ming aralia has long feathery  lacey like leaves   out of the 4 small pictures that are posted below it  the first picture and also the large picture they advertise with are parsley aralia s the 3 smaller pictures are the ming aralia   also the plants i received had a plant tag that also said it was a parsley aralia   but they are two total different looking plants  i contacted hirts by phone the day i received them to tell them i got a parsley aralia and not a ming aralia they asked me to email pictures and to give them the order number and info i also included a copy of the packing slip that came with them and have yet to get an answer or even know if i will get the correct plant  i got this for my son  for his birthday so i don t know what i am going to do because it is not the ming aralia he wanted it is a parsley aralia heard from seller and they are resending my plants  can t wait to get them  misleading,1,0
4081,i saw these pouched soups while i was shopping at wal mart and was surprised to see that they were not only campbell s brand soups but how  out of left field the flavor choices were for campbell s  while different  that didn t immediately make me confident that the flavors would actually be successful i decided to buy only one pouch of the coconut curry chicken to try it out  i like curry so if this worked out yay me  well yay me  this was ridiculously good  while it was heating in the microwave  as it said to do in the directions  the fragrant aromas started seeping out  i was shocked  this smelled almost exactly like when i make coconut curry sauce on my own  it smelled so fresh and authentic  the only thing left to doubt was the taste  surely the aroma was just some canned  chemically manufactured olfactory trick  i was happily proven wrong  the taste and the smell all fit together  and unlike campbell s canned soups  where you had small pieces of of mushy vegetables or meat  here you had big pieces of carrots and chicken and crunchy water chestnuts  the shittake mushrooms were small however  but not negligible seriously try it out for yourself  you won t be disappointed  as for me i m going to go buy a heck of a lot more  coconut curry chicken unexpectedly amazing ,1,0
4080,i got a huge variety of drinks   cider  cocoa  cappuccino  tons of tea  hot and iced  and flavored coffees  in fact  i hardly got any plain coffee  maybe 1 6  i didn t count them  but none of them are expired  i usually won t order something if it has negative reviews   i m so glad i took the chance and ordered these   awesome ,1,0
4079,my son loves these soups particularly the butternut squash bisque  i m a little confused that other reviewers said it lacked texture for a stage 3 food  it is soup people  not even adult soup is necessarily chunky  i think it s a great transition from stage 2 to 3  i would also say that babies on stage 2 could probablyhandle these items  baby soup,1,0
4078,i wanted to kill off some extensive patches of bermudagrass in our kbg lawn  this did the job but did an even better job of killing the kbg wherever it was sprayed    i was aware this would probably happen but the labelling didn t seem to mention bluegrass so i thought there was a chance the kbg might survive will mop up bermudagrass survivors with turflon ester  which is not as effective but allegedly a little kinder to kbg  now reseeding bare patches with scott s kbg i rate this four stars as it did what it was supposed to  but could have been labelled a little better  kills bermudagrass  also bluegrass,1,0
4085,at first  i thought amazon sent me the wrong product since it didn t look like the picture   but on the front of each jar were the words  new package  same great taste    the new plastic containers are thinner and taller with an hourglass shape to them   ultimately  though  it s the same product folgers makes good instant coffee   and  for the last few times i ve purchased coffee  it s always been folgers   but  this was primarily because my  truly  favorite brand couldn t be found locally  or on amazon    that s why i took away one star   which is no reflection on folgers quality or taste   my favorite brand chase and sanborn instant coffee  7 0 ounce jarlike folgers  they re one of the old brands that have been around since i was a kid  and i m 62    but for me  chase and sanborn instant coffee tastes better   from now on  i ll order that brand even though it s slightly more expensive   and i ll likely give it a full 5 stars  grin   new look to an old product ,1,0

4003,kasha is can be a tricky product to cook and requires an extra step if you want it flaky  not mushy   many people  especially in russian speaking countries  eat kasha as a hot cereal for breakfast   in that case you simply cook it 1 part kasha to 2 parts liquid with some butter and it will get to the consistency of thick oatmeal   to serve it as a side dish say as classic kasha varnishkas  bow tie noodles   you need to first mix each cup of kasha with a beaten egg and toast it in a dry skillet until grains are all separated and browned  cook them as you would with 2 parts liquid and whatever seasoning and vegetables you desire for perfect kasha  kasha as good as you cook it ,1,0

4000,i called the company and got a detailed explanation of everything that was commented  on in the other reviews   the company spent a great deal of time with me explaining the below and seemed sincere change from new zealand to usthe majority of their customer base was primarily attracted to the naturally occurring 8 0 alkaline water  and had an issue with water being trucked half way around the world   most of the customers wanted a similar quality water with less of an environmental impact   so the company made the business decision to follow this feedback and invested a great deal of effort finding three natural springs in the us that are naturally alkaline   water from new zealand is no long available the sources and the water quality report from the new us based springs can be found on their site      distilled waterduring this time an unfortunate mishap happened regarding an order of specially requested water by a department store   this department store requested distilled water   the bottles were labeled differently  but the cases looked the same and unfortunately some of this water wound up being distributed by mistake   the company states they will never create another lot of distilled water and while they regret that this water has hit the market in some areas  it is of limited supply and the issue should dissipate labelingthe original water that was manufactured in new zealand  says  new zealand  on the label   it is no longer being produced   if you are lucky enough to still be in possession of this water  you have a collector s item the new us based water  from the three naturally alkaline springs says source  multi spring  bottled for eternal beverages  walnut creek ca   this is the water the company is basing its future on the distilled water that is out in some markets actually says distilled water on the back of the label   if you are in possession of this water  you have an inferior product my personal opinioni happen to be in possession of the original new zealand water  the new us based spring water  as well as several competing brands  hawaiian springs and mountain valley springs comparing them by taste and smell  my husband and i agree that this is how we would rate the four products   1   new zealand water is the clear winner  it s a shame we no longer have the option to purchase it  2   the us based eternal water is our second choice  3   hawaiian springs is a close second to the us based eternal water  4   mountain valley spring water   note  mountain valley spring water does contain some fluoride  explanation about labeling,1,0
3999,i am normally the last person in the world to willingly drink a cup of coffee  but i was at a friend s house and they made a cup of vanilla skyline and it smelled so good i shocked myself by asking for a cup   not only that  i drank it straight up   no milk  no sugar  just the coffee as it came out of the machine i am now pestering my husband to get one of the machines  but in the meantime i find myself carpooling with her and spending more time at her place than ever before   i hope she will not be lonely once i finally get my husband to cave and get me a machine of my own  not a coffee drinker  but even i like these,1,0

3995,has anyone noticed  the original liquid coffee mate in the 32oz and 64oz bottles taste different   i called the company and was told that they are using a different factory but i compared the ingredients before they completed their transition and the ingredients have changed   not sure why  it tasted fine before   in fact now the original liquid tastes the same as every other cheap imitation out there   i have found that the only way to get the original original liquid formula is in these single 0 375 oz packs   i use them at home bring them with me when i travel  if coffee mate changes these single packs   i will probably have to give up drinking coffee altogether  has anyone noticed ,1,0

3991,not sure if it was the shipping that caused it but when i received the bag  about 1 4 of it was completely powdered  the boba itself was much dryer and more crumbly than i expected  but when it was boiled it turned delicious  i wish that i could have used the last quarter of the bag for boba  but right now i can make a big layer of jelly with it but not much else would order  and am about to  again  but hopefully won t get too much powder this time  great tasting boba  some were turned to powder though   ,1,0

3989,i tried a bunch of the fruity larabar flavors and thought that they were all sickeningly sweet   even with the coconut flavor that people seem to love  i could not finish the box   i just got the chocolate mint jocolate bars and i love them   i think the coco cuts the sweetness a lot   i also like the dryer texture of these rather than the sticky texture of the fruit bars   the same things i like about these bars the one star reviews seem to really dislike  so it seems like it is all about preference   i don t like things that are super sweet   i think milk chocolate is gross  and when i eat chocolate i prefer 85  coco or above   so  maybe those things will be helpful to gauge if you will like these or not  awesome ,1,0
3988,there really isn t much to say about this   if you like freeze dried ice cream  you ll probably like this   like all freeze dried ice cream  it seems ridiculously overpriced for what you get  but that s the way it goes   about a quarter of the tube is filled with smooshed crumbs  but it eats the same   the tube is small  of course   about 1 5 times the height of a chapstick and maybe twice the diameter   it has white  brown  and pink balls  white seems to be the largest    i listed them by color because i can t really say that they taste like vanilla  chocolate  and strawberry because they are so small   all in all  i think i prefer the small bricks better than these little balls  but i kind of enjoyed flipping the top and pouring some into my mouth  small tube filled with freeze dried ice cream balls,1,0

4038,i liked that the 5 hour energy gave me that little extra lift i needed  especially in the afternoon   evenings  when i needed it most   it didn t make me feel jittery or shakey and as other products have  since i have anxiety to begin with   it also didn t keep me from falling asleep at night  the only thing i didn t really like was the taste after taste   it tasted a little bit mediciney to me   but  i just drank something else  like some tea or something after taking the 5 hour energy to get the taste out of my mouth    i received a free sample of 5 hour energy from smiley360   5 hour energy   berry review,1,0

4034,i bought this product with high hopes seeing as how great the reviews were  so i purchased 1 order of the 300 count bags  these bags claim to be resistant to leaks however  are no different from my medela or lansinoh breast milk storage bags that have leaked  when the first bag leaked  the leak occurred at the seam located at the bottom of the bag  i thought it was just a fluke  however i have now had over 15 bags leak  thankfully i was able to see the leak immediately when transferring my pumped milk to the bag for a few  but i can not say the same with the bags i have taken from the freezer to thaw  not only did i lose precious milk  i had a huge mess to clean up in my fridge  i still want to really like these bags  but they keep letting me down  who ever said there is no use crying over spilled milk obviously wasn t talking about breast milk  very disappointing   update    09 28 2012   although it was unfortunate circumstances that brought me to give honeysuckle a bad rating of 2 out of 5 stars  after dealing with their customer service  and receiving replacement bags  i have to give them a higher rating  even though some bags were faulty from the first order i purchased  the replacement bags seem to be holding up thus far  i greatly appreciate working with companies who appreciate their customers and honeysuckle is probably one of the best customer service experiences i have come across  don t be fooled these bags leak  ,1,0

4029,like most melinda s hot sauces  they aren t the hottest around  you can find hotter sauces made from the same pepper    but whether you taste the pepper is a different story  what i ve noticed with this brand of sauce is that you can actually taste the pepper  now to this particular sauce    i tried dabs of this sauce on omlets or pizza with no particular note or notice  it seemed no hotter than any other habanero based sauce i ve had in the past  all hype   right one day i decided to use it for a dipping sauce for french fries    not such a good idea  this sauce is fine in small amounts  you get a good dose of the taste of the pepper  but try to use it like a habanero sauce is a mistake    it s painful  slow  constant burn really sneaks up on you  just when you think it is not that bad    it s too late  have respect for the naga jolokia  now i know why they call it the ghost chili,1,0

4022,this is the first loaf of gf bread i ve attempted to bake  i followed the instructions to the letter and it was better than expected  i did have a problem with a large air pocket at the center bottom of the loaf  causing an implosion when i removed it from the oven  i think the rise time may have been too long  so i will half it if i make this one again  the taste is good  the texture smooth and elastic  slightly like egg bread  it was moist  not crumbly   it s a little beany  but if you aren t expecting it to taste like white wheat bread  then it s fine  i wouldn t put jam on it  but i think it would do well for french toast or for a sandwich with hearty robust fillings  i ve been eating yummy artisan wheat breads all my life until i was forced to remove gluten from my diet  and in comparison  this wasn t awful  i give it a b   surely it could improve but it s edible and my picky 8 year old likes it  different,1,0

4023,i have purchased this at least twice  maybe 3 times   once i got the 120 count box and that lasted a long time  i am not a fan of dark chocolate  but this is not a truly dark chocolate flavor  it is not quite milk  but not bitter like dark chocolate can be  the truffles with the black wrapping are way too dark chocolate for me   so this is a nice balance between the milk chocolate in the red wrapper and the black wrapper dark lindor truffles  i have to keep a sharp eye on the price  because for a while there it went way up and i didn t buy during that time  the reviewers that complained about melting must have not received their candy carefully wrapped in a styrofoam box  with little ice packs in the box  by the time mine got here on a very hot day  the packs were melted  but the chocolate was fine  love the convenience and quantity  best chocolate for  a reasonable price,1,0
3987,nice glass jar and i love the pattern all over it  the lid is plastic  but screws on for a good seal  i didn t give it 5 stars because i think the lid s fit could be better  but around our house  trates don t stay long enough to get stale  0 i wouldn t go any taller than this size  three sizes are availabe  this is thee middle one  though  i am thinking of getting the smaller size as well  nice jar,1,0
4095,really liked the coffee  but most providers sell three boxes of coffee for less than this one box   seems overpriced to me  good coffee  but overpriced,1,0
4097,this conditioner definitely adds volume to my hair which is a huge plus for me   no more flat hair the smell is decent   certainly not something to rave about it but it s not bad either   i ve had some products from this brand that the smell was just downright awful   this isn t one of those it s great with tangles too which is great for my 11 year old daughters hair   brushing the tangles out can be very challenging at times but this conditioner really helps out there i would recommend this product  definitely adds volume   ,1,0
4171,this  tila   lindenflower tea is the strongest i have tried the content gets this gooey effect when it s wet i e  there is no way to suck it dry after infusion  but you re not supposed to do that anyways    otherwise it has the medicinal properties i was looking for  it is great before going to sleep  strongest tilia tea,1,0
4170,while amazingly nutritious  this powder does taste like a fresh bale of alfalfa hay smells   slightly sweet and like a barn  i found just mixing it with water  that it was pretty hard to get down unless diluted heavily and ice cold  however  i was not used to drinking wheat grass juice or any other grass based drinks  but     once i mixed it in with a simple smoothie of banana  ice  greek yogurt and raw honey  it was very tasty  the fruit masks the grassy taste  it would probably do well mixed in with a green machine juicing recipe or another favorite recipe for your juicer with lemon juice and ginger to cut the grassy taste  i would buy it again     tastes like a hay bale  but that s okay   ,1,0
4168,my goodness  we have a hyper dog   he digs  chews on the sprinkler heads  and has shredded the wood fence   chemical deterrents have had poor success  so it was time for an electric fence   we are impressed with this product   our dog grimaced when he was first shocked and has shown care to avoid those areas   he did not yelp and has suffered no ill effects   thank you for the help  works well,1,0
4167,xylitol is fantastic for dental health this gum is great because it doesn t contain any of the less than ideal additives  like aspartame nutrasweet  saccharin  sorbitol  mannitol  artificial flavors  artificial colors  etc   that make most other gums and mints  even those with xylitol as an ingredient  problematic the flavor is nice  the texture is fine  and it lasts for at least 15 minutes  which is all i want it to do  note that this gum is manufactured in finland and the xylitol is sourced from birch wood  also  it s non gmo  not genetically modified    which is not the case with some other brands of xylitol products  which source their xylitol from china and or from corn i wish that this gum could be purchased in smaller amounts  because the price for this company s giant containers packs is quite a lot of money to spend on something you ve never tried before   i m sure more people would give them a try if they packaged this in one 30 piece  portable little cardboard box  and sold it as an  add on  product at amazon for 2 dollars or something  just so folks could try it out  great,1,0
4165,you have to get use to eating nothing    this is what this is like they smell and taste like the ocean  i like the sesame seed much better while i was at whole foods yesterday these were 3 for  5 00i bought 15pks they don t spoil  i mix them with nuts  yummmm  not bad,1,0
4164,i have been buying the gold label virgin coconut oil from tropical traditions for years   i usually buy 1 gallon bucket at a time   i transfer some to wide mouth mason jar from the plastic bucket   i try to avoid plastic  but buying it in quart glass jars cost 2x more   i was out and getting ready to order another bucket   i am glad i decided to read some reviews on other coconut oils on amazon   based on reviews for this oil  single jar  but i bought 12 pack  i decided to try it   i love dr  bronner s soaps  so why not buy this oil   i know prices change on amazon   i bought this set for  104  i calculated the cost to compare it to tropical traditions  1 gallon bucket on sale for  75 7 37 shipping snail mail  82 37  and this one 14 oz x12  1 3125 gallon which boils down to  72 24 per gallon    so it turned out to be cheaper and in convenient glass jars  so i don t have to transfer the oil from bucket to jar   another plus   it smells better than tropical traditions   i know tt can vary in taste and smell from batch to batch  and mine might have been older since i was on my last 1 2 quart   i just loved the fresh smell of dr b s coconut oil  taste matched the wonderful coconutty aroma   it might help with taste and smell retention by having it in separate jars that don t get open until use  not like the bucket that i open once or twice a month to refill my more convenient container    another thing i love about this oil is that it comes in standard jars that have an opening to fit canning lids   i can my own produce and my town doesn t recycle glass   i can reuse these jars myself or give to friends who can their produce   local beekeepers also welcome them to put their honey   they can use standard canning lids   the only bad thing i have to say about this oil is not on the product itself but the company that sold it to me  poor packaging or maybe poor delivery on ups part    some people think it doesn t belong in the review of the product  some think customer service is part of it  so i m including it as well   the jars weren t packed well and 4 lids got crushed and oil leaked   glass wasn t broken  luckily    company has a very good customer service and offered me a choice   refund or replacement of the damaged jars   i m happy and give this product 5 stars  love the smell and taste and price,1,0
4163,i like to drink and i like to make drinks so much that i recently graduated from bartending school for the sole reason of makig better drinks at home   i use the q brand ginger ale and tonic so i thought i would give the kola a try   it did not disappoint it has so much flavor that even though it is kola flavor it is not fair to compare it to coke or pepsi the q brand has so much taste and natural flavor   it is slightly more tart than a typical cola but that is not a bad thing   now as far as mixing it with a bourbon  i use it with makers mark or woodford  or rum  appleton estate  the drinks are considerbly better with the q product   if you are going to pay top dollar for top shelf liqour than dont be cheap on the mix and get the q kola you will not be disappointed and your friends will be impressed with the taste of a simple drink like bourbon and cola and how different it tastes with the q product  top shelf mix for top shelf liquor,1,0
4172,the 2 pound plastic bag came inside a us postal bag that was secured with an extra length of fiberglass reinforced tape strip over the sealing flap  very considerate packaging for mailing i would have given 5 stars if the plastic bag from the manufacturer was more heavy duty  when trying to open the resealable package by the strips above the seal  the plastic strips tore off  when opening the bag  pull the formed seals open by grasping below the strip where the seeds are held  then the bag might open without tearing off tabs  that s how i open the bag now that the upper flaps are gone i poured half the bag into an empty swanson 1 lb bag from a previous order that is heavier packaging the seeds themselves are large and have a very good taste  raw unsalted shelled pumpkin seeds,1,0
4161,i wanted to solely breastfeed but was unable to keep up and had to supplement formula   i chose similac because they are a very reputable company and i had a ton of it from the hospital   we have used both the powder and ready made and he likes both   he got a little constipated at the beginning but has been on it now for 5 months and no problems   i read some other reviews about sucrose   well  sucrose is just sugar and all formula has sugar in it   other companies just label it differently and since ths one is organic it has to contain a pure sugar   as far as the hexane goes  i did my research  all formulas except one  babys only  use the hexane method   babys only contains brown rice syrup that has been shown to have high levels of arsenic  uh  no thanks   also similac has been tested and found to have no hexane present in the product   overall my baby is healthy and smart so i am very happy with this formula  love this formula ,1,0
4159,another reviewer said that the vendor had switched this product out for a lower quality one  i decided to order it anyway  since the price was so low i figured i wasn t risking much  in my case  at least  the product i received was the product advertised  it is definitely one of the better matchas available on amazon  and for less than half the price it s a pretty good deal  i will order this again   but if the vendor pulls the bait and switch on me i will definitely edit this review  good quality for the price,1,0
4158,my dogs jumped on these  i ve purchased the souper bones for years  they ve loved the soupers but deviated with the hope of providing at least a small change for them  the reaction was positive  to say the least  maybe it s the texture but my chessie was very happy  he mauled his on the first day  an unusual reaction for him  it s still usable  it just bears thorough  chessie marks   my gsd loves his too i ve not given any dog a rawhide chew for many  many years  some may report no problems but a lab chewed off the end of a rawhide chew  i lost him due to that darn thing  good luck to you if you furnish those to your dogs  i sincerely hope that you never face the same tragedy  oh yeah  only nylabone chews for my guys  i love them too much to see them foolishly lost  nylabone dura chew  chicken,1,0
4157,i am always looking for wild alaskan or sockeye canned salmon  i eat a lot of fresh and frozen wild salmon  but sometimes i just don t have time to prepare a meal from scratch  so i depend on healthy canned products to get me through i have switched brands a few times recently  due to brands changing their  recipe   and due to relocating  i decided to try this  and was excited that the taste is actually pretty okay for the type of fish  the sockeye of this brand has a stronger flavor  and this wild alaskan is a little more bland overall  i m happy with this product  and will continue to purchase it until they make it worse  or raise the price to the point that i can t afford it anymore i gave it four stars because it s not immediately obvious if the can is bpa free  and i gave up contacting producers a long time ago as the answer was always yes  i m over looking the bpa aspect of it  since it s so hard to find boneless  skinless  wild alaskan salmon that tastes descent  descent taste  price is manageable,1,0
4156,i liked the idea of an organic sweetener  so i was prepared to make wholesome sweeteners organic stevia my preferred product  but after trying it for a month  i think i shall stay with my old favorite  splenda   stevia is  ok   but i found it to be not as sweet  when used in some instances   my breakfast cheerios needed at least two packets  and still didn t seem to pack the sweet flavor   plus i found the individual packets rather difficult to open sometimes   they are kind of a foil plastic type packet  and occasionally they fight back when i try to open them   plus sometimes the product is lumpy inside  despite the packaging   if you are truly wary of side effects of other sweeteners  than this should work for you   but i m not going to give up my old brand  it s ok  but not my favorite artificial sweetener ,1,0
4155,ok  while i didn t like this one as well as davidson s other peach offerings  i did think it was decent  and totally drinkable   and this is coming from someone who doesn t really like tea  but is trying to develop a taste for it the overall taste of this tea is a bitterness slightly spiced   i didn t really taste the peach at all  but that was ok   it was a good kind of bitterness  one that combined with the actual heat of the drink warmed you up and it was very calming   the spices were hard to identify if you don t look at the package  but they reminded me of winter and fall  and getting ready to settle into the harvest   the same kind of spices you would find in a cookie   although the clove did really stand out the ingredients are good in this tea   organic black tea  organic orange peel  organic cinnamon and organic cloves with some natural flavor   so almost everything was organic  which i wasn t expecting  but was pleasantly surprised by   i do have to say the orange peel surprised me  i would have never guessed it was in there   but i was a little disappointed peach wasn t actually listed  which is probably why i didn t taste it   and the one teabag was sufficient enough for a large mug of tea after steeping for several minutes   i added no sweetener to the tea either a nice tea by davidson s but not my favorite   still  the ingredients alone make it worth getting review by m  reynard 2012 davidson s spiced peach tea,1,0

4160,these were a great quick snack that did not raise my blood sugar level and you could sprinkle a variety of seasons to your taste preferences   however  i chose to use the auto ship  because of new health issues  i am unable to eat these anymore   however because lowrey s does not give you any option or information on how to cancel an order  i am forced to waste money buying these and having to toss them   i hate to write this here  but maybe if they read it  they ll add the contact information   thank you  lowrey s microwavable pork rinds,1,0

4178,i don t know what some of the negative reviewers are used to drinking  i m guessing major name brands with hfcs as the main ingredient we bought this at a local organic store  and loved it  we also love the new century cola by blue sky  it tastes like real root beer  it does not have a heavy licorice taste  nor does it taste like cough syrup  maybe they reformulated the recipe since the negative reviews were posted  but i also think that if someone is used to commercial soda by major manufacturers  which tastes nothing like real root bear  cream soda or ginger ale  then they will not like this if you aren t sure about don t buy the 24 pack  find it locally  try it  then buy it in bulk  ignore the poor reviews,1,0
4199,of course you wouldn t usually hear people complain their cocaine isn t cut  but  cut  in the case of cocaine energy drink is supposed to be the one that didn t burn  i didn t personally care as it was still drinkable and i just got the drink to try it and since these ones are individual instead of a 12 24 pack or whatever  not sure if it was a mistake that it wasn t the cut one  or if they re just selling the regulars  but that might be relevant to people who are specifically seeking the cut version  not cut,1,0

4196,let me  begin by saying  i am not particularly adventurous in the candy aisle  i don t pick sweets up to try on a whim  because  let s face it   whether or not i like it  it s probably been sitting either in a box or on a shelf since the stone age  but when my roommate bought some at the 99 cent store  yes  we poor people do shop there  and offered me one  i took a bite to be polite  and ended up eating the entire thing and a second one to boot these sesame bars are crunchy  sweet  and full of delicious sesame flavor  as someone who likes to catch and eat all the runaway toasted sesame seeds from her bagel  i could not get enough of these  the next time i passed the store  i ran in and used pocket change to buy six more  and have been stashing them like a squirrel i m a little disappointed at the cost of this product  really  a pack of 36 is  27   but maybe i m just being silly and am disappointed i can t stock more for my twice weekly indulgence without going all the way to the store  phooey  i m an official addict,1,0

4191,i have been clean and sober almost 23 yrs  and never got into energy drinks but the local wal mart was giving free samples  small cups so i took one  i felt kind of tired but after drinking just a small cup  felt  great  body and mind so  i bought a 3 pack  4 88  they only have grape and i ve never liked grape  anything but it was o k  but kind of expensive for 3 drinks but i figured if that tiny cup made me feel   that  good  each tube would last me a while   i gave 4 stars because in my experience  when it gets too  hot   the tube   on two occasions  i put one in my pocket  pulled it out later to pour into a cold bottle of water and even though i poured some of the water out of the bottle  it fizzed up and out and made a mess  i think the good stuff gets lost when this happens  has only happened when it was hot and i did not feel anything after  no zipp  like it all came out   i am going to try just drinking the amount i drank in the  sample cup  maybe drinking the whole tube  is too much for me becasue i noticed i get almost wired and that s something i don t want to be  any more  just feel  good  first energy drink i ve tried,1,0

4185,kellogg has a habit of putting objectionable ingredients into things it produces  especially when they have a kosher or vegetarian designation like worthington and loma linda  both kellogg products  in this case the packing broth has two interesting chemicals that i dare not name  so i emptied the broth down the drain and repeatedly filled the can with water to dilute the stuff  so  with luck  the concentration of broth ingredients has been reduced maybe tenfold  ah yes  the  skallops  could be called worthington  white meat   and they taste good with ketchup on pita bread from the parthenon amazon storefront so  the question is whether kellogg does these things as a cheaper alternative to having their own testing program for these chemicals  i mean  is it cheaper to sell this stuff as  food  to minority clients and deal with potential lawsuits than to run an fda approved testing program  inquiring minds want to know  silly people at kellogg,1,0
4184,i don t know what some of the negative reviewers are used to drinking  i m guessing major name brands with hfcs as the main ingredient we bought this at a local organic store  and loved it  we also love the root bear encore by blue sky  it tastes like real cola did  back in the days before p and cc adulterated it with chemicals and flavor enhancers  it does not have a heavy after taste  nor does it taste like cough syrup  maybe they reformulated the recipe since the negative reviews were posted  but i also think that if someone is used to commercial soda by major manufacturers  which tastes nothing like real cola  root bear  cream soda or ginger ale  then they will not like this if you aren t sure about it  don t buy the 24 pack  find it locally  try it  then buy it in bulk  and if you are not used to a chemical free  mainly organic  diet  stay away  your tastebuds are skewed to crave things like hfcs and this definitely will affect your palate  not for people who like hfcs and  fake  cola,1,0

4110,i was extremely excited about receiving this set   once received  the visual aspect of it was wonderful  however  i can t fully say the same thing about every last syrup  lets start with the eggnog  this was probably my favorite because it truly tasted like eggnog  alcohol and all  and the smell was dead on  nutmeg  exactly what it should smell like  cinnamon  this one reminded me of red hot candies which isn t bad but i have yet to try it in my coffee  pumpkin spice  one word  potpourri  i definitely did not like this one   yes  it is called  pumpkin spice   but this is not what i expected   it s waaaaaay too spicy    it tasted like tons of spices added onto the cinnamon   it s just a no  chai  this one smelled like bubblegum and chai tea spice   the scent was somewhat nauseating to me   didn t like it at all   finally gingerbread   this one was okay  but not a true keeper   there was too much ginger in it to fully call it gingerbread   should have been called candied ginger instead so all in all  i would not re purchase this set again   i really do not like the pumpkin spice  chai nor the gingerbread although the bottles were nice                                                                                                                                 update   it was only a few days after posting the review on this particular product  set  and my dislike about some of the flavors  that i received a phone call voicemail from paul barsoumian himself about my review   quite frankly  i was a bit shocked due to never experiencing customer service like that before   i was debating on returning this set and just purchasing the holiday 3 set  peppermint  eggnog  gingerbread i think  since i was not too fond of the gingerbread  chai or pumpkin spice   he very graciously took the time out to call me and provide a bit more on their products and even how to use them  especially the trio that i did not take to right away   when using the syrups  i did know that since they were more concentrated than other syrups like torani  davinci  etc and less sugary but what i didn t quite grasp was that you really do not need so much   the two times that i used the gingerbread syrup  i would put a full pump into my drink  coffee  and it was soooo overwhelming that i literally dumped it into the sink   however  when talking to mr  barsoumian  he informed me that i only needed half a pump if that   i will say that i have yet to retry it in coffee  but i do like to add a touch to tea for a hint of gingery flavor  i will try it soon though even with the pumpkin spice and my true dislike for that flavor   i am starting to wonder if my pre exposure to other  pumpkin spice  syrups have ruined my taste buds with their artificial nature   i ll admit  when i purchased this set  that was one of the main reasons why i chose it   pumpkin spice just screamed my name   but when tasting it  my expectations were shot   i do not blame amoretti for this because when i actually think about it  this is what pumpkin spice should taste like   it taste like autumn if that is even possible  yet without the pumpkin which is fine because the name isn t pumpkin pie spice  just pumpkin spice after informing me of the usages of the syrups and how much to use  paul sent me a few samples of other products  like the new pumpkin pie  crema di tiramisu and a few other products    i honestly thought that when he said  samples  he meant miniature versions of the original  but apparently these were the original size  regardless  each flavor that i received was absolutely delicious   i will say that the pumpkin pie was definitely what i was looking for   and the crema di tiramisu was just wow   it was like liquid tiramisu   the espresso flavor blends with the actual espresso in a coffee drink but it somewhat mellows it out leaving the true flavor of tiramisu   i d just like to restate that amoretti has by far  the best customer service that i have ever came across   i definitely plan on trying more flavors from this company and building my ever growing collection of amoretti syrups  i already have 14   i have changed my ratings to 4 5 stars rather than 3 5   this is not due to a hate for the flavors  but i just have not found my preference for what to put them in yet  have not been given the time   but even the ones that i do not care for as much  i have seen that others do like them   they are great  only so so  good  ,1,0
4106,honestly who doesn t love muddy buddies  i purchased these direct from amazon and received them in their normal condition  they weren t melted or scrunched  my daughter ate them just as fast as she does the ones we buy at the store except they were half the cost    good buy  puppy chow ,1,0
4105,i have come to not expect much from dog toys  but friends recommended this after hearing me complain that my little boxer mix destroys her toys in about 5 min after we buy  including the invincible ones  this one has lasted at least one month  warning it does get sharp  and looks a little perverse  amazing,1,0
4104,i love this stuff  hence the 5 star review  however the last shipment i received  early august 2012  seems a bit off  way more hot and spicy then normal  which is not necessarily a bad thing  and extra salty  has anybody else experienced this  maybe i just got an off batch  i hope so because this is one of my very favorite convenience foods  what happened ,1,0
4103,i found this conditioner to be really thick  much like their shampoos  so i felt like i could get away with using less  it seemed to work fine  i put some on my palm  rubbed it in while in the shower and waited a few minutes  it rinsed clean and fairly easily  no left over residue  and left my hair smelling very fresh  i didn t see much difference in the way my hair acted in humid weather and such  because my hair has a mind of its own and can only be tamed by treseme mousse  other hair products are child s play for my locks  which just laugh at my feeble attempts to break their spirit  and since my mane is very curly and thick  your millage may vary  fresh smelling conditioner,1,0
4102,what can i say  tastes great  easy to add to a water bottle  not too sweet  not too bland  just right  tastes fantastic,1,0

4108,these are pretty good the cans are well filled with product  and not too much water   the cans have a pull top which is easy to open the artichokes do appear to be young  smaller ones and  rather surprisingly  the gentle aromas and flavor complexities of that still comes across  even in the canned product   they all have an even  healthy color without bruising or other blemishes   while it s true that all canned foods are going to taste  canned   these are much less noticeable in that regard than any other artichokes packed in water that i ve purchased   the flavor is good  as is the texture   they are quite tender  not mushy  but you can easily smoosh them for puree or bruschetta or what you will they are quartered pieces  easy to use as is or chop as desired   i have had to remove what i consider to be some tough bits and outer leaves   maybe these weren t bad enough to bother other people   i ve had much worse from canned artichokes they do not lend a canned metallic flavor to other ingredients  nor are they too salty  oily  vinegary  bitter  stale  or any of the other unpleasant flavors that one often gets with canned artichokes   cooked as an addition to other dishes they contribute appealingly  some tough bits  but tasty  not mushy  fresh taste,1,0
4149,i am ordering more  this coffee so much better then the pods you buy at the store  no plastic after taste  good coffee,1,0

4147,i love this flour   it has a great texture and is perfect for my gluten free and low carb needs   i would highly recommend that you buy this flour   but only in the 5 lb size i love it and use it so much that i thought i d try to be more economical and buy the 25 lb box direct from honeyville s site   i was so excited to start baking that i opened it up the second i got in the door   i found it was packed in an unsealed blue garbage bag inside of a cardboard box  and was completely infested with ants   yuck   i m extremely cheap  but having bugs in my baking supplies completely grossed me out   i don t see how they would keep this from happening again in the future  given the way that they pack the bulk boxes   on honeyville s site you can get a smaller discount for buying at least six 5 lb bags  but to me it s worth it to know that i m getting a safe food product  buy the 5 lb bag  not 25 lb box ,1,0
4146,i could not be more impressed with this product  it seriously tastes and looks just like a sloppy joe  you will not be disappointed  very convincing veg sloppy joe  ,1,0
4145,i feel good when i drink that herbal coffee i m not getting nervous like when i drink real coffee it is good for every time of the day even the evening the taste is like real coffee but it smells weird i like the smell of the coffee beans and i really miss it that s why i m giving it 4 stars because of the smell tastes like real coffee but i don t like the smell,1,0

4142,trust me  coconut water tastes different  not all the coconut waters tastes the same i am from india and we have a coconut tree in our front porch   have been drinking coconut water almost every since i was born    while there is a wide variation of the taste of coconut water within india  i had a shock when i tasted coconut water in singapore   it was something out of the world  it was much sweeter than what we get in india and had a unique flavor to it   eversince then i wanted to find out what variety do they cultivate in singapore thailand and wanted to get them to india and introduce them to local farmers   which i have never been able to do  but hopefully will do it one day   in the us   coconut water is pretty expensive and buy them once in a way   tried zicco  c2o and a couple of other brands my conclusion is that c2o coconut water is really the best in terms of taste and zicco is the worst   the only good thing about zicco is the packaging   the best coconut water around,1,0
4140,where do they get these prices you can get this at your local grocery for 2 to 3 dollars this is completely insane  where do they get these prices ,1,0
4139,i think i taste more of the mango then the peach but over all i like the vita coco water with flavors then just by itself  i am not in the food science world but i think coconut water is made by taking the coconut milk and separating the cream  solids from the water part   what is left is a strong coconut flavored past that is sent somewhere else and coconut water that still has health effects and a very slight coconut flavor   it also has some weight  or thickness that is heaver then what normal water would be  it reminds me of an egg white viscosity   drink it colder the better i say because when warm urp  hmm ok,1,0
4123,i really enjoy this oil  it s great for cooking and has many other uses as well  what i didn t like was the new upgraded opaque white jar that nutiva now uses for the coconut oil  i have found that when coconut oil liquefies in hot weather some of the oil seeps through the bottom of the jar  i think it might be due to the process in which they make their new opaque plastic jars  there is a line in the middle where the two parts of plastic where joined together or where the plastic was molded and separated from the mold   at the bottom of the jar the oil leaks through this mold line  in summer temperatures i have found some residual oil left at the bottom of the surface where i leave the jar  this was not a problem with the previous jars  nutiva should address this problem right away  coconut oil can seep past the new opaque white plastic jar ,1,0
4138,i bought a 20 pack bundle of this noodle  i make it the way i usually do to a normal instant noodle and hated its taste  but wait  it was not until the last couple packs when i realized the correct way to make these noodles  and they are delicious if you make it the right way notice that it is called chajiang noodle  which means it s not noodle in a soup the right way to make the noodle is  you put the noodle in a bowl  pour in boiling water and wait  don t put in the seasoning package yet  when the noodle is ready  pour out the water  and then add the pack of seasoning  the remaining moisture on the noodle will turn the powder into a thick sauce  and you mix well and serve  it s the same way you make low mein if you know what i am talking about so  this is actually good tasting noodles if you read the instructions on the package and do it correctly  sadly  sometimes we are like  i feed on instant noodles since i was 5 and i know how to make them   and we don t read the instructions   i hope you can try the method i mentioned above and enjoy it     if you think it taste bad you are probably not preparing it in the right way,1,0
4134,soups  baking breads etc   if i am baking something where the taste of pumpkin is not the main event  then i will use a less expensive brand   but  when i really want the taste of pumpkin to be outstanding  then this is the one i use  my favorite for    ,1,0
4131,this mackerel tastes good  it is water with salt inside  the cans state that this a product of china  it is a  chicken of the sea  product though  so i thought it is worth trying  i read that the fish are hand packed into the cans after having machines gut and and remove the heads and tails of the fish  i have bought pink salmon from this same brand  usa salmon  which i like too  mackerel in water with salt  tastes good  product of china ,1,0
4130,we purchased 3 for our hot dog kitchen  we have used them 5 days a week for a year  they get washed and scrubbed every evening  so far no problems with the outer shell  as experienced by another reeviewer they keep the coffee drinkably hot for 7 hours  i do preheat each carafe by pouring boilng water into each  before i pour in the coffee all in all we like these thermal carafes   i generally do give 5 stars  as most things could be improved   designers and manufqacturers should not be allowed to be complacent  bunn 32125 0000 thermal carafe,1,0

4125,the good news is that this caffeine infused death syrup works   it ll keep you up all night  every night  for the rest of what s left of your meager life  the taste is weird  but not terrible  extremely tart  extremely sweet  and the aftertaste of burning tooth enamel is actually relatively pleasant  the bad news is that if you drink this  even once  your internal organs will prolapse and or solidify  not necessarily in any specific order overall  recommended  so good i can barely sit still ,1,0
4136,the first ones i got there was something wrong with the cans and they were almost impossible to open with the new can opener from amazon but i tried them again and these are great and open more easily  i like it,1,0
3986,these are some pretty tasty sardines  very tender and not too salty  a bit too soft and bland for my taste  but that s just my taste  nice for doctoring up with your own seasonings  a splash of extra virgin olive oil and a shake of hot sauce   yum      it s also great to know that crown prince is now using bpa free cans on their brislings unfortunately  amazon seems to be shipping out old stock  and none of the boxes i received had the bpa free sticker  i ended up calling crown prince  and they confirmed that the cans without the sticker are not bpa free when i contacted amazon about it  they said they could replace the product  but not confirm whether it was the right product or not  alas  the replacement box was not bpa free either  fortunately  they were kind enough to refund my money  but i would have preferred they just ship me the product that they are advertising on this page hopefully amazon will update their stock  because this is a great price  for those not concerned about bpa  i would recommend this product as an affordable source of some decent brislings  good product  not bpa free  old stock  ,1,0
3984,i m pretty disappointed with the flavor of this syrup  it taste nothing like pumpkin spice at all  i went off other reviews and decided to take a chance  but wish i hadn t  it should be called  cinnamon spice  because it taste identical to a red hot candy  it s not extremely terrible  just do not order this if you expect it to taste like pumpkin   it doesn t   don t get me wrong  it s great quality  just no pumpkin taste in my opinion           updated    extremely impressed with amoretti s customer service  paul quickly did what he could to make sure i was satisfied  anxious to try other amoretti products  will updated once i try those          updated again    i m updating again  after having paul explain to me that a little goes along way with this product i tried the syrup again and i m very please  now  don t get me wrong   there s no pumpkin flavor to it at all  but its the best quality syrup i ve ever had and it s great in hot drinks  i suggest to the company to take pumpkin off the label and just call it  spice   dissappointed updated   ,1,0
3983,i like the big   fresh peanuts in the mix   chocolate pieces in the mix create the surprise when munching the  healthy  snack   not too salty for me   however  i can hardly see any cranberries  mostly raisins   that is the reason for 4 stars  not five btw  i paid  19 30 from amazon marketplace  good snack,1,0

3835,first off  i normally don t buy bottled water  so i m not an expert on the taste of bottled water   i do  however  buy a lot of sports drinks for drinking while cycling and working out   i wasn t sure how to review plain ol  water  but i decided just to compare it with the water i get out of my faucet   the essentia does indeed have a better taste to it   by comparison  my tap water has a slightly bitter taste  i m guessing from chlorine or other chemicals added to purify it    essentia s water really has no taste  which is actually a good thing   i m not sure of the benefits its ph balance has for your body   the addition of electrolytes does mean this product can do more for you than plain tap water if you re working out and losing a lot of water through sweat   if you won t miss the sugary taste of a sports drink  this is a good zero calorie alternative  clean taste,1,0
3834,this is not just any kind of water   it is 1 5 l size bottle   water feels  thick  yet silky to swallow   apparently it is infused by electrolytes and has ph factor of 9 5   this water bottle comes in plastic container which can be recycled  not just any kind of water,1,0

3831,the product was great  amazon s ability to watch expiration dates leaves a lot to be desired pros tasty greens awesome packaging   this is by far the easiest to use pouch baby food i ve tried  the spout in the corner just makes it so much easier to dispense by the spoonful  it stands up nicely cons   expensive   i was also shipped  by amazon  baby food that was 1  month expired   7 13 12   and it was clearly a return   my shipping box contained a box with a return label to amazon and then that contained the baby food  i used 2 of the pouches before i realized it was expired   i smell and or taste all her new food and it didn t taste unfresh or bad   expiration dates are usually overly cautious  especially with baby products  so i ve continued to use the pouches but will probably not go past the 2 month expired mark  i guess the expiration date explains why they were free in the vine program  if i d paid for these  you can bet i d be livid with amazon  tasty but expensive,1,0

3837,these casings weren t bad   i generally buy from my local butcher but they were out  so these were what i bought  to work with  they weren t too terrible   the ones from my butcher are a bit easier to handle  but  then again the ones i get from them aren t packed in a ton of salt either oh yeah speaking of the salt  make sure you really rinse these bad boys well   on the package it says soak for 30 minutes  but at 30 minutes these weren t ready  i let soak an hour in tepid water  changing the water twice   the runs are quite long  which i appreciated   the day i used them i made 10lbs of chicken sausage fyi  for those who use collagen  i started out on collagen because it was just easier to work with   i gradually moved to natural because of the taste  they do taste better after cooking   so while i did have to learn to use a more delicate hand with natural  for me it was worth learning   so there s a tradeoff that each cook has to decide on and out of all the sausage i made  i only had 2 major breaches   in my book  thats not exactly terrible  because shit happens   i would buy these again in a heartbeat  great casings to work with,1,0

3853,i bought this to eat as a birthday treat  i am undergoing the  gluten challenge  pending celiac diagnosis but did not want to be sick on my birthday so i skipped a day of eating gluten foods  after the tests are performed i am forced to be gluten free for life anyway  i am confirmed gluten intolerant whether or not it is full on celiac disease   this macaroni surprised me  i had the expectation that gluten free food wouldn t really taste like food at all  the al dente texture of the pasta was awesome  i had expected it to be even mushier than regular macaroni sometimes gets and it wasn t at all  the cheese sauce was just as good as the regular annie s  my fav    the only thing about it i don t like is that the rice noodles don t have much flavor of their own at all and they stick together a bit worse than wheat pasta does  but it is what it is  i knew it wouldn t have that yummy wheat taste but it was still a little disappointing  i gave it four stars because yes  i ll eat it again  but it needs a little something extra in the cheese packet to counter the blandness of rice noodles  surprisingly good,1,0
3855,no  high fructose  corn syrup  artificial preservatives  or any of the other crap that american food companies customarily put into their product  just water  elderflowers  sugar  and citric acid  a natural preservative   it tastes like grandma s back in austria  i don t think there is another product in the us that is comparable  tastes like home made,1,0
3878,i get very frustrated trying to find mayo that isn t made with lots of canola or soy oil   i also dislike those mayos which have a sweet flavor   i was happy with this one   actually i think it seems close to home made for a mass market product   it has a rich  true mayo taste such that you don t need to use much of it to get the flavor   it doesn t taste or look chemical riddled   i will buy this product again  good  not too sweet  more traditional type,1,0

3876,i have read in other reviews that the variety was not great  i did not have that problem  i did not receive equal amounts of each cereal  but it was very close  i received 6 cocoa krispies and 11 frosted flakes  that is the smallest and the largest number of one variety   the rest were fairly evenly distributed   the packaging is convenient  there are only two of us in the house and we do not eat cereal regularly  so boxes of cereal end up going stale and being thrown out   with the single serve cups we can have cereal when we want and not worry about wasting half of a box   i recommend this product to anyone who likes the types of cereal in the variety that is looking for something quick and convenient  good variety,1,0

3862,i was concerned about not having a little pouch or something to put these in to condense   no need they come with velcro wrap ups   i couldn t tell that by the pictures   i hate the idea of two separate things to keep up with or having to stuff one item into another smaller one   ugh   i will definitely be getting more of these when i need bags   the fabric is tough  they are large and sturdy as well   they are just what i needed  love these bags and love not needing a pouch ,1,0

3859,this dog toy has been a huge hit at my house  i just added a bulldog puppy to my family and if he is awake his teeth are constantly seeking something to sink into  this toy is hard enough to hold up but not so hard he loses interest  the irregular shapes are great for giving him multiple chew spots on this toy  this dinosaur has even brought out the puppy in my 8yr old mix that was never big on chew toys can t go wrong with this one  my dogs love this chew toy ,1,0

3857,after a little bit of research  i learned that magnesium plays a crucial role in the regulation of the heart  after being on medication for some time for unpleasant heart palpitations  which never worked too well   i decided to give this supplement a try  in about 2 months  the palpitations were completely gone  and i don t have to take that horrible drug anymore  this stuff is awesome  this was about a year ago  i have come to realize that doctors know nothing about caring for the human body and know very little about real nutrition  your just a customer to them  they make their money by prescribing dangerous drugs that only mask symptoms but don t correct the problem at its source  magnesium is so important for the body   you cannot go wrong with this supplement  most people are deficient in this important mineral because the land is so devoid of important minerals these days  so it s very hard to get from food alone  this is the best magnesium supplement on the market  don t take those cheap magnesium pills you can get at any store  most of them don t get absorbed by the body and act only as a laxative  magnesium citrate  of which this product is  gets assimilated easily  don t be surprised if other problems your having begin to clear up as well  magnesium deficiency can cause a lot of problems  read the book  the magnesium miracle  for more info peace  helps with heart palpitations,1,0

3827,i bring my dog to petsmart daycamp twice a week and was told by the staff that she loves to play with this particular toy during camp   so i bought one for her to play with here at home   that was yesterday  and she has barely touched her other toys since she received this   she is a powerful chewer  despite being only 21 lbs  and she has already done a bit of damage to the ends  but nothing that would require my taking it away one thing i noticed  is that this toy is made in china while other nylabone toys say   made in usa    well  either way  i will keep this one until she destroys it  but i think i will take it away from her when i m not around   i don t want her playing with this one unsupervised nylabone is great  my dog always has to have at least one or two around at all times  my dog loves it ,1,0

3800,i noticed that a lot of people have commented that the bars they received were stale and old fortunately i did not have that problem and the case i received has an expiration date of march  2013  i purchased them in august 2012  as to taste  its such a subjective thing and i d advise anyone to try something from their local grocer before buying it by the case on amazon   that said  if you like this product  you too are probably dismayed that it has become hard to find at your local grocer  and excited to find it on amazon in my opinion  these are better bars than nature s valley granola bars   that is not a knock on nature s valley bars though   their bars are excellent too  especially the peanut butter flavor   i just prefer the taste of these for my individual tastes   the fact that they are  all natural  only helps  love these bars ,1,0

3797,i gave this whitefish roe 4 stars because of the great quality of the product and the free next day shipping   it arrived a day early and ice cold   however  i don t like this roe   nothing against the company or the actual roe    it s just my preference   it doesn t give that  pop  in the mouth that i love with caviar   what a shame because it tastes great   mild and not too salty at all    but the mouth feel and texture are a turn off   for  27 dollars and free prime shipping  it was worth the try but it really feels like i m trying to chew tiny glass beads   at least my cat loves it so it isn t a total waste  i didn  t understand that  crunchy texture  actually meant  hard  like eating sand ,1,0
3794,you cat owners out there know that cats can be fussy about their food  so i want to tell you that all four of my cats clean their plates when this product is served  now it is only fair to say that my cats are not show cats  but they do have discriminating tastes   this friskies tm  product passes their smell test   thanks  amazon  for keeping these products available  my cats love this product,1,0

3791,you d think all the rotten reviews on here would turn me away from the peanut butter   i thought it looked like peanut butter   kind of smells like peanut butter  too   i dipped my knife in to taste it and was prepared for all kinds of bad      but it s really good it doesn t stick to the roof of your mouth       it s not thick like peanut butter  but spreadable  a little sweeter than the full calorie versions i m used to i tried it on it s own  without jam or crackers and i could eat a pb j with no problems thank you walden farms    i m gonna save 1 000 calories this month with your help  there must be something wrong with me   ,1,0
3787,this candy was amazing growing up  after they added the caramel it was still good but i would cut the caramel off the top so i could get back a bit of old flavor that was in the candy  if hershey went back to the original recipe i would definiely buy it from amazon  its a shame hershey keeps messing with what was once a great idea  great but better before caramel was added,1,0

3782,i received a sample of this from influenster and was pretty excited to try it because it was an interesting concept   i tasted it and thought it tasted just like banana bread   it had an odd texture and seemed a bit dry though  which is why i rated it four out of five stars  not too bad,1,0
3781,i was very disappointed when my milk arrived  soaking wet because the pkg was not securely packed and one of the boxes of milk broke open and was all over the other boxes and packing box also  i have ordered this before and it came in perfect condition  because it was packed solid in a double box  so i was short one box of milk because it spilled everywhere inside  thanks  lynnette packaging really bad,1,0
3780,i discovered this product 14 years ago  during a trip to berlin  i had never tasted them again until very recently  when i received my order  it was unbelievable  back in berlin i used to eat like  5 pounds per day  but i made this 4 pound bag last for like 3 weeks  it s just indescribable and not  i m not a fat ass  i m pretty athletic  actually  i just love gummi trolli apple rings   haribo goldb auml ren   pure bliss  the most delicious gummi oh earth,1,0
3779,i purchased these mainly to put into raw energy bars  when i received them and saw the packaging i understood what other reviews meant    leaves you wondering just how organic these are  i did a comparison taste with left over gojis i had from navitas  and i could barely tell a difference between the 2  i think for the price these are great  but am a little doubtful that they are organic  not bad for price,1,0
3788,i bought the sunflower seed thinking the ad must be a misprint   fifteen two pound bags for  9 or so    17 including shipping    when they sent me the sunflower seed   they did send just one bag   but  i wrote and said the amazon ad said 15 bags   so  they sent me 14 more bags which was the amount i was supposed to get   thus  the sunflower seed with shipping cost about  0 60 a pound   you can t beat this bargain   and the birds love the seed  so it must not be old   i  and the birds  couldn t be more pleased  sunflower seed   it really is a great deal,1,0
3826,i had searched many places locally and could not find this product   shipping costs for the item were not cheap  it is very heavy   13 6 pounds  and the containers were dented on the corners when it arrived   the item is usable and none spilled in shipment but the dented corners would prevent me from giving it as a gift or reselling it to someone else   we use this product a lot and amazon was the only place that i could find it   it arrived about a week after being ordered  good timing    i would buy this product from amazon again  act ii buttery popcorn salt   packaging could be better,1,0
3803,my son likes these fruit chews when we re on the go   it was nice to find a bigger package of them on amazon   the description of this item  however  is misleading   you get 10 ea  pack of 2 for a total of 20 packs   not 10 ea  pack of 20 for a total of 200 packs as it states   i knew when i ordered that that would be too good to be true and planned to keep it regardless   the description needs to be updated  description misleading,1,0
3805,being new to popchips  never even heard of popchips until i saw the gold box deal of the day  even with the deal of the day  the packs seemed expensive   24 pack for  12 99 with free amazon prime shipping  and the bags are only 0 8oz each  i can t imagine how they re  20 50 for a box of 24 when it was on sale for still  12 99    expensive chips  but i got them recently  and it s as advertised   they re healthy  they don t taste as good as the fried ones but you have to sacrifice some flavor for healthy chips  they still have good   tasty flavor just not as much as fried  but i knew that already before purchasing it i admit  i was a bit scared that i wouldn t like the chips and buying a box of 24 packs at once seeing as i ve never had them until now was a risk purchase  but it s a sampler so i knew that there had to be at least one flavor that i ll like out of 11 flavors  so far i ve tried salt   pepper which is gross in my opinion and the original popchips  original popchips i like  tasted like original chips like pringles original except these are way more healthier since they re popped  great sampler pack,1,0
3824,first of all  i m the type of person who wants to try everything  some of my favorite foods are what other people won t even touch  anyway  i heard about blk water a long time ago and have been wanting to try it since i found out about it  i actually found it at a local health foods store and was so excited that i bought a few bottles to try out  these bottles were stored at room temperature  but when i took my first sip  it was actually cool  i have no need to refrigerate this water because it quenches my thirst just fine when i opened my first bottle i took a sniff to see if it smelled metallic or dirty  but i could smell absolutely nothing  and i really don t know why all these reviews say there s a horrible metal aftertaste or that they d rather drink car oils  yes  this water is black  but so are a bunch of sodas  and those are completely terrible for you  i ll bet that if you took a drink of blk blindfolded you wouldn t notice any difference in the purity of the taste of this vs any other water  as for those that preach that there are no health benefits to this water  at least there are no risks  i ve seen some questions on other sites regarding the color of urine after drinking blk and i am going to be flat out honest  i can drink a few bottles of regular water and my urine will still be a pale yellow  but after just one bottle of blk  my urine is very near clear as for comparing other bottled waters  i d have to say this is the freshest water i ve tasted  other bottled waters i ve tasted have a strange chlorinated taste to it and make my mouth a little dry except for maybe fiji  but even fiji doesn t taste cool when stored at room temperature  when i was in my college class i had finished up my bottle of blk and went to refill at the water fountain that i always fill my empty cups and bottles with and that made me want to gag  after having blk  i really noticed the taste of the city s tap  it tasted strongly of metals and chlorine  usually  after having any other bottled water  i don t notice a difference when switching to tap  blk has made me realize that the city s water is contaminated with all sorts of disgusting stuff all these other reviewers who say that they d much rather sip on motor oil obviously have never drank anything this healthy and aren t used to its pure taste  the fact that this water is black should not scare you into thinking blk is worse than fuel  i m more scared of the awful chemicals in regular tap  like water  but better  love at first sip ,1,0
3822,i do love this product i don t know about how much the calorie burner aspect has worked  but i do like the energy boost on a long day my issue is not with the product but the description of the variety pack  i did get 12 cans nicely packaged and arrived on time  however not all the flavors in the description are in the pack product featurestwo cans strawberry kiwi  iced lemon tea  apple orchard blend and one can orange  green tea raspberry acai  wild berry  green tea peach mango  ginger ale  and colawhat i received2 iced lemon tea  2 orange  2 green tea acai  2 wild berry  2 sparkling orange  and 2 cola basically to summarize i did not get  strawberry kiwi  apple orchard blend  or ginger ale if the description said the flavors were random that would be fine  but with it being that specific i just expected what i paid for as i said i do like celsius  and i ll order again  i was just hoping to try the different flavors  love celsius  not all variety   ,1,0
3820,this is a nice coffee but not worth the price   not sure what all the hype is about  most lavazza  illy and other italian brands are much better tasting to me  ok coffee,1,0
3819,hard to find that old time licorice flavor anymore  i have ordered this twice and shared with friends who have ordered and shared with me  if you are a hard core black licorice fan  this is for you as you will not be disappointed  old time licorice flavor,1,0
3818,i had a hard time training my formally outside cat to this litter  so  i had to put dirt in the box also with the litter so that he would get the idea  he didn t like to much at first  however  he now likes it  the strong scent does sometimes bother my asthma works pretty well for the price ,1,0
3817,i must admit  although it is bad for the environment due to the plastic bottles  i regularly consume bottled water   i have tried many versions  and while one would think that water is water  they really do taste differently in terms of taste  i thought this water tasted good   i chose to chill mine before drinking it  and found it to be very refreshing  without any chemical or metallic taste that i was able to detect   it tasted  in short  like water   i did not think the change in ph made it taste any differently  so that is a real positive for me while i cannot speak to the accuracy of the claims of the benefits to this particular formula of water  i can say that if the water does indeed contain the additional electrolytes  this provides a good alternative to sugary high calorie sports drinks many reviewer commented that this is merely treated water from municipalities  as opposed to spring water  and therefore not worth the cost   if this were the sole source of my water intake  i would agree   i would not purchase this for the whole of my drinking and cooking water   but when looking for a bottle of water to take on a trip or throw in a backpack  or a source of electrolytes after athletic activity  or illness  i think this would fit the bit quite nicely  tasted great to me,1,0
3815,i purchased this to give the home ordering thing a try  i d never purchased frozen meat online before  so this was a new adventure  the pictures looked great  and the chicken itself looked like good cuts of meat unfortunately  i received this shipment in dry ice   but the ice had almost completely thawed  leaving the chicken inside warm to the touch  can t risk salmonella  do i contacted the seller   the seller credited my purchase back to me  and assured me that future orders would be packed in more ice to make it to california during the summer months  i am going to reorder this shipment  because even though the chicken was not able to be eaten  it looked very tasty  the cuts were generous and weighed just as much as the listing claimed  and aside from the temperature issue  the product looked just as it does in the pictures add to that some incredibly stellar customer service  and this may be an item that i purchase regularly for quite some time to come  great customer service with this order,1,0
3804,we had to experiment with this product after using it the first few times as it s more concentrated than supermarket brands  when we get that down i expect these two pounds will last a really long time  i m really starting to be product loyal to frontier natural products coop and this is the fifth item from them i ve purchased via amazon subscribe and save  everything i ve bought is at least better than what i m accustomed to if not superior  and the volume savings in incredible  again  two pounds  32 ounces  packaged in two individually sealed pouches for how much  cheap  this particular item is labeled  powdered white onion   allium cepa    non irradiated  but does not show a country of origin  i don t really care anyway for onions  expiration date is shown  best by may 2015  i m finding myself checking other frontier natural products and just buying them based on my experiences  suggestion  get a dozen ball or kerr brand preserving jars and pack these spices away for freshness   john good tasting concentrated quality bulk onion powder,1,0
3814,i ordered 15 boxes of this flour  or at least that s what i thought   the carton in which the flour was delivered sat unopened until recently  september 5  2012  and lo and behold   only 11 boxes   i would advise caution if buying from this vendor     the flour itself is great  or i should say was  because general mills for some reason stopped making it  at least as packaged in 2  boxes   buyer beware  of the vendor ,1,0
3812,if you re expecting something even remotely similar to semolina pasta  you will be disappointed   i did not have any issues with the smell   yes  they re chewy   but nothing that was totally off putting   if you re trying to cut carbs or calories and are willing to try something new  they are excellent  not a replacement for pasta  but overall very good,1,0
3811,title says it all   this is a very special treat for my dogs   it is one of the few chicken strips that do not come from chicken from china and that means everything to me   quality product for my special dogs  chicken not from china,1,0
3810,dainty little things  these are so light i could eat a whole package in one sitting  but i won t  they are not very sweet at all  but the cocoa flavor is not strong and bitter  they do start to get quite stale if you don t seal the package well  i keep them in a tightly sealed ziploc bag to keep them fresh and crispy  according to my box  four cookies have 160 calories  9 grams of total fat  and 6 grams of sugar  the ingredients are  sugar  palm oil  potato starch  rice flour  cocoa powder  soy flour  soy lecithin  guar gum  sodium bicarbonate  light and tasty,1,0

3807,very smooth and i really didnt need to stir it but i did with a plastic spoon and it did not break if that gives you an idea for the texture  no salt  sugar  oils or anything like that just raw pistacios  i like it best on bread with a little honey instead of jelly  its a product of israel and its kosher if anybody was wondering about that  i have not tried other brands so i cant compare it to them but its good  smooth  organic with no additives  and i didnt have any shell fragments like i read in some other reviews  only thing that sucks is the price  good,1,0
3806,the c2o is so much better than the 2 big advertisers in the coconut water market  only problem here is    that  17 dollar shipping is a killer  pushes the cost to  way too much  land  closest to baby coconut water out there,1,0

3882,this is a great product  my dog is infatuated with this antler chew  i picked the antler that is split down the middle because he is older and not a strong chewer  he is very happy gnawing at the exposed marrow  if your dog is a strong chewer i would recommend getting the antler that is not sawn down the middle   the intact antler would last longer  this product does not make a mess as there are no dyes   it does not splinter like bone  or get gooey like rawhide   i don t have to clean bits of goo off my dog when he is done chewing   i will buy this again  and again   excellent dog chew ,1,0
3884,very misleading  they do taste like turkey though  and from that perspective they re quite good  i really like things that taste like sticks  so they weren t for me  these don t taste like sticks at all ,1,0
3957,i am writing this in response to comments made that this is too sweet   no i haven t been to japan   the sushi i ve had has been americanized   the ginger they normally serve with sushi at lower and mid budget locations is pink dyed and tastes like remnants of a used alcohol pad   this brand doesn t have the awful alcohol taste nor artificial flavors   all the ingredients are organic  and yes  it does taste sweet   but i think that makes it palatable alone as a snack   it doesn t taste over the top sweet to me   it has 5g  sugar per 2 tbsp   i add it to my sushi as extra on the side and never notice the sweetness in contrast with the sushi flavors  i eat the ginger with the sushi   but when wanting to eat this alone i m neither overpowered by the ginger flavor nor an artificial one taking its place   i would recommend this as the only ginger product i can find that s all natural and organic  in response to those saying its too sweet ,1,0

3955,i haven t felt any difference using the essentia water after a workout   honestly the ph doesn t seem to impact the post workout thirst  but the benefits from the electrolytes are a nice addition  i m not a big fan of sports drinks so this unflavored option is welcome  if there s anything i can say that i don t like  it d be that the water feels  heavy   i generally drink a generic bottled spring water  the tap water is very hard and tastes off to me  and in comparison the essentia felt almost thick on the tongue for the green folks  the bottle itself is listed as bpa free  pet 1  but it is not biodegradable  but it will not leech into the soil either   it simply won t breakdown  the purification method the company lists on their website is microfiltration  uv sterilization and reverse osmosis  for those who aren t familiar with these processes  safe to say that it really will not matter where the original water source originates from if these processes are used  both microfiltration and reverse osmosis will remove most of the large particles and the uv light will kill off the organisms  using a spring water source would really be irrelevant at this point because you d essentially be stripping everything out of the water  leaving nothing but simple h2o all in all  the essentia didn t taste bad  and the flavorless electrolyte source is a great option if you re not a sports drink fan  also  the fact that it didn t taste  salty  like the disani type waters was a big plus for me  good taste   haven t hit on the benefits yet,1,0
3954,this shampoo out of the selection is only missing one ingredient  menthol  this ingredient gives the cooling sensation in the rest of the products  complete care  sport mint  clean and refresh  and the rest   literally every product has the same type of ingredients except this one  i didn t try one out yet  but just putting it out there  i am assuming that the amounts of the ingredients in each of the types are varied  this shampoo has no methol  cooling sensation  only,1,0
3953,i absolutely loves this cereal  and i was beyond excited to see that i could purchase it on amazon  but now  what in the world is going on with the price jump   the cost has doubled since my last order    i love this cerealy  but i cannot pay  8    10 for a 12oz box of cereal  i can t eat a bowl of cereal that cost that much   i don t know if kellogg s is doing away with the cereal or what s going on  but it s very hurtful that i am now loosing this option as well  what s up with the price jump ,1,0
3951,i don t really care to have to drag my two children into multiple stores to look for specific items  i ve seen numerous gluten free recipes utilizing teff flour and really wanted to try some and see how its texture and flavor enhance my gf baking  i can t wait to make glutenfreegirl s fig cookies with this  i used buckwheat flour in its place the first time  and the buckwheat flavor overpowered the rest of the flavors in my mind   which reminds me   i should probably set the figs to soak in their special mix     teff is tough to find elsewhere,1,0
3950,has an assortment of natural product such as beef tail  nose  tendons  bones  ears etc     my dog will eat anything that comes from this bag  regardless of the fact it may not be an easily identified body part   i looked at the label and i think that some of the items in the bag may not necessarily be listed on it   they kind of smell funny but leave no lasting odor after the dog eats them   regardless  these natural treats are easy on his stomach   and they seem to help his teeth out too   i feel merrick provides quality products and i will be purchasing it again  greyhound loves them ,1,0
3958,i don t know what it is about these little plastic toys but my kitties go crazy for them   they get so much joy out of flicking them and chasing them all around   sometimes they take them and try to hide them away from each other   i will say that i do not leave these out   when they are done playing with them i put them away in case of any choking hazard   better safe than sorry   5 stars though  they love them  my cats go crazy for these ,1,0
3949,i was thrilled to receive my order of tahitian vanilla beans so i could start cooking my custards and bake  ummmm  vanilla beans,1,0
3947,i love these little packets  i saw somewhere in the comments that another customer got a batch with an expire date on or near the same month  whoever sold them that box should have sent them a brand new one  mine won t expire for 2 or 3 years  it was made just this past month  i got them for emergancy use because they last so long  my only gripe is that a teenager must have designed the packets because they are so bloody hard to open  i had to look for a pair of pliars to get a grip on the pull tabs  and even then it was like pulling teeth to open because the plastic tray was so flexible it bent back along with the top cover  i have seen better designed jelly packets that allow the corner of the plastic under tray to be broken  and then it s much easier to open  i hope this manufacturer takes a hint and redesigns their product  other than that  the product tastes great  tastes great  but hard to open packets ,1,0
3945,if you have had fudge it hasn t been this good   when i got this i immediately put it in the fridge   by the time an hour passed it was able to be cut and tasted awesome  i am not a big chocolate fan but i eat too much of this  you had fudge  not like this ,1,0
3943,spices command a pretty penny  i typically buy large containers of spice from costco   costco has a very limited line and after running out of ginger  i was blown away by the supermarket prices for ginger    typically five dollars for an ounce to an ounce and a half   i was very pleased to find this product   i use ginger frequently and you get twice as much product for what you would spend at the supermarket   a low price doesn t mean much if the flavor is poor   i was happy with the flavoring   it yielded the flavor profile that i wanted   i m happy that the company sells other options like cilantro  which is a high cost dried herb   if you cook a lot with spices and herbs  i would consider this company note  if you want to save even more money  order directly from the company   google marshalls creek spices to find more spices from this company   the ginger on their website is under five dollars for six ounces but there is a higher shipping cost   so this option is probably better for those that want several bottles of spices  the taste is good and you cannot beat the price,1,0

3940,excellent products and customer service   you can read my review on the venus flytrap product page as well  joel will quickly get back to you if you ask for help please know  that you may receive a sundew that looks different from the one pictured  it isn t a problem for me  at all   but you should know  because you may get a green one that looks more  bunched  up than flat  and that s okay  nothing to lose your pants over  i actually like the look of mine just fine  great buy  may vary from pictured,1,0
3939,i try not to buy a lot of bottled water   it s expensive  and i don t like the extra plastic it creates even though i  always try to find a recycling bin for my empties   however  there are those days where i forget my water bottle or want more to drink than i carried with me   for those few days  i d choose essentia drinking water as often as i choose spring water even though essentia comes from municipal sources   essentia s silky texture is very cool   it reminds me of the lake and creek water we drink when out and about in rural alaska  note  you should not drink lake and creek water without verifying its safety    i chose to try out essentia since i was curious about the whole 9 5 ph thing   i don t feel any difference in consuming this ph of water  but did find it nice to drink as water in short  i can t say i ll be a regular consumer of essentia since i m not a regular consumer of bottled water   but on the few days that i am  this is a choice i d make  if i m going to buy bottled water  i ll seek this one out ,1,0
3938,essentia has two major claims about this water  it has a smooth taste  and it also has health benefits due to 9 5 ph level  i can confirm that it does indeed taste good  but my research on ph 9 5 benefits were not conclusive first of all  it really has high ph level  i have a test kit for my aquarium  and it confirmed that this water s ph is near asserted levels  but when i performed some research whether it really has benefits  i ended up with mixed results most majority of water sources  whether tap water  or special ones like fiji  seems be alkaline  high ph level   and i know that natural water sources that are advertised to have health benefits are also in this area  but they are usually not that high  at least recommended levels are up to 8 5   and they contain beneficial minerals  essentia lists only a few of them drinking such high ph would probably not upset your stomach  since our diets are highly acidic  this would only neutralize it   however i would not recommend it for any other use  for example coffee would not taste right  and it would probably kill your fish in the aquarium overall  this is much better than tap water  or regular bottled ones  while i cannot completely vouch for its chemical benefits  most of my research points in that direction  if the price is right  currently it seems to be higher than normal   i would recommend this  good water  but could not confirm ph 9 5 benefits,1,0
3948,i began taking this tea at 36 weeks  i was drinking three cups a day  to me the taste was rather bland  but honestly i was not drinking it for the taste  i was drinking it with the hopes that it would strengthen and tone my uterus  i did not have any abnormal side effects or cramping from this tea  i used an epidural during delivery and even though from what i heard about epidurals making for a longer  pushing  stage of labor  mine was actually unbelievably quick  my doctor had me push three times per contraction  baby crowned within the first contraction  and was born on the third  i pushed for less than ten minutes  could it have been the tea  i like to think so  this was my first baby  and even doctor and nurses commented on how well it went  i told them it must have been the tea  haha  since this was first pregnancy i really have nothing to compare it to  but when breastfeeding i do not feel any cramping and had very limited cramping postpartum  a couple of times the day of   day after delivery  i have continued to drink one cup a day since baby s birth  figure it can t hurt in helping uterus tone up   get back to size over next few weeks or so    can t hurt to try   ,1,0
3937,not sure why but the cats tend to like the juices more than the meats  but maybe thats just how all cats or just my cats are  i serve this as a treat rather than regular meal which i use dry food  cats seem to like it but mostly lick the juices sometimes leaving behind food,1,0
3959,i love this product  i do not notice any difference between this product and regular sugar  i consume a lot of sugar and am trying to cut back and i found this product on line  i ordered it and loved it  i am actually very surprised by the price of this product on amazon com  you can get the same 2 lbs of domino light  sugar and stevia blend  for  7 98 ea   at domino com or c h light com i requested to receive an alert when amazon com bought it in  and the price they are selling it at  is highway robbery as far as i am concerned  domino light  overpriced ,1,0
3962,i purchased the miracle noodle spinach angel hair pasta   i looked at many of the reviews prior to making my first bag   i did find that they have a strong fish odor upon opening   this was expected   i rinsed the noodles under cole water for 4 5 minutes   the odor decreased significantly   i boiled the noodles for about 7 minutes then rinsed under cold water   while boiling  i added a dry garlic rub so that the noodles may take in some of the flavor   after boiling  i rinsed the noodles under cold water for 30 seconds or so   to finish  i added about 1 1 5 teaspoons of garlic cooking creme  red pesto with truffles  and a touch of basil garlic parmasean dipping oil   i warmed the noodle sauce mixture for about 5 10 minutes   i admit  the noodle texture was interesting   i guess it was like an al dente ramen noodle   i wasn t expecting a spaghetti noodle though   i would definitely make again  not bad  not bad at all,1,0
3982,first  let me say     to those of you who are reading reviews to gauge if you should by this or not  please don t base if you buy it or not on those reviewers who gave 1 and 2 stars only because of the shipping  that has nothing to do with the juice itself  if you want to review the problem with shipping  don t leave it here  take it to amazon s customer care on to the actual review  great  i ve purchased maybe 8 different brands of  organic  juice in the last month alone and all have fallen flat  i finally found this one at the whole foods store  when i m out shopping for something new  i usually go to amazon com to search for the product and read the customer reviews while i m standing in the store with the product in my hand  this time  i was in such a hurry that i didn t because i actually thought that this would taste as bad as the other organic juices no matter what the reviews say  thank goodness i was surprised  my daughter loves it  i tasted it and it tastes great  no sugar added  yet it still tastes like fruit juice and not watered down crap  thanks for this  will continue to buy from the store  finally ,1,0
3981,our newborn had a lot of gas issues   we tried regular similac and enfamil and they didn t seem to help his gas   the other companies made  gentle  formulas because many had corn syrup as the first ingredient   gerber gentle does not our pediatrician suggested a soy based formula so we tried gerber soy   but that constipated him terribly   finally we found gerber good start gentle   it seemed to help his gas and also didn t constipate it   at 8 months old now  he still is taking it without any problems   we buy the ready to feed formula for on the go convenience  same ingredients as the powdered kind  the only reason that i m not giving it 4 stars is that i ve been buying it religiously on amazon due to the convenience   the other day i went to target and i realized the amazon price is  4 higher than target   3 higher if you use subscribe and save    too bad  but i guess it s my fault for not comparison shopping  the only non corn syrup formula that worked  but it s cheaper at target,1,0
3980,all in all  i actually liked this one pretty well  it left my waist length hair feeling fairly  fluffy  rather than limp or weighted down  hair seemed slightly less prone to frizz especially in the high florida humidity  easy to open cap is a nice touch and unlike similar items  this bottle didn t leak  also  i strongly preferred this fragrance over the other line all in all  a decent product with decent results for a decent price  nothing to get overly excited by but all in all  not a bad product whatsoever  not bad for the price,1,0
3979,i ve had better  but this is good coffee  it s a reasonable roast  not at all oily  with a nice aroma and not too bitter i like the resealable 1lb bags  with the big 5lb bags from cbd i could never get through a bag before the coffee started tasting stale or even moldy  ordering 3 resealable 1lb bags  that problem is gone  tasty coffee,1,0
3977,i agree wholeheartedly with some of the recent reviews below   my son has a dairy intolerance and i had to stop breastfeeding when he was 4 5 months old   this product was a lifesaver    he drinks it happily  and his symptoms  since switching to alimentum  have subsided  knock on wood  that said  beware of ordering through amazon  i ordered several cases for my baby through amazon prime almost one month ago   have received multiple emails telling me that the product is unavailable for shipment  meanwhile  several vendors list the product as available on amazon  including amazon s subsidiary  diapers com   i ve contacted customer service several times  but have continued to get the runaround   i suspect that this has to do with an attempt to avoid honoring the lower list price  the amazon prices drastically increased recently    it s a sad sad day when amazon disappoints   notably  when i ve ordered the full price product through diapers com  it s arrived the next day in any event  the formula itself has been great  great product   ,1,0
3976,i tried these when i found them on clearance at a local pet store   they were an instant hit with my greyhound   he has a sensitive stomach sometimes  but these didn t bother him at all   he chomps them down in minutes   they are good quality but they come with a price they have little odor and leave no mess on the floor   not greasy  not hairy  or too hard   they can fairly easily be broken in half to make two treats out of one tail   my only regret is i didn t buy more   one reviewer noted a choking swallowing problem  but my dog has had absolutely no problems with them  greyhound loves them ,1,0

3971,the keurig cups always had something missing  they reminded me of coffee but always tasted a little funny  i really do think it s all the plastic surrounding the coffee  i didn t get much use out of my keurig until i found this coffee  i am reordering today  real coffee   less plastic,1,0

3967,the glucotest really works  i wanted an alternative to sticking my diabetic cat s ears to test his glucose levels  he was getting inconsistent readings at the vet because he was too stressed out there   i took him off all grain  fed him canned meat catfood  then switched to the raw  frozen  meat diet   to successfully use the  purina glucotest confetti  make sure you mix it thoroughly into your cat s litter so it is all submerged  any pieces floating on top i found did not give an accurate reading the pieces that were submerged showed consistent readings and were verified by a recent blood test done at the vets when he was calm and not stressed  i checked the pieces by scooping up the clump of pee from litterbox and placing it on a piece of newspaper  that gave me room to pick out submerged confetti pieces with a pair of tweezers  that sounds wierd  but i am so pleased to be able to help my cat get healthy  he is stable now and getting better  saved my cat and me,1,0
3966,i m giving this four stars because i do  like  it  but i wouldn t give it any sort of enthusiastic endorsement only because it s actual cost benefit is hard to gauge from one bottle  i cannot speak to the benefit of any of the various claims about it s possible benefits   ph balance  etc i can speak to the taste  and i have no problems with it  it tastes like purified  filtered water with no special after taste  my girlfriend noticed a tingling taste on her tongue  and her theory was the added baking soda ingredient might have caused that  i did not notice that at all we drink filtered water from the tap   but it s well water   and for me the essentia was a step up in lack of any aftertaste  but i doubt i d spend money on a package of this  still  seemed like an acceptable bottled water option  tastes like purified water   other claims hard to gauge,1,0

3936,the label said this water is  smooth    dont know about you but i ve i ve never had water that wasn t smooth kind of like tap water in that it really isnt as tasteless as spring water   essentia  according to the label contains potassium  sodium  magnesium  calcium  as well as spring water   the label says it s best available ph at 9 5    not a clue what that means  the label also says it hydrates better   i m thinking this may be true as my thirst was quenched with less of essentia than of regular tap or spring water so i drank less   not sure if this is a good thing or not   also  i did not have to run to the bathroom in a half hour   this could be coincidence of course i have to admit i did feel a bit more energized by essentia   not sure if this was my imagination or just another coincidence all in all i found essentia to be a good experience   i would buy more thank you mef unflavored gatorade ,1,0

3904,this stuff is great   it claims that it is tasteless  but this stuff makes whatever i am adding it to taste better   perhaps this  tasteless  thickener allows the true flavors of the dish shine  where other thickeners have a flavor of their own which actually changes the flavor no need to make a slurry or fuss with this stuff   just sprinkle on towards the end of your cooking and stir it up   it thickens quickly and easily  high quality gluten free thickener,1,0
3903,fantastic coffee  at a a fraction of the price of the freeze dried keurig k cup s  all of which are made by the same company  with the same tasteless coffee bean  no matter what the name of the coffee   i can t imagine paying a dollar a cup for a  donut house  k cup that is made of folgers   what a joke  great coffee ,1,0

3900,my local supermarket has these available at its olive bar for  7 99 a pound  or about 50 cents an ounce  a typical olive bar price   this amazon deal works out to about 37 cents an ounce  which is a significant if not dramatic savings  assuming you re on prime i compared taste with some of the supermarket olives and they seemed the same to me  i suspect they all come from the same two or three farmer co ops in sicily  competitive with local grocer,1,0
3897,as the weather changes  i am on the lookout for this season s beverage   tried quite a few of the k cup offerings  but wanted to try something different nescafe memento cappuccino is a very good cool weather choice   the foamy top layer gives you the feel of a coffee shop beverage  without having to leave the comfort of your home   per their description  the premixed packets contain real coffee  milk and sugar  which is what  captured my attention in the first place   many of the coffee companies  in an attempt to help the consumer cut calories offer that horrible stevia stuff  which in my opinion leaves a horrible aftertaste and i avoid any products with that or sucralose as an ingredient not too sweet  not too bitter  a good combination of flavors and textures for that midafternoon break from the rest of the world  a good combination of flavors and textures,1,0
3907,i like bobs red mill products because they are not hiding behind deceptive label practices  what you read on the label is what you get i no longer by prepackaged or processed foods because they all have a tendency to lie  if you pay for a product you deserve to know exactly what is in it  white lies are still lies  love bobs red mill,1,0

3886,this is very good canned tuna   it s not the most mind blowing thing i ve ever eaten  i mean  it s still a can of tuna   when i was a child we all did a lot of tuna fishing in southern california  so i ve had tons of fresh and personally canned yellowfin   this isn t even close to fresh or personally canned  but then  it wouldn t be   anyway i just wanted to be sure to point that out it says it s packed in 100  virgin olive oil  and i m sure the manufacturer at least thinks that s the case   due to the recent massive international olive oil scam scandal that has finally been exposed  i m not convinced this really is 100  virgin olive oil   that kind of olive oil is rare enough that it probably wouldn t be wasted on this type of use   but i suppose it s possible that this is really 100  virgin olive oil   whatever the oil is  it seems to be of good quality    by the way  if you haven t heard of this olive oil issue  i suggest you google it before buying any more  olive  oil   and do the same for the  honey  scam too  which is even worse     i don t mean to sound negative about this product at all   i m enjoying it   it s meaty  nice quality  the can is well filled with product rather than filler oil  and the texture is good   it comes in large chunks which you can use chunky  or moosh into more of a pate texture  depending upon your preference i will definitely purchase this product again  very good   not totally mind blowing  still tuna    ,1,0

3910,i drank this in maui and really enjoyed it  came here to see if i could order it  rejoice  i could  at nearly  5 per bottle most people would think it s far too expensive for a simple drink  and i must admit it is  but ginger does have health benefits if i could convey an accurate sense of how this drink tastes i would but it s not easy  i guess the best way i can describe it would be if you took a large piece of raw ginger  minced it up real good and put it in a blender this is what it would taste like  it s got a real strong ginger taste and it s very good  not unpleasant at all if you suffer from lack of energy like me  maybe it s all the rains here in seattle   then this might be better than any starbucks which will set you back at least  4 if not more  when you look at it this way   4 50 per bottle really isn t that unreasonable packaging arrived in good condition  they really wrapped the case of gingerade up very well in bubble wrap  it was well protected  heavy though  took a while to ship  maybe it s coming from hawaii  haha  who knows  good stuff ,1,0

3920,i have to agree with the previous posters that this is by far the most delicious gluten free pasta i have tried  however do not purchase it if you have peanut allergies  each package bears a warning label stating  this product is not recommended for individuals with peanut allergies  contains lupin flour and lupin protein   this warning did not appear anywhere in the product description on amazon  and still does not appear today  just wanted to post this to warn people with peanut allergies who may not be familiar with lupin flour  delicious pasta   but not for peanut allergies ,1,0
3919,this product works well  you do not have to sit near the bathroom  i drink it at night and in the morning i use the bathroom  works great,1,0
3918,my husband does not like this syrup  but i think it s better than my home concocted sugar free chocolate syrup   i ve been avoiding sugar for so long that anything somewhat sweet and without a bitter or strange taste is ok with me   i appreciated manufacturers trying to make sugar free products  ok for a sugar free product,1,0

3915,i bought these along with the nordic ware platinum collection beehive cake pan for my son s winnie the pooh birthday party   they came nicely wrapped with a kind note from the company stating that if any bee were broken during shipment  to call them immediately and they would replace it them  free of charge   none of mine were broken  and were wrapped very securely   i would order the package of 48 to get your money s worth  or if you will be decorating a cake and cupcakes  as i did   with doing both  i had some left over and plan to use them again in the future  un bee lievably cute ,1,0
3913,i ve bought these before  at a lower cost  and i loved them  the only reason i haven t ordered more is that i don t like the price   34 20 for two bags is  17 10 per bag not  12 99   this looks like the price was increased but the descriptive info was never modified  what s the real price   what s the cost    ,1,0
3912,i have not been drinking as much as the box suggest but it tasted good to me  one interesting fact  after been drinking it for few weeks now i ve noticed some funny aftertaste  not every time even but you feel kinda like you ve smoked a cigarette  and i m not a smoker so how would i know  probably from being a second hand smoker    anyway i ve yet to tell you if id did what it advertised to do  slim tea,1,0
3777,this coffee was in a  sample  selection when we ordered our keurig brewer   it was by far our favorite   i have ordered this coffee several times from amazon   it is a dark roast  but not too strong  wolfgang puck coffee   sumatra kopi raya for keurig,1,0
3369,my comparison point is good old tap water run through a generic  brita  filter  cold the strength of this water is that it tastes almost as good   the tiniest bit plasticy in the back of the pallet  but not so much unless you re looking for it   i don t know what to say about the electrolytes and the ph level   seems a little gimmicky  but if it s your thing  then this is a good tasting vessel for its consumption the bottle is the thin  very collapsible kind  tastes a lot like    water ,1,0
3368,i m not an athlete   i ve read through the reviews of this from the athletes  and if i were an athlete it would probably be a big deal in my mind   on the other hand  i m like everyone and get sick from time to time   from being ill  i was dehydrated   my doctor immediately told me to start drinking gatorade or pediasure   i have never liked flavored sports drinks   i hate the fact that when i am already not feeling well  i have to drink something i can t stand the flavor of   i had previous tried smartwater to solve this issue  but it doesn t seem to be infused with enough electrolytes to help   so  this time i tried essentia   after about 2 liters  i did feel better   you know that sorta dry  swollen tongue thing that happens when you are dehydrated   that went away   i felt a little stronger between drinking this and taking my medicine   i asked the doctor if this was okay to drink instead of gatorade and he gave me the go ahead   so  here is what i liked 1   it pretty much tastes like water   there is a slight difference in taste from something like brita water  or most bottled water  but overall it s not a taste that drives me away 2   it is not sugary   this is what drives me away from gatorade   i hate the sugary taste of every one of their flavors   since this basically tastes like water  it is not sugary   this is the aspect that makes me dance for joy 3   it made me feel hydrated after a bottle   honestly  it was probably less than a bottle   if i wasn t already extremely dehydrated  it would have been even less than that   i love it when something makes you just feel better 4   it is a sporty water bottle that is made from environmentally safe products   i m not a total go green girl  but it is definitely a plus and something i am becoming more aware of   i know that several of my high school athletes are very big in the green shopping  so this is something i would recommend it   it s also good plastic that is easily recycled again the biggest con is the price   it s not unheard of for a 12 pack of water to be expensive  but it is definitely not a drink the average family would be able to purchase several times a week   a single bottle is just slightly more expensive than gatorade  but a 12 pack for about  25 is much different than the supermarket brand of water that is a 24 pack for  4 00   this is water that is for the electrolytes and rehydrating after a sickness or big work out  not an every day drinking water  great hydration ,1,0
3367,this is marketed the same way that toothpaste is   doctor recommended    which for me  has the opposite effect on credibility  strangely  this product does not have the usual fda disclaimer that i ve seen on other products   this statement has not been evaluated by the fda   evaluating this water just as a water  apart from the numerous health benefit claims  it s good  when at room temperature  the taste is a bit strange and off putting  when refrigerated and served cold  it is very refreshing and clean tasting  not sure what  best available ph at 9 5  means   this statement does not make sense  ph is a measurement of acidity or alkalinity  on a scale of 0 14  0 being a strong acid  14 being a strong base   normal water is neutral at 7   hydrates better  than what  what are we comparing this to  hydrates better than an english muffin  yes  it certainly does most of the other sales bullet points are standard and hardly worth mentioning   plastic is type 1 pete and can be easily recycled  but most beverage bottles are made of  1 or  2  i m not a fan of bottling water and the claims of reducing carbon footprint are bogus  these bottles have to be shipped across the country  using trucks and airplanes  which is not carbon neutral  it is far more environmentally friendly to get a filter treatment system and drink your local water supply  good cold  dubious marketing claims,1,0
2834,i love this coffee but the time i bought it before it was   50 cents a serving  this time i belive i paid 70cents per serving if it does not go back down i will probably not buy it again  black tiger k cups,1,0
2833,this is an extremely vigorous top fermenting yeast   as stated it is very alcohol resistant   the actual tolerance of this yeast strain for alcohol is somewhat higher then the stated 22   however the rate of fermentation does slow considerably above 22  this yeast strain also does not have any problem functioning in high gravity sugar solutions   so  i have found it unnecessary to do multi stage fermenting   this is a moderate sulphur producing yeast   nothing that should be a problem given some conditioning the flavor profile is actually fairly neutral  with just a little fruitiness   there is noticeable phenol alcohol production at temps above 80f   this is a bit of a  take no prisoners  kind of yeast   as in  it tends to ferment anything even remotely fermentable   in that way it s a bit like a champagne yeast overall  i m very pleased indeed   this is a great yeast for un sticking your fermentation  or for making a fast batch of cider   unless you like your cider very dry  you will probably want to cold crash your cider during peak fermentation   if you wait until primary fermentation is done  your likely to end up with rocket fuel instead of cider  very vigorous,1,0
2832,i purchased this for my marine corps husband to put in his care package  he is on his 2nd deployment in afghanistan   and this was delivered in 1 day     i couldnt believe it  i thought the email made a mistake  but nope   not even 24 hours later it s on my doorstep  talk about fast delivery  was delivered in 1 day   ,1,0

2827,we cannot believe how flavorful this kraft thick and spicy brown sugar barbecue sauce tastes   i used this to cook some very meaty chicken breast and the flavors popped   it s not too spicy for us and i assume it s because of the brown sugar   you can t go wrong with buying a product from kraft foods  great tasting,1,0

2821,for a soft style cookie  these are a bit crumbly  or maybe they were that way being sent in the mail   i enjoyed the taste of them   i am used to oatmeal cookies though  my boyfriend loves them and took off with half the box   i do feel slightly bad all the cookies are wrapped individually in a box   though i can recycle the box  it seems a lot of unnecessary packaging   overall  the cookies have a good soft yet crumble to them  they taste like oatmeal cookies with the tasty addition of chocolate chips and almonds  both of those items tasted true for form   not something i would go out of my way for  but if they were on sale or someone offered me one  i wouldn t refuse it  these disappeared from my kitchen though they are crumbly,1,0
2820,after ordering other so called  light  agave nectars which were much darker and added an unpleasant taste to the mararitas i make using only fresh lime juice  tequila and light agave nectar  it is a pleasure to receive a high quality product  a true  light  agave nectar ,1,0

2838,i will update this review as i don t think any firm conclusion has been reached we have an outdoor birdfeeder that has been victimized by racoons and a squirrel  i know it s the same one  because he has a crooked tail and is not bothered by humans   i spread the critter ridder out  and have not seen the squirrel since i can t believe one spreading would annoy a determined squirrel  but the evidence remains that i haven t seem him   so who knows it s rained since i treated the area a couple weeks back  and a raccoon came back and tried and failed to pull the feeder down   but i m sure the repellent has been diluted in the interim i am going to spread the ridder around again  and leave the feeder out   so we ll see if the raccoon comes back  he has to work pretty hard to dislodge the feeder  so maybe the ridder will make it not worth his while so for now  i like the product  i haven t seen the squirrel  so i can only go by the evidence  but   i m not a total believer yet  either  i ll update and change this review as more evidence comes in update 8 24  i still haven t seen that squirrel again  i sprinkled some more down  but i d still be very surprised if this was the complete solution  i do have a pair of chipmunks that run around the deck area  and i have seen them before and since i ve sprinkled the ridder   but they don t mess with the bird feeder anyway update 9 5  bird seed is declining rapidly  and while i haven t seen the squirrel  and there are a lot of birds   i suspect him  so i m spreading it again  and we ll see what happens  shows promise  but overall conclusion is hard to judge,1,0

2856,my husband and i both really loved this coffee  you won t be disappointed  it is not too dark and not too mild either and it has a really distinct flavor which you will love  the only thing is that it is kind of expensive  to buy it all at once  only not when you consider what it would cost in the store in those 12 ounce bags  that would come to about  6 80 a bag  so really it s not a bad price  i m going to have to get some more  really good tasting coffee ,1,0
2853,we ve been giving our brittany costco brand heavy meat dog food  he doesn t particularly like it  but the first ingredient is lamb  and he certainly eats it  i thought i d try this stuff instead  and i m shocked  he digs in like crazy  i can barely keep him from the bowl after i put it in  on taste  it must be a home run it loses a star  however  due to the first ingredient  corn  oh  and the third ingredient  corn  and the fourth  flour  dogs aren t omnivores  and i ve yet to see one farm any corn  let alone domesticate a crop and turn it into a staple grain  plus harvest it  blah blah  dogs aren t meant to eat that much corn  i ll spend the extra for real meat  and keep searching until i find a brand he loves to eat  dog loves it  but are they the right ingredients ,1,0

2851,i had purchased this on a trip to maui and loved the taste but was sad to use up what i had purchased   i was so happy to find this on amazon and that they shipped this product to md   i love the taste  the only thing reason i gave it a 4 star was because when i received my last purchase  the syrup looked old  there were large solid chunks when i opened the bottle   this wouldn t happen if the syrup were produced fairly recently  tasty hawaiian syrup,1,0

2847,i have been taking this product for the past 12 months   not only is it simple to take and easy on the taste buds  but as you will read also much more effective than i ever thought it would be   in addition  i have been taking direct source of milk thistle and tudca powder  free milk thistle powder 25 grams   tudca powder  tauroursodeoxycholic  5 grams  i am forty two years old and exercise regularly and eat moderately healthy i recently took a physical for a new position i acquired with a huge company and my total cholesterol was 149   i was completely taken off guard by hearing this number because the last time i had my cholesterol checked was three years ealrier and my total cholesterol at that time was over 200   i was 39 then  and in much better shape physically than i currently am   it is true what they say that the metabolism takes a sharp decline at 40  not joke there i assumed my cholesterol must have been at least somewhat lower but i had no idea that such a drastic change would occur   i believe these benecol smart chews along with the recommended dose of milk thistle and tudca have played a big part in this incredible drop from a once 200  cholesterol rating  i haven t grew any younger and my lifestyle is pretty much the same as it was three years ago  if not a little more relaxed  so needless to say  these are products i can highly recommend without prejudice  cholestrol dropped over 50 points,1,0

2840,this product is called by the manufacturer  a  water enhancer  and boasts to give you vitamins and energy with  an extra dose of vigor  and with 0 calories  sugar and carbs  with a fruit punch flavor from  all natural flavors   i was curious  so gave it a try you are supposed to use one squeeze per 8 ounces of water with this package holding 24 servings  depending on your squeeze time the drink will be weak  just right or strong  so you have to figure out how you like it  it does taste like fruit punch and is sweet thanks to the sucralose the product is red colored thanks to red dye  40 which some with dye allergies may like to know is present  in this product as for vitamins  it says it has 120  of the rda for vitamin c  and has 40 mg or less of vitamin bs and taurine  additives give electrolytes also the energy is thanks to the added natural caffeine  40 mg per serving this is good for covering up the bad taste of tap water or if you just hate the flavor of plain water  the best use of this for my family is to use it when my kids have no choice but to drink terrible tasting water while at boy scout camp  add this to that awful hose water they use at camp  and the scouts will drink the water provided and they will not only get hydrated but it adds some vitamins and electrolytes  however my family does try to avoid artificial sweeteners in our daily life this product basically turns your water into an electrolyte and caffeine drink with flavor  not unlike buying the sports drinks pre made except this is convenient to put into your own water in whatever container you use  water bottle for bike ride or whatever   you will save money by purchasing this instead of premixed energy drinks  too i think this product has its place although there is still debate over the necessity of drinking electrolyte drinks while doing non extreme exercising vs  drinking just plain water  and some people will continue to debate whether sucralose should be a part of our daily diets and others seek to avoid food dyes  i will stay out of the debate for my review   the purpose of my review is to tell you what is in this product and how it tastes  i ll let you decide if this is something you want or need to use  contains vitamins  caffeine and electrolytes  as well as red dye and sucralose,1,0
2839,i only like the sugar free mango   the sugar added ruins the taste   this and much ado about mango are the best   this one has a better price but my grandchildren went through the bag like they were woodchippers   the smaller bags slow down the consumption  as a result  they end up being cheaper per month   this product had smaller pieces  however  the small pieces were absolutely delicious   much ado about mango has changed their equipment and their product doesn t taste as good as it used to   this bare fruit actually tastes like the old much ado about mango which is delectible   trader joes is the cheapest but isn t consistent at all   sometimes it tastes like plastic smells  i m a nut for dried mango,1,0
2850,i ve eaten a lot of pasta in my life  this pasta has substance    it s chewy  not pasty like a lot of white flour pasta brands  and not gritty like a lot of whole wheat pastas   the label says it s  slow cooked  so perhaps that s why it is so good   only wish it was a little cheaper  though it s certainly not a bad deal at the subscribe n save price  the best pasta i have ever eaten ,1,0
2861,i ve been a stevia fan for a few years now   usually i buy it in 1 3 oz or 3oz bottles   almost always organic  and almost always 100  stevia what i like about this product  these packets of stevia travel easy  and the taste is good what i don t like   it s not 100  stevia  however  the only other ingredient is organic agave inulin  in fact  the inulin is the main ingredient   i didn t know what inulin was  so i had to look it up   it s  a polysaccharide based on fructose present in the roots of various plants  a little more research into inulin found that it has widespread use in the food industry  that s always raises a yellow flag for me  but digging deeper i found it didn t have any reported side effects   with that  i felt comfortable with this inulin   stevia combination  especially since the inulin comes from organic agave to elaborate on the taste factor  i ve noticed that different brands of stevia have distinctly different tastes  due to many factors    so while some stevia i love  others are  eh  and some qualify as all out  blech    this brand has a good taste  to me  anyway   your mileage may vary  it s a fine product that i have no problem recommending  i want to give it four and half stars  only because stevia is not the main ingredient   but i ll round it up to five  travels easy   good taste,1,0

2776,i got this tea on impulse  having never tried it nor read these reviews  i m prone to water retention if i consume too much sodium or get dehydrated  and it shows in my face right away  i didn t get this product for the poo results  but it definitely has some diuretic effect  because i shortly noticed i was urinating more often too  and within two days my facial bloat went down as other reviewers have said  it can make you cramp a little if you make it too strong or have too much  and you will be using the restroom more  but for short term bloating issues  it really worked for me  helps de bloat you,1,0
2783,the flavor is a little chalky if you mix it with just water  but it tastes just like the teas i ve had at the shops if you mix it with milk  the milk seems to get rid of the flat chalky flavor that just water makes  good stuff,1,0

2762,i ordered two 24 packs of the k cup portion packs and got exactly what the description said  there were 24 k cups in a brown paper bag  shipment came in a box  the box had 2 paper bags  with a variety of different flavors  the most repetition i found was 3 of the same flavor  because it was a grab bag  you do risk getting those gross  or at least to my pallet  flavors of eggnog flavored coffee  but it s still worth getting if most you will get is 2 3 of that flavor  there are brands of coffee i know i will not purchase a full box of because of this grab bag  grove square   hardly tastes like coffee  i need to add regular coffee brewing next to the keurig to dial down the creaminess of the orignial   all in all  money well spent  product is exactly what the description says   ,1,0

2928,when we first got this product my husband was in a hurry and tried just placing it at the top of the gopher holes  2 days passed and nothing  then when we had time  we went out and installed them correctly  digging out the tunnel and placing it in  then reburying it with some twine attached so we didn t loose it  we left it buried for 24 hours before checking it and sure enough  we had caught the gopher  it looked like it would be pretty nasty to try and get the gopher off the trap so we just buried the whole thing  we still had another trap if needed and at this cheap price  i didn t mind  works ,1,0
2927,i ve had artisana coconut butter before and it was solid from start to finish  to be fair i had it in the winter so it didn t get a chance to liquefy  it was bright white  had the somewhat gritty consistency of having ground up coconut flesh but as it warmed in my mouth it went smooth  so i ordered nutiva because it was a better value for the price  it s august  it arrived warm in a tan liquid form with a hard to stir solid on the bottom  it was disgusting  after a little work stirring it all up it started to solidify to a syrup    it would pour out if i tipped it  it was getting better at that point  though  a night in a cool cabinet and now it has reformed into a single layer light colored solid  it has grittiness to it but that s what the coconut s like  the flavor is good  i think artisana had a marginally better flavor  a strange  but rewarding experience in the end ,1,0

2923,we have used the product for years but can no longer get it locally the problem was with the description which says it comes as 8 count  1 13 oz box   apparently what this means is a box ontains 8 packets which is true   however  the way it is worded i expected to receive 24 boxes as i had ordered quantity of three   3x8 24   i received only three boxes at a cost of  26 97 which means ipaid  8 99 for one box of 8 packets   one box of 8 packets can be purchased anywhere including amazon for between  2 00 and  3 00   this order is being returned for refund if the price is actually  8 99 for one box  the description should read   price  8 99  quantity  one box of 8 packets   of course if it actually said that  they would never sell any at all   it is my opinion that the correct price is 8 boxes of 8 packets each for  8 99   that makes a lot more sense but that is just my opinion  uncleat quantity,1,0
2921,i really like the way this candy tastes  it s not too sweet  and doesn t taste too much like coffee  the balance is perfect  but the mane  reason i got these was for the caffeine  it takes at least 5 to equal the caffeine in a dr  pepper  which isn t bad  but i was hoping it would be more like 1 or 2  this is good stuff,1,0
2919,i like the quality ingredients of the natural balance line  however  the canned food has hickory smoke flavor added  and it is a little overwhelming  i know my dog doesn t care  but the smell lingers and i am not a fan of liquid smoke anyways  i might still buy this in future  since it is one of the cheapest pure lamb canned foods  unless i find something better  strong smoke smell,1,0
2929,i like xylichew because i can defend it as a health food  the xylitol supposedly reduces cavities  and the gum does not contain anything harmful unlike xyloburst and spry  which have a carcinogen  titanium dioxide  that is thought to cause cancer in human beings  those products made in china for americans should not be purchased by intelligent americans  titanium dioxide is nothing more than a food coloring  so xylichew will not be perfectly white  if this causes your brain to explode  then you had better buy spry instead and subject your body to the ravages of cancer the flavor does not last forever  because it s natural  but so what  one way to counter that would be to pop a mint in your mouth while chewing and let the gum absorb the mint flavor  gourmet gum  non carcinogenic,1,0
2918,bought a keurig for times when a single cup of coffee is all that is needed   what i had not anticipated was that my husband was underwhelmed with the assortment of coffees that came with the brewer    until i found the double black diamond extra bold  now my keurig is being used for afternoon coffee breaks and i don t feel like my  investment  is headed to a yard sale thrift shop anytime soon   if you are a lover of stronger  premium coffee  this may be exactly what you are looking for when a pot of coffee is simply too much for one  got my hubby s approval,1,0

2914,the 2 54 ounce package is too big to use as an individual serving  but contains 10 individual wafers that must be carefully broken apart   the small individual wafers are perhaps a confection that you would serve with coffee   they are multilayered wafers   i am reviewing the hazlenut cream filled   which form a light  flavorful treat   i would not recommend them for an individual dessert  but perhaps they could be used as teatime treats for afternoon social functions   they packages have a pull tab  somewhat like you find on packages of chewing gum  etc   for ease of opening   the package indicates five of the small wafers as a serving size  but i think that would be too much   they are quite filling  a light confection,1,0
2913,i purchased the  indoor adult 27  formula by accident after using the royal canin dry cat food  indoor mature 27 formula  5 5 pound bag for one of my older cats   i found that my cats liked this formula as much as the mature cat formula   after my senior cat passed on  i continued buying the indoor adult for my middle aged cats they really like the taste and their waste products seem reduced and not at all smelly like with cheaper foods   they also rarely throw this food up  but with some other foods it seemed like that was a weekly occurence   i know it s expensive  but i feel that it s high quality and will keep buying for my kitties     my cats really like this food,1,0
2912,i buy this at local grocer but it has been out of stock lately  since my one outdoor cat is fussy he will eat nothing but this food  not even the other flavors  has to be the grillers blend  so  i had to find it online and while amazon was the least costly of the options its still too high  i pay roughly  12 for the large bag at the grocer  the 9 pounds in this 3 pack were a couple dollars more  even with prime shipping its too much  buy at walmart or grocer  cats love this  will eat nothing else  amazon cost is too high though,1,0

2930,product does contain alkyloids but is week      i wonder if powdered organic material is 100  coca leaf or if it is combinatioan of ingredients  i am not previous familiar with this product in its natural precursor state  the ground up powder smells like alfalfa   perhaps the mix leaf and green tea together at a ratio to reduce alkyloid content to legal levels  i would like to try whole leaf instead of powedered next time  i wouldnt hesitate to try this product as it does have actives   best bet is chew with high ph substsance such as lime or soda to extract actives  can this stuff be smoked  contains alkyloid but is week    ,1,0

2952,wow   there are very mixed reviews for this item  after reading a bulk of them  i still decided to order the product because i didn t know of another way to try a variety of flavors without buying a box of each  the description above states that you will be able to try 27 different flavors of coffee without buying 27 different boxes  they must have changed the description  since a few of the reviews state that it reads 35 different varieties   after tallying them all up  i only ended up with 21 different varieties  sigh   i use the word  varieties  and not  flavors  because i did receive several french vanillas and hazelnuts  but they were from different companies  my cups also came packaged in a box  so perhaps they ve done away with the paper bag thing here s the breakdown of what i received  green mountain  wild mountain blueberry  2   southern pecan  2   french vanilla iced  2   caramel vanilla cream  2   mocha nut fudge  2   island coconut  2   hazelnut noisette  hazelnut decaf  french vanilla  french vanilla decaf  donut house  chocolate glazed donut  2   cinnamon roll  2   grove square  hazelnut cappuccino  2   french vanilla cappuccino  2   caramel cappuccino  2   gloria jean s  mudslide  2   butter toffee  2   hazelnut  french vanilla supreme  wolfgang puck  hawaiian hazelnut aloha noisette  timothy s  kahlua original  2  these just came today  so i have only tried the green mountain island coconut so far   over ice  i don t drink hot coffee   i know  weird  right    i love coconut  so this is my new favorite  i am already planning on buying a couple of boxes of this one tomorrow  i didn t even add anything to it   just drank it black  and loved it so  i think this would have received five stars from me if only it had actually contained what it said it was going to  27 different flavors    but again  i am not unhappy with the variety that i did receive  not unhappy,1,0

2948,my partner was getting distressed with the lack of taste in her k cup coffee  my bad  since i m the one who buys the coffee   and she requested something with a bolder taste  so  i tried this  we have used green mountain coffee before  but not this particular product bottom line  my partner really enjoys this  the taste meets her expectations  indeed  although i am supposed to keep my intake of caffeine fairly low  i have also tried this on occasion  and i  too  am satisfied so  if you want a bolder flavor  this is worth considering  nice bold taste,1,0
2931,i have previously praised cesar dog food as being the only thing my finicky mademoiselle will deign to eat  well  that didn t last  she figured out i was hiding her pills in it and that was that  so i cast about looking for something different enough to entice her  and fell upon chef michael s she loves it  snarfs it pros1  it isn t vile  some varieties smell like it s homemade 2  related to above  it is even a convincing  oh they re giving me people food  3  it gets eaten  other foods sit ignored and wind up in the trash  even the very similar beneful chicken stew  i don t understand it cons1  it s expensive 2  it s a teeny serving  this is for the smallest of breeds or lightest eaters  gigi is sometimes still hungry after dinner  she s begun having two beggin strips for breakfast to get her through honestly  if gig ate anything else  i wouldn t buy this  maybe if i had a mini yorkie or something under ten pounds  i don t really recommend it for dogs bigger than that  because it s so little i know overfeeding is a problem  and we tend to think of portions on our scale rather than theirs  but when my picky eater is poking around her dinner bowl and licking it an hour after eating  it tells me she s still hungry  it s a tricky matter  they think it s  people food  ,1,0

2945,tasted good  not rancid tasting like the supermarket oils  liked the plastic bottle with the spout  fair oil for the price  the only reason i did not give it five star was that it was a product of mexico  it was only bottled in california  i prefer my olives to come from the usa because of our stricter pesticide herbicide restrictions  no where on the amazon description does it state that the olives are from mexico  on baja precious  web site it does show the back label showing a product of mexico so i will give the company props for that  i just feel the amazon listing was misleading  so in conclusion  the price is very good for an average olive oil that tastes fresh  this is assuming that this is truly 100  olive oil and not watered down with canola oil and chlorophyll  see the book  extra virginity the sublime and scandalous world of olive oil     product of mexico not california ,1,0

2939,personally  i do not like coconut at all or anything that has coconut flavors  i ve been like that all my life  i m like the only one in my family that doesn t like coconut  for some reason  i decided to give this a try  i bought the mango flavor to help me with drinking the coconut water and i was surprised  it didn t have the strong coconut flavor that i have tasted in other foods or beverages  i barely even tasted the coconut  if i didn t know this was coconut water with mango  i would have thought it was some other drink and this is all natural  i ve been hearing alot of good things about coconut water  i just hope that it doesn t upset my stomach later on because i ve been having digestive issues so i m keeping my fingers crossed  so now i m thinking of trying just plain coconut water and see how that turns out  i m surprised ,1,0
2936,most energy drinks i have to choke down   this is the only one i ve ever tasted that actually takes good   in fact it tastes quite good the taste is like a weak lemonade   i personally can t pick up the tea taste  which i don t mind  as i am not crazy about tea i don t notice any particular energy boost   but i believe it has about 170 mg of caffeine  so it ought to have not quite the kick of a no doze pill seriously  this i d actually drink for the taste  the only energy drink that tastes good,1,0
2934,i m not a coffee snob  if i was  i doubt i d own a keurig  i just want a decent tasting cup of coffee with little cleanup i ve tried many of the flavored coffees  but they re too gimmicky for me  starbucks brand tastes burnt to me  even their blonde roast    in stores i mean  i have not tried the starbucks brand kcups i like this breakfast blend because it s not too dark  not too light  it tastes like what no frills coffee should taste like  i order the biggest size to get the best value update  i just tried to create a review for the  jamaica me crazy  coconut flavor  which i thought was terrible   and i  love  coconut   i should specify that the original review was for  breakfast in bed   great balance,1,0
2946,this flavor is strong  as it should be  and not bitter  doing a blind taste test  couldn t tell any difference in this espresso and one pulled from my breville espresso machine  good espresso,1,0
2863,yummy earth has made a much healthier version of the conventional gummy worm  regular gummy worms contain chemicals and tons of high fructose and other sugars that aren t very desirable  the yummy earth gummy worms are made from real fruit juice and nothing artificial  the flavor also tastes unprocessed  almost as if you are eating real ingredients  the sour coating is just right    not too sour  the worms are smaller in size than most conventional worms but that doesn t bother my kids one bit  great healthier candy option,1,0
2907,i have 2 big labs   they play hard  work even harder and are fed a high protein diet   just wanted to suppliment there regular dry food with this stuff   i don t like to waste money on dog food that they will not eat   so since this was free  why not try it  my dogs are also picky in what they choose to eat   they themself s have elected not to eat sweets  even though i have offered it to them   they don t eat crap like chips and popcorn   so when i offered beneful to them they sniffed it  then took only  1  kibble   they rolled it around in their mouth and then finally chewed it   yes my dogs do this with new food introduced to them   they then preceeded to scarf this dog food up and even wanted more   even though my dogs eat their vegetables   they prefer baked califlower  i will now on add a cup of beneful to their dry food   reading the label  this food is a good additive to a high protein diet for your dog   hey 2 champion hunter tracker service dogs can t be wrong   woof purina beneful dog food,1,0
2905,best cat litter ever   i will never go back to clay litter  smells like a pine forest  even after my cat has filled it with c  p   i don t normally order it on line  but we were moving cross country and i had it sent to the new apartment so it was waiting when we got there  which it was  which made the move a little less stressful   at least for me  my cat still hates moving  love it ,1,0
2883,i have read all the benefits of maca  and love th idea of using it  i used to add it to my morning smoothies  however i have just read from one of the reviews that the root  this product  should not be eaten raw  hmmm  i didn t know that  if that s the truth  i don t have any use for it  as i rarely cook anything with heat  i was getting it for my breakfast  which i just mix into a smoothie i also went online and found this  maca contains glucosinolates  which can cause goitres  enlargement of the thyroid gland  when consumed in high volume in combination with a diet low in iodine so  apparently  if you have thyroid problems  don t use it  i guess  giving it a good rating just because of all good things it does for us  nut now i am not sure i will be adding it to my diet    it s supposed to be a good product,1,0
2881,i absolutely love the nantucket blend  its not too bold  but yet not too weak either  the flavor is great and with a splash of creamer i m out the door  yummmy,1,0
2880,i love anything to do with tea  but when i m on the run  or don t want to deal with tea leaves  all my teas are loose  because honestly  it s just better that way   something instant is always a good idea  since chai tea began my love for tea  i began searching for the perfect instant chai  when i found this  i was extremely skeptical  how can this tiny little thing make 100 cups of tea  and the price  why should i pay that much money for something that might not taste good luckily for me  i had just gotten paid the day before  so i bought this on a whim and crossed my fingers when this arrived  i was so excited that i couldn t help but make a cup right then and there  the tin is very  very small  which deterred me somewhat  but i pressed on  a tiny wooden spoon rests inside the chai  and if you can t find it  try digging it up a little with a toothpick   i took a spoonful of the mix and put it into a 12 oz cup  and added another scoop for good measure  i added a little hot water and some milk and took my first sip  the spices hit me like a train  after swallowing  it leaves a trickle of spice in the back of your throat  something very few chais have managed to do  this chai is very spicy  but not cinnamon spicy like some other chais  the taste is truly organic if you don t like chai that s loaded with spice  then this tea isn t the one for you  but if you don t like spicy teas  you shouldn t be seeking out traditional chais  this tea most likely won t last me through 100 cups  as i like my tea strong   so i guess 50 will have to do  for  0 34 a cup   0 16 if you only use one scoopful   you can t really go wrong  i would highly suggest trying this one out  super spicy  just the way i like it,1,0
2879,these are amazing    be cautioned because they are hard to stop eating   i found them in store recently  for 3 99 by the way  and my mother and i both cannot stop buying or eating them   i had to buy a separate bag for my boyfriend so i wouldn t have to share   nothing bad i can say about this product  except that it seems maybe amazon made a mistake with the price    awesome  wrong price  ,1,0
2878,reading up on this company i m blown away by the care and knowledge that goes into this food   i can t even know if i m getting gentically modified food or other junk when i go eat lunch today but here there is an approach to pet food i hope i can enjoy one day as a human   i would trust anything this company puts on the market   i hope this level on integrity catches on with other companies  i wish the food i ate was so reliably healthy,1,0
2877,i ordered some of these annie chun s seaweed snacks after watching a friend much on roasted seaweed   after searching on amazon  i chose these and two flavors from sea s gift   i chose the roasted sesame flavor over the other flavors because the ingredients are simpler   each package has small  but not tiny  rectangles of seaweed lined up on a tray   i fold the pieces in half and stuff them in my mouth   i find that if i bite the seaweed  i get more  crumbs    either way  i still wind up with pieces of seaweed on my shirt and have to check myself in the mirror after eating  also pieces get stuck in my teeth like spinach  so i have learned to check that  too   i like the texture of this seaweed paper thin  light  and crisp   i like the flavor mild   i prefer this brand to sea s gift because of the milder flavor   they seem fresh   i did not detect any off tastes or rancidity   i appreciate the high vitamin content and the low calories   i reach for these when i want something crunchy   i eat them as a snack in between meals to keep me from eating crackers  i also eat them along side a meal instead of crackers  go to snack,1,0
2875,of the fruit leathers  this is one of my preferred flavors   i like the package of all one flavor so i don t have a multi pack with less preferred flavors like apple   compared to most dried mango  this has less flavor and tenderness  but because it is a dried puree  it is a different product and thus can t 100  be compared  i would give philippine brand dried mango five stars and this mango fruit leather four stars   these fruit leathers come in single serve packets  which  like all single serve packets  are wasteful  so i try to use these when i need the packaging  such as on the go  in the pocket  camping  and travel   they are very slim and can be tucked in anywhere  slim  on the go  single flavor,1,0
2884,i thought i was getting larger containers than the individual 8oz  containers received   either it was not clearly stated or i missed it        however  its soy milk  its good and i will pay closer attention   and if unsure  i won t purchase   but soy silk is a good product   we re just not people who drink milk during the day out of sippy straws       great buy for kids and to be placed in lunches  not what expected     but good,1,0
2874,this brand is a little hard to find in stores as i don t think it s carried by any of the major supermarket chains  i discovered it at au bon pain and noticed that unlike other brands i ve tried  this one is not from concentrate and has nothing added  it s just pure unadultered coconut water  so the quality can t get much better  the other thing i really like about it is that it s a glass container rather than paper or plastic  so the taste is not compromised  these things alone are worth 5 stars to me but there are a couple things i would suggest to make it even better  first  this isn t really pulp the way you would think of it from you experience with fruit juices where there s pulverized  very small  drinkable pieces floating in the liquid  these are chunks of diced coconut that you have to chew up while drinking  to me  this would be fine if they were all the soft flesh you d expect from a young cocunut but many of the pieces are harder which is unpleasant in a drink  second  9 5 ounces doesn t go a long way  i d like to see it bumped up to at least a 12oz  i d then feel like i m getting an adequate amount for my money and it would last longer and quench better  love this stuff  ,1,0
2871,i buy them from walmart  extremely small  nothing like the commercial  but what can you expect for 90 calories and a 20  dv of fiber  i ate one as soon as i got them to my car and was disappointed  it tasted artificial  like hersheys syrup and had a weird texture  the next time i tried it i removed it from wrapper and i heated it up about 20 seconds in the microwave  complete difference  moist chewy  the chocolate ribbons were melted and it actually tasted like a delicious brownie  i ll definitely repurchase  took off one star for the inconvenience of it not being an on the go snack for me like i thought  since i will only eat them heated  i would still recommend  tasty when heated,1,0
2870,i had a friend who recommended that i buy a sample of coffees for my keurig from amazon   she had checked out and found amazon had the largest selection at the best prices   i had purchased some kcup coffees from walmart  grocery stores and i hated the flavors that i bought   i am too cheap to waste the coffee  so i am going to drink them until they are gone   with the sample pack  you only get one sample  then you taste   decide whether to buy it or not   you will not be stuck drinking coffee that you hate  great way to sample kcup coffees,1,0

2868,9 24 12  i just gotta add that not only can i not stop eating this stuff  i cannot stop sending to everyone i know  boxes of this popcorn or being flown all over the country to friends and family  it is just fun to share this new discovery    this popcorn truly is the best i have ever had including theater  stove top  air pop  jiffy pop  etc  it is light  fresh  and very crunchy  with the right touch of salt   for me anyway  my husband does want more salt on his  we found this popcorn to be so flavorful that addition of butter or other seasonings just aren t wanted in our microwave  2mins and 20 secs gets nearly every kernel popped  the remaining partially popped kernels  old maids as we used to call them  are softer than other brands so accidentally eating one does not gum up the bridge work or break a tooth note for those with food allergies   we tried the butter flavor and it caused me  an asthma sufferer with food allergies  to seriously cough and choke  the ingredients look pretty innocent so i tried the butter flavor a few times just to make sure    results were unfortunately the same each time    me grabbing for the rescue inhaler and giving the bowl to someone else to finish looking at the short  simple list of ingredients  it is not clear what about the butter flavor causes the allergic reaction  unless there is something actually in the  natural butter flavor  itself   perhaps it is an extract of some type  don t know  but stick with the plain and  at least for this allergy sufferer  all is fine  the best   no need to add anything,1,0
2867,a co worker of mine recommended this candy and i was anxious to try something new  i thought the flavors were nice and distinct  however  the disintegrating grainy texture was less than desirable of a sensation to me  also  the product was quite expensive for a small bag  but my rating does not reflect my unhappiness regarding the size of the item   good flavor  interesting texture,1,0
2866,i like lime  i drink it all the time  although i m not a mime  i know it s not a crime  i hope you like my rhyme  lime indeed,1,0
2865,so i don t really have dandruff  but i do have scalp itch from time to time what this shampoo has done for me is to remove the scalp itch from my life compared to head and shoulders  it uses the same active ingredient  you have to decide if you care about all the extra stuff  like ginseng  being included  to me  it hasn t really changed the way my scalp feels between the two for me it all comes down to price  i ll buy whichever is less expensive when i need to purchase new shampoo  smells good and works well,1,0
2872,i never really liked green tee before but i kept drinking it for it s health benefits  most recently  i started to like the white tea version of this peachy flavor from celestial seasonings  but i was disappointed to find out that they discontinued that product   then i realized they had this green tea with peach flavor  and decided to try it i m so glad i gave a shot because i like green tea now   it s much better tasting than plain green tea with a hint of peach  i can drink this a couple of times a day easily   in my opinion  it s still not as sharp as a good black tea  but it s a close second by the way  as of the time of this review  the picture on the product page belongs to the discontinued white tea  a real treat,1,0

2885,diamond nuts harvest reserve walnut halves  6 ounce bags  pack of 12 what i liked most was that the walnuts lived up to what was advertised on the package label it says  diamond walnut halves    indeed  for each ofthe packages  3  that i have opened so far  virtually all the contentsof each package were walnut halves with only a very  very few pieces   walnut halves,1,0
2887,my boyfriend who works at small chain pet store turned me on to stella and chewy s  i can t say enough good things  i have a dachshund with skin and weight problems  we were on the hunt for a grain free food he wouldn t turn his long nose up at and were just coming up short in all respects  he hated everything  one of the first suggestions was stella and chewy s but i shrugged it off because to me  the price was much too high  my dog food experience up until this point sadly was one of frugality rather than what you re actually feeding the dog   after buying bag after bag of things he didn t even want to taste  i caved and we bought him a small bag of these patties  he wolfed it down  i was shocked the better result came when my mother s chihuahua min pin mix got herself a taste  this dog weighs next to nothing because she refuses to eat all but one flavor of a certain cheap o canned food  and even then you have to specially prepare it before she even thinks about wanting to eat  i gave her a small piece and it was gone before i knew it  she hoarked down a whole patty in seconds  amazing if you have a picky eater  especially a picky small breed dog  this is well worth the investment  five stars   d winning the picky little dog battle   ,1,0

2902,just bought this while in america temporarily  and quite frankly i don t think much has to be said about this  it is my tea of choice when i m in ireland  and i was desperate enough to have to seek it out while i am in the us for the summer it s barry s  you can t go wrong  it s barry s,1,0
2901,you can t find this flavor anywhere else in america to my knowledge  or at least not easily  and to be sure it won t appeal to everybody  but i am the type of american that prefers salty flavors to sweet  in fact  i don t like most candy because it is too sweet for me to my surprise  the nutrition information for this product claims zero sodium  apparently  ammonium chloride is not metabolized as sodium in the human body  so the  salt  label is a bit of a misnomer  yes  technically ammonia chloride is a salt  but not table salt and not sodium  i guess i will find out in a couple of hours how this stuff agrees with my digestive system  but if i m allergic to it  that s my bad  not the fault of the product  prior to k   h s double salt licorice  i tried the diamond  zout  salt licorice by gerrit verbourg  which was also yummy  so i know already i am not very allergic i like the taste  but it s not mind blowing  i don t feel overpowered by the saltiness at all  i can pop three in my mouth at a time and chew with no problem  however  i have learned not to chew  i recommend sucking on the tokens instead until they slowly dissolve  this way a more intense licorice flavor is achieved  and less candy sticks to one s molars one cautionary note  this coming from my mother  that i would like to add for all licorice aficionados like myself  consume licorice in moderation  why  no  not because of tooth decay  although that s a good reason too  this candy being gooey and sticking to teeth  not because of the calories  although calories is a valid concern  not even because of the ammonia chloride  although that may have certain negative effects on human digestion in large quantities    really the chief concern is that the licorice itself  and licorice extract  interferes with the human body s absorption of potassium and also has many other complicated interactions with the body  if you like licorice  a good idea would be to add bananas to your diet as well  because bananas are cheap  delicious and rich in potassium  but do not eat large quantities every day  if you find yourself bruising easily and taking a long time to recover from bruises  your licorice habit could be the cause  word to the wise  everything in moderation  dontcha know five stars because the product was just what it said it was  was manufactured 02 2012 and doesn t expire until 2014  all in all  an excellent value considering the price  and amazon had it on my front porch less than two days after i ordered it  maybe there is better salt licorice for sale somewhere on the internet  i don t know  but i know for sure there isn t cheaper licorice  note to other reviewers  no fair dissing the product because you don t like ammonia chloride  don t buy it if you don t know what it is  an adventure for the american taste buds,1,0

2898,we have a 7 month old havanese who has a very sensitive stomach   he came to us with royal canin indoor puppy but he was scratching constantly   i got him some generic puppy food thinking dog food is dog food right   wrong   he ate it and liked it but about a week later had diarrhea   we didnt know it was the food at first  but after reading the ingredients realized it was the corn in it causing his reaction   i then began to do research and switched him to nutro small bites with chicken meal  rice and oatmeal  also a bad idea   he didnt even eat it  i mixed it with some chicken broth  which helped  but then the diarrhea returned   so  i finally found orijen   i wish i had just gotten it in the first place   he loves it and always begs for more although we don t give in because i dont want to over feed him   but  there is no more itching  his poop is firm and round and since we re not feeding him as much now  the cost is not a factor   i would definitely recommend this food to everyone  finally ,1,0
2886,this tea is very effective for constipation   it usually works for me within 12 hours of taking it   however  the issues i have with this tea is that it causes major cramping and the taste is awful    but  i will continue to use it because it works so well  works wonderfully,1,0
2897,i use this product for just about everything when cooking  i use it to cook fish  i put it on steamed veggies  baked potatoes   basically anything i would ordinarily use butter or  yuck  margarine for  i have used this product to replace   8 08 is a great price for this product  i ve paid as much as  11 50 for the same product in local health food stores  shipping costs negate the savings though  for me anyway  great for cooking,1,0

2894,i ve said it before on another review  spitz seeds   best on market   tried lots  spitz wins   the salted version isn t the best of their make  but what it has over the other makers  besides a nice big seed  not a tiny shriveled up kernel  is that the salt isn t over powering  so your mouth starts to hurt   its just enough salt to allow you to eat them all day      not too salty  nice big meaty seed ,1,0

2891,this stuff is actually rougher on the stomach and rectum than it is on the mouth  it really only burns where it is directly contacting your mouth toungue  and you wouldn t notice it as much if you mixed it in with something  if you do put it directly on your tongue it burns it until it is numbthe flavor is quite mediocre  different than any hot sauce i ve tasted personally  but not necessarily in a good way however  you ll note on the bottle that it is a good industrial cleaner and grease remove  and this is true i use it on all of my pots and pans when after i cook in them  and i use it to clean my bathroom  i also used it on my baby  but now i don t have a baby anymore for the dynamic aspect of it  it gets 5 stars  not quite as hot as i expected  but it has its uses ,1,0
2890,purchased this product  because my regular brand was not available   the flavor is good although my preferred brand is better   because my  brand  wasn t available again  i decided to subscribe to green mountain s columbian coffee  just prior to my next scheduled delivery i received an e mail that my preferred brand was in stock  i m a prime member and expected my green mountain order  in a day or two  but i did not receive my coffee for a week   what s the point of subscribing   prime when your order is that late  i ordered my old favorite which i received in two days  one day after my late subscription   i had contacted customer service regarding the late delivery and an accommodation was made  but i did cancel my subscription to green mounttain   hence the 4 stars  coffee is good  delivery was not ,1,0

2759,i have just discovered this coffee and i am all in on this trio  i do not even know where to begin  i liked all three of the flavors  as each had its own personality and taste  i was not a fan of hazelnut until i tried the vanilla hazelnut flavor  now i am hooked  i could taste the subtle vanilla flavor and the hazelnut was not too overwhelming  i really liked the chocolate caramel brownie and the toasted southern pecan  these flavors really made my mouth happy  none of the flavors left an aftertaste  none of the coffees were bitter or acidic  i have not done it yet  i am going to try each of the coffees as an iced coffee treat as this is how much i enjoyed the coffee  i feel the cooffee can stand up to being iced  the flavors are that good not too strong  not too weak  full flavored enough to be iced  take advantage of the subscribe and save  if you try this coffee treat trio  i am sure you will not be sorry you did yes i recommend this if you are looking for a good quality coffe and a change from the same ole same ole  i m all in,1,0

2632,i received my first box of these a year ago  and have ordered two since then  the first box was excellent and i d give five stars for that experience  the second box seemed  stale   and i was a little surprised about that  because i didn t even know they could get stale    but the sucker bits get a bit more brittle  and the tootsie roll inside gets hard as rock  i received my third box a week ago  figuring that the second box was a fluke  and these seem even worse  they re still alright  but not great  i m undecided on whether or not i ll get another box  as i seem to be detecting a downward trend in quality  now vs then,1,0

2640,my son is always bugging me for lollipops but i don t him very often because i don t want him to eat too much artificial colors and flavors  but this one is organic and you can really taste the taste of the fruits  not so sweet and tasty as the regular one but it s organic ,1,0

2627,this review is for the packaging and not the actual mix  since the mix is a very subjective thing and my taste my not match others and  some wrote about how poor the packaging was  all i can say is with mine there is more than enough labeling  on the bags themselves and on the box there are instructions on how to  granted the box is nothing heavy duty or special and the mix is in plain white bags  there are more than enough instructions to go by  packaging was sufficient,1,0
2626,i agree with the reviewer that said it did not look at all like flaked  at least what i think of as flakes   at first i thought amazon had sent me the wrong product but i read the label and it said flaked  so flaked it must be no matter  the cats all loved it  licked the plate clean and i will be purchasing again  my cats also love this tuna,1,0
2625,this is a quality food product manufactured from soda ash using the leaching process  unlike others that use the sodium hydroxide and water formula  this product far exceeds other lye waters for culinary use and does not crystallize or cloud  uniformity of ph is extemely consistent  pinoy fiesta lye water,1,0
2623,i love chiclets  too bad the manufacturer may have blown it by using a new rubbery gum base that renders it almost impossible to chew after a couple of minutes   yet another fine product down the drain due to what is likely to be cost cutting   beware,1,0
2622,i was looking for a cheaper alternative to nutiva brand and thought i d try this vitacost  i will pay more for the nutiva in the future because it has such a nice coconut flavor  this oil is flavorless  other than that it performs just as well  pretty good but lacks flavor,1,0
2620,i ve spent hours in the last few months searching for coconut water with good credentials  specifically  one  that was   not from concentrate   however  just about every brand that people   brag about    particularly on amazon where many seem to push specific brands    one above others  to the point they seem like paid reviews or advertisements  are all from concentrate  i had pretty much given up and was willing to settle for what was available  when i stumbled across this can  literally right after buying 2 large cartons of another brand at another store  funny thing was i found this after leaving my local tj s to grab some extra items at the safest of ways  i stumbled across a can of this and nearly skipped it over chalking up the typical image of a coconut  claims of awesome taste  and the fact that i d read bad things about coconut water in a can  i did a double take when i saw an easily skipped over statement of   not from concentrate   after i had already put it back on the shelf  and decided to pony up and give it a try head to head with what i had already bought frankly   i loved it  the other brands were moot points to me then and there  and i immediately started searching for a cheaper way to get it when i got home  which was easy as their website pointed me right back to amazon  but it wasn t in stock  i ordered anyway  but i m still waiting for my order to ship  i have had 5 or 6 cans at the  3 price from the store so far because i couldn t wait  and that s all they had left in stock  who knows if they will restock or if things will change  i will remain loyal as long as the product stays the same if my order shows up and things have changed  i will update my review mind you  this review is only for the can  as i think the larger carton is listed as   from concentrate   like every other brand  the carton was also noticeably missing the   best tasting   badge prominently placed on the can  perfectly subtle flavor   not from concentrate,1,0
2629,this coffee arrived as expected and when i ground the beans ahh the aroma that filled the kitchen when i first tried it was extremely pleased with the purchase but  be warned this thing is not for the so called faint of heart  i like my coffee with a bit of a strong bold taste i was not disappointed in the least  can t wait for my next cup  enjoy my friends  love it love  ,1,0

2641,there is another brand of cinammon rugalach carried by amazon that is much better tasting than this brand  maybe the packaging from this purveyor is part of the problem  a simple plastic bag with a tie  the other amazon brand  stern s  comes in a carefully set up plastic box  edible  have had much better,1,0

2659,this is turkish gum  i am living in us but turkish and i missed a lot turkish gum  what is different from regular gums you can find in us or canada is the taste of the gum  it does not include or taste any sugar products  therefore  you can taste the taste of gum not sugar  this is really good for teeth  i strongly recommend you to taste it  turkishgum,1,0

2657, this date sugar is cheaper if you order 4 bags at a time  that s what i always do   now foods date sugar   16 ounce bags  pack of 4 i ordered this date sugar because i had a recipe for gaps legal brownies that called for 2 3 4 c  date sugar  the first time i made the recipe i bought dates and put them in my food processor  i didn t realize you re supposed to dry them in the dehydrator first  so i ended up with a huge sticky ball of very sticky date  sugar  that i used  some portions of the date got stuck in the sticky  sticky ball of stickiness without totally being blended so i got little chunks of date in my brownies  i had trouble blending the sticky date ball with the butter and cocoa  and it was tough to mix into the rest of the recipe  it wasn t the end of the world  and the brownies were good  but the texture was a little off so  i ordered this date sugar and i ve made the brownies again   one package is exactly the amount the recipe calls for    holy smokes  it was so much easier  instead of buying this date sugar  you could buy a bunch of dates  dry them out in a dehydrator  and put them in a food processor  i won t do that again though  because that takes a bunch of time  and it cost me more to use dates from the store than it cost to buy this already turned into date sugar the texture of this date sugar is uniform enough that it works well in recipes  but the color and size of the granules varies enough that you know it comes from real food instead of being some sort of chemical product  the date sugar is quite sweet  and very easy to work with i will definitely continue to buy this date sugar  wonderful  great for gaps diet ,1,0
2656,i have no idea whether the dreamfield claims are true regarding the magic blackbox way to block carb uptake    as a chemical engineer and knowing a small amount about slight molecular changes in artificial sweeteners that prevent uptake  it seemed feasible      the nih did a study where it showed the same glycemic response as regular pasta and i have not seen an independent report supporting the dreamfield claims    but since the pasta is not much more expensive than other pastas and since it tastes just as good as other pastas  cooking the same  having the same texture  etc   i am giving it four stars for at least the creative marketing i would not  however  want my diabetic sister to start eating it if her trust is based on their claims   it is like getting my children baptised  though it is speculative whether the claimed benefits are true    there is no real downside for the small chance that the claims are  in fact  true i just purchased another six boxes   i treat them as if i am eating regular pasta   if i want what i feel is a real healthy no carb replacement  i use shirataki    to which there is no doubt about the benefits and content but it is also clear that it is not regular pasta  just like regular pasta,1,0
2655,for the most part  these are what you d want in pistachios  they arrive fresh and tasty  for a little lower price than the local store i d estimate about 5 10  of the nuts are not opened  and get trashed  another 10  get opened with some fingernail prying and pulling pretty hard they re pretty salty  which isn t ideal  but right where i d expect a normal salted pistachio  great for some who like salty and too much for others however  there s one bug in the product   literally  i think two of the last three bage had one nut each where the nut had a bug   work  whatever it was   inside the shell if you re on the couch munching watching tv  not looking at the nuts you open and eat  it d be very easy to have eaten it  it s disgusting i contacted the manufacturer  and they explained  they try but it s not practical to avoid   they re not the only brand   my last bag  and i mean last bag  over a year ago  didn t buy after  had the same thing  good pistachios  but one bug in the product,1,0
2642,stuffed in a box with peanuts  i still wonder how it survived  but  it did  bent  because the pot was not attached to the box anywhere  it came alive and is starting to straighten out  except for the one small broken top branch  it is vibrant green  and even better than i expected  except for the dirt everywhere  thx   i recommend that the seller learn how to wire the pot to the bottom inside flaps  it is not difficult   as this would achieve arrival of a perfect plant  how did it survive   ,1,0
2654,i have this for breakfast almost every day and buying in bulk saves a good chunk of change  i love this cereal its low in sugar and high fiber  beware that amazon third party warehouses do not have good quality control  this has a 12 month shelfi ve but yet several i received expired in 6 months  the product was made in january and sat in some warehouse for 6 months then it was shipped to me  the 15lbs usually s consumed within  9 10 months  i set my subscribe and save to 6 months then after 5 months update the next shipment to 5 moths from that date  watch the expiration date   ,1,0

2650,i have to say  i did not have high expectations for this tea   first off  i despise fennel  anise and anything that taste like them   however  this tea does not have an offensive licorice taste   i recommend sweetening with honey or sugar   i would also recommend making iced tea with it   overall  i m pleased with the results and the taste  not as bad as i expected ,1,0
2649,this jam is quite tasty and  like many other people who consume it  i choose it rather than a normal type of jam because it is lower in calories  however  i don t deceive myself that it won t raise blood sugar  yes  this jam is  as the label states   sweetened only with fruit juice   however  any jam which is not made with artificial sweeteners  which this one is not  inevitably derives the vast majority of its calories from some type of sugar  because of this  the sweetener will appear first in the ingredient list  as is the case with this jam   juice concentrate  pear  grape   raspberries  maltodextrin  dietary fiber   fruit pectin  citric acid  natural flavor  this product is essentially almost 100  fructose because polaner has substituted fructose for sucrose as a sweetener and it also is made from whole raspberries  this is a reduced calorie jam because  since fructose is twice as sweet as sucrose  the producers only need to use half as much of it as they would have of sucrose  meaning that this jam has about half the calories of regular jam if you have never had this jam before and are used to regular jam  this jam may taste different to you and initially you may think it isn t quite as sweet  to my own taste  though  since i m used to eating this brand of fruit spread  it tastes quite sweet enough to me as stated above  this product contains no artificial sweeteners of any kind  virtually every artificial sweetener ever sold to the public has been associated with health hazards  including the most serious one of all  cancer  and less serious but quite aggravating problems such as headaches  allergies  brain fog  and digestive problems  this jam also contains no high fructose corn syrup  hfcs  which is currently the principle sweetener in processed foods in the united states  fructose that occurs naturally in fruit  which is what is used in this jam  is one constituent of a whole food that has many other healthy nutrients within it  such as potassium  calcium  phosphorus  magnesium  manganese  and zinc  in contrast  the fructose in hfcs is made from a chemical process  not only is the fructose stripped entirely from the corn it used to be part of  it now contains unnatural chemicals as well  so nothing healthy remains for the body to utilize to nourish itself  in addition  when hfcs is consumed  it cannot be digested in the small intestines as fructose from fruit can  instead  the liver has to process hfcs  the liver turns it into triglycerides which cause two main  interrelated health problems  they either are immediately stored by the body as unnecessary fat  leading to obesity  or they clog the arteries  which promotes heart disease and cancer  in addition  digesting hfcs is harmful to the liver  one of the most vital organs in the body though this low cal product has sidestepped those two main issues  i do have a couple of health advisories about it for consumers  first  since the fruit pectin in this product is a standard thickener in jellies and jams and its own natural form of fiber  i am not sure why polaner opted to add in maltodextrin and call that  fiber  too  anyone with a gluten intolerance should be wary of this product because of the maltodextrin since some people with gluten intolerance are getting sick from the maltodextrin in this jam  the producers claim on the label it is  gluten free   but maltodextrin can be made from either wheat or corn  and apparently this company is not being careful enough about contamination with gluten a second problematic ingredient is its  natural flavor   it is possible that the producers have added raspberry extract  a chemically derived substance that has a taste similar to real raspberries  in order to get away with using less real raspberries  which are more expensive than flavoring  the definition of natural flavor under the code of federal regulations is   the essential oil  oleoresin  essence or extractive  protein hydrolysate  distillate  or any product of roasting  heating or enzymolysis  which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice  fruit or fruit juice  vegetable or vegetable juice  edible yeast  herb  bark  bud  root  leaf or similar plant material  meat  seafood  poultry  eggs  dairy products  or fermentation products thereof  whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional   21cfr101 22   that essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food  but the process by which it is derived is anything but  natural   and shrouded in purposeful mystery so that the consumer is lulled into believing a product containing it is far more healthy than it actually is  delicious taste  but you pay a premium to substitute fructose for sucrose,1,0
2648,there s nothing i didn t really expect in the pears  they re the quality i expect  similar to any other canned pears   mostly halves  some smaller pieces  a forgettable sugary water a few of the pieces had a little spot that seemed to be from the skin not quite being removed   nothing disgusting about it  the reason for ordering   and i re ordered  a decent price for a case brought to my door  what you d expect  decent pears in a  heavy sauce ,1,0

2662,i added just 2 drops  very carefully  to an ordinary batch of hormel chili with meat and beans fresh from the microwave and i could sense something was not right  every bite was more uncomfortable as the last but i was prepared with a gallon of whole milk  i did finish the chili but my eyes were watering and there was a spicy aftertaste of something new  i am used to the texas pete  tobasco  and franks on anything i eat  i even douse hard times xxx habanero sauce over chili and chicken wings but i could not imagine adding more than 2 drops of blair s per 16 ounces of whatever is to be consumed  one whiff of a freshly opened bottle is as satisfying as huffing paint thinner  it burns and i wouldn t be surprised if it also kills brain cells too  what s scary is there is hotter stuff like blairs 2 and 3 am  but even as a hot sauce head i am afraid to try anything higher octane than this stuff  just the sawce i was looking for,1,0

2591,   a natural sweetener that taste great with no aftertaste  i ve tried plain stevia and the ones that are a blend of stevia with other sweeteners  and i still can t get past the aftertaste  i ve been buying  ideal  but it s still not  all natural  nectresse is just what i ve been looking for  i do need 1 1 2 packets to feel the sweetness in my coffee  but that s not a problem for me   i only wish it would come in 100 count  instead of 40  finally   ,1,0
2589,i give this 5 stars for it s what it purports to be  i don t like to rate on personal taste   i have seen some describe these as a combination of dried cranberry and raisin   to me it s a combination between a dried cranberry and a rose hip   since the healthy daily requirement is only 15 bits  it s easy to just eat them as they are out of the bag  research gogi berries using google and you will be impressed with its laundry list of health benefits i tried putting these in cereal and they don t absorb liquids readily  even if left to soak  i found that the taste is more preferable straight out of the bag  for me it did not  add  to the flavor of my oatmeal  they may be better in a granola with other dried fruits  i bought the large bag so i will to eat a handful every day until they are gone  unless i ve developed a taste for them by the end of this large bag  i don t know that i will purchase them again  enjoy the health benefits  gogi super food ,1,0
2585,these are my favorite chocolate covered cherries they are good sized  not small  the chocolate is soft  it s a milk chocolate  but not like most milk chocolate  i normally prefer dark  but prefer these to the dark chocolate covered cherries  it has a great taste  a chocolate not like the  cherry covered cordials  cheap chocolate  cherry coridals have a liquid filling  these do not it has a silky taste and texture  the chocolate melts when you eat it  if you think you might like it  i suspect you will one note  the pricing here  these are the same item available for half the price   5 49  at trader joe s   while theyr e two for  21 00 on current pricing here  not to mention almost that much again for shipping  very good item  give it a try  the best chocolate covered cherries,1,0

2580,this powdered stevia is comparable in quality to other brands i have tried  like other no  or low calorie sweeteners  stevia is extremely concentrated  so the envelope contains other substances as well  in this case organic agave inulin and silica  each envelope contains a little over a half teaspoon of powder in all each packet claims to sweeten  like 2 tsp  of sugar   however  i found it to be comparable to one teaspoon of sugar while the agave inulin and stevia are organic and this may attract some buyers  in my opinion  truvia natural sweetener  300 count package has a more sugar like taste  that being said  i strongly prefer sweetleaf steviaclear liquid stevia  4 ounce bottles  pack of 2   this form of stevia is more economical and a more palatable sweetener than any powdered stevia brand for any buyers who are new to stevia  i recommend using this in foods  but not in drinks  stevia always tastes odd to me in beverages  though it may be that one can become accustomed to its unusual taste aftertaste in time  comparable in taste to other powdered stevia brands,1,0
2579,i was really concerned that this water would have a weird or salty taste to it  but nope   it tastes just like water    probably closer to dasani than to poland spring  and nothing like evian  not surprising  since the label indicates they use reverse osmosis to do the purification  which is what dasani does  most surprisingly  there really is something to the  silky smooth taste   it s not purely marketing   whether from the high ph or something else  this is just good water    that said  i don t necessarily feel better hydrated than i would with regular water  regarding the health claims of alkali water  ymmv   to their credit  essentia doesn t really make any of the claims on the bottle  but google them or look them up on other products here on amazon   some people are hard core believers  some think they re bunk   i am not really qualified to give a real scientific judgement on them  but i started looking into alkaline water after reading the paleo diet  lose weight and get healthy by eating the foods you were designed to eat   there s an interesting rant in the book about the acid base balance in the body  in short  the contention is that lots of grains lead to the body being to acidic and an acidic body is bad    the suggestion there is basically to eat lots of vegetables  but my immediate thought was  why not just drink alkaline water    i have no idea of the answer if you re curious  the plastic bottle is a pete 1   also  these are 1 5 litre bottles  which are quite big  tastes like water   very good water ,1,0
2578,my wife loves this water   i have tried it and to me it is very underflavored  but she likes it really well if you want a water with lots of taste  don t buy this   but if you just want a  hint  of flavor  you will probably like this water  not overpowering flavor  but   ,1,0
2577,i tried this coffee because the price simply can not be beat   we are not coffee experts by any means but we love a good solid brew   the coffee has the right balance of strength with a mellow aftertone   the only thing that i have found less than stellar is the exploding cups   in a batch of 36 we ve had 9 explode on us   when you look at the cost per cup that s coffee that is lost plus the time spent having to thoroughly clean the machine   hopefully the exploding cup issue has been resolved  decent brew  exploding cups,1,0

2574,this toy seems well made  which is important for my puppy who is a powerful chewer and destroyer  sometimes  though  the base can be difficult to screw back on after filling it with kibble i have used the toy with my 8 month old  medium sized dog 3 times now  putting her kibble meal inside instead of treats  the first time she used it  she was frustrated and confused  and my mom just gave her the food inside after a while  the second time  i was with her and constantly encouraged her but didn t touch the toy  she got all of the kibble out except for a few pieces after significant efforts  she eventually discovered a way of manipulating it  tipping the jar upside down to stand on the narrow neck  that was most successful  the kibble came out many pieces at a time instead of just one piece at a time  which was happening often before  the third time  i barely watched her  and she had the food out pretty quickly  she started to get really frustrated with the toy  wanting more kibble to come out  i examined the toy  and there wasn t a single kibble left  this surprised me that she was so quick  but a similar thing happened when i introduced her to the kong  it was quite hard the first time  but  after that  she seemed to have easy success  easier than i expected,1,0
2573,this bagged dry dog food  presents  very nicely       no disagreeable dog food odor  visible chewy meat and vegetable nuggets  and apparently an excellent taste that dogs enjoy we normally feed our jack russell and chihuahua using a feeder that allows them access to food 24 7   however  with this chef michael s grilled siroin dry dog food  i m forced to ration it out in suitable serving sizes to each dog to prevent overeating  the same routine i would use for table scraps    notwithstanding the overfeeding caution  i trust purina  the maker of chef michael s  as a reputable pet food manufacturer and have no concerns with nutritional or health issues here   combine that with the apparent great taste and this is a 5 star product in my opinion if i may add further opinion regarding the quality of this product and the variety of reviewer responses    i see that many reviewers took issue with the ingredients list  finding most of the ingredients to be inferior  undesirable  or harmful   i guess i m a bit more economically frugal in my views   as this is a relatively expensive dog food  i don t mean frugal price wise  but rather resource wise   of course by product meats and some vegetable filler  which does have nutritional benefit  are used   i find it acceptable and even expected that the meat and fat products used in this dog food would come from animals that are in part legally unsuitable for humans   although in other parts of the world they would be consumed by humans   in fact  nothing in the animal slaughter industry goes to waste and the ingredients in this pet food product are far from the bottom of that usage ladder   unacceptable are the synthetic pet food products such as we have imported from china that have actually killed our pets or ruined their kidneys   acceptable  in my opinion  are pet foods  such as this chef michael s branded product  made by a reputable experienced manufacturer using by products and vegetable products known as suitable for pets anecdotally  i recall growing up on a farm where our labrador loved to kill and eat groundhogs       it sometimes took a few days to finish one       in the summer   burying didn t help  as she would dig them up   anyway   the dog loved the disgusting decaying groundhogs  which would have violated pet food laws and sensitivities on many fronts   she lived long and healthy   and happy  both of my dogs love it,1,0
2581,i tasted this product rather than a baby because there is no better way for me to try it   i really thought it was wonderful   it has a very pleasant taste and it is made from organic ingredients   i think this is a product that your baby will like and you can feel good about giving it to them   i also really like the containers  although i can see where the lid could be a potential choking hazard if not careful great ,1,0
2616,i got these thinking they were cat treats  but i guess they are for both dogs and cats  which is a good thing  because my cat did not like them at all they are kind of big for a cat  so i broke it up into smaller pieces  but my cat just took a few sniffs and walked passed it  so then i gave one to my dog  if he loves something  he will eat it immediately  barely taking time to chew it  if he does not like something he will go bury it and never bother eating it  if it s questionable  he plays with it for a few minutes  then either eats it or buries it  for this treat  he played with it for a few minutes  he did his little puppy dance  bum up in the air  then poking his head at the treat a few times  totally funny to watch  then he decided to eat it  so i d say it s not his favorite  but he decided they aren t bad  my dog liked my cat did not,1,0
2595,i received my beans in a day because i live in boston and the company is located in charlestown  i ve ordered from olive nation  jr mushrooms and specialties  several times and have yet to be disappointed  this time was no different  the beans were so plump  juicy and beautifully fragrant  i couldn t be happier with them or more excited to use them  look forward to doing business with them again  oh  and the price  you re not going to find better  with the 20 percent off coupon code  they re 12 dollars on their website and you still get free shipping  i ll buy more beans today with the code  only down side is that i used to be able to find tahitian vanilla through them as well  but there seems to be some kind of a shortage or problem with getting them from  not just olive nation  but a lot of places now  not their fault at all  i was just saddened about not being able to find the quality beans i ve been spoiled with by olive nation in both madagascar and tahitian varieties  incredible ,1,0
2597,there is nothing real special about the higgins   burke english breakfast black tea as it s not bad but it s not special either  the flavor of the tea is reminiscent of most breakfast teas  but i would not say it s as bracing as some other breakfast teas i ve tried overall  i d recommend this tea  especially if you are looking for a less bracing cup of breakfast tea  not bad   ,1,0
2613,i received this product accidentally when i ordered a case of natrataste  not from amazon    as it turns out  i like this product a lot better and it s not as expensive as the natrataste brand  better than natrataste,1,0
2612,it should probably be called lemongrass mint to more accurately describe the taste   it s especially good as ice tea  but drinking it hot is enjoyable too   the mint taste is not as strong as the lemongrass   i notice that some reviewers here say they barely taste the lemongrass  while others think it overwhelms the mint   it s a good idea to buy a box of this tea to try it out before ordering 6 boxes   i usually drink bigelow plantation mint black tea  so i m accustomed to a strong mint flavor   lucky for me that i like lemongrass too  so the balance of lemongrass and mint was not a problem for me  lemongrass and mint,1,0
2611,most soy sauce is from japan but they are having problems with radiation in their soy bean fields  i am not sure how long the contamination will last  i like the idea this product claims no gmo seeds  yea  you pay more but decided not to take a chance on japan  non gmo,1,0
2610,i first tried galil green manz olive 12 15   20  extra  22 8 ounce cans  pack of 6  and loved them   although these pitted ones cost about a dollar more  i thought it d be nice to have a stash of them on hand for those times i want to use olives in a dish  since the others contain pits    unfortunately  the shipped package  which had a couple other small items in it  arrived totally beat up  one end of the shipping box had been completely ripped open and then taped shut  inside  the olives cans were all dented but one   weirdest of all  a roll of toilet paper was stuck inside the box too  no  i had not ordered any toilet paper  all i can figure is somewhere along the way  perhaps when the box had busted open because the olives weren t properly immobilized by amazon  somebody thought to use the roll as packing material   nice   insert eye roll the salvaged good can  wonderful  these olives are just grand  so fresh  with good texture  not mushy at all   i like to rinse them in water before use  to cut down on the salt amazon is replacing the olives   the promised one day shipping has turned into a week  so i will post an edit when they arrive   i am hoping since no other reviewer mentioned dented cans as a problem  that maybe my experience was a fluke edit  3 of 6 cans in the replacement order  which was packaged much better  had dents  two significant enough to throw out  dents near seams are considered particularly hazardous in canned goods    this time it looked like dents were in the cans  before  shipping   disappointing  olives 5  shipping 1,1,0

2607,i was expecting whole peanuts and was disappointed when i received 10 lbs of broken peanuts wrapped in 2 layers of large plastic bags   the superior nut company said they did not have any whole organic peanuts but this kind   they were willing to refund me if i still had the original whole package   if you want to purchase this item  do not believe what you see in the product picture   the peanuts that i got tasted fresh and sweet  but they looked like leftovers  make sure that you get what you intend to get before order this product  fresh  flavorful  but all broken up in halves,1,0
2596,we really like this bread  it reminds us of our years in europe  i order it frequently  this time 1 package was all moldy  it was more trouble than it was worth to return the whole lot of it so we just threw away the 1 package and moved on  i will still order it again  one was moldy,1,0

2604,these were a big hit with rexie but after awhile he lost interest   then this week i noticed a rancid odor and since it has been over 2 months opened  it must have gotten stale   i will store future bags in our refrigerator   this is a great idea for much of his food since the moths form quite rapidly at room temperature in many of his snacks etc  i suggest storing in refrigerator after opening,1,0
2603,i was very disappointed when i found out that lipton had discontinued its  mango mandarin  flavored green tea   i used to buy five boxes at a time when i would go grocery shopping   i d keep some at home and bring some to work   a few months ago  maybe even a year ago  that i went grocery shopping i thought they had just ran out but i was told that they had discontinued it   i hate that   i hope they realize that many people like it and want it back on the shelves  disappointed   ,1,0
2602,we ve had this door for over a year and a half now  and it has worked well the whole time   it s a bit noisy  not too bad  but i wouldn t want to be trying to sleep too near it   also  be aware that a six foot man can get through the opening   we had paramedics come to the house with an incorrect address for a call   our dogs happily escorted one of them to the door  it opened  and he was able to crawl in and look for the victim  otherwise  the door is locked from the outside and it would take considerable noise and effort to get it open   anyway  i d buy this again   i ll write a separate review for the collars receivers  but the short version is  don t bother with the  even  more expensive version  good dog door,1,0
2601,this 33 8 once bottle is the larger of the two sizes offered by ribena   the bottles are made of plastic  so they won t break in transport and four of them are packed into a bag   however  unlike the traditional glass ones i had  the black currant in these plastic bottles don t seem as concentrated as past ribena black currant   maybe ribena has changed the concentration level because these bottles require a lot more currant to water ratio to be sweet  so i ve had to pour more currant for the same amount of water to get the complete taste of a ribena drink   i have to say that i love ribena s black currant and i miss it   the price has gone up in chinese supermarkets for ribena  used to be  4  6 per bottle  now  9  14 per bottle   and i found amazon offers better pricing if you subscribe to the frequent purchase deal  plastic bottles and less concentrated,1,0
2600,well  i don t claim to be a tea expert  my basis for comparison is lipton s orange pekoe and black tea  which i drink regularly and like  so  this tea i judge as just as good and perhaps a touch better  a bit richer  and  it does seem to dissolve fast  maybe a testament to its richness  so  between the two  i prefer this  but not enough to change because of the cost and what i judge as only marginally better with regard to its naturalness claim  its claim for being ethically produced  i think worthy  but really can t judge and i haven t heard anything bad about lipton s processes  that said  if its cost is not important to the buyer and or its claim of ethics is important enough  i recommend this because i judge it a superior tea based on what i like  as described in this review  i m pleased,1,0
2599,i got this for the crawl space under my parents cabin   i wanted something safe for when the kids are playing  but strong enough to chase away critters   my parents are mostly concerned about skunks and the occasional groundhog or woodchuck the odor is strong and peppery  but much better than skunk spray   i think you have to stay on top of applciations because the damp soil earth will probbaly reduce the potency so far so good and it seems to be doing its job   i wish it were a little less expensive  but then again professionals are much more expensive  very good,1,0
2598,i ve used this on several occasions on both carpet and furniture  to remove pet vomit  cat  and feces urine dog    it worked 100  on both teh smell and stain  especially with a repeat application for the worst offender   smell is clean and very strong but fades after a day or two into a pleasant fresh smell  it really does work,1,0
2605,okay  i m rating these based on my cats  reactions to these treats  while one is the exact opposite of a picky eater  anything that is remotely edible that hits the floor is fair game in her mind   the other is a lot more finicky when it comes to snacks   needless to say  the feline garbage can literally inhaled these treats and was looking for more   cat  2 took a little more time investigation when it came to the treat  that or she just likes for the other cat to be tormented while being held back from snatching up the treat as she sniffs at it for a minute  something i really don t put past her   but once she tried it  she was much quicker eating the second bite   finding a treat that both cats enjoy and is made of seemingly healthy ingredients less crappy filler is a great thing that said  these things are not cheap   you do not get a lot for your money  though at least if you re buying them for cats   you can break up the round treats to share them among several cats or get a couple of feedings out of one piece  i can see these being more of a special occasion snack than an every day thing   at least while on the current budget  they don t last long    ,1,0
2664,i know that artificial is artificial and that aspartame is probably only slightly worse for you than sucralose  splenda  but i think from now on i will purchase powdered drinks with sucralose don t get me wrong  it s a great tasting iced tea and i drank a lot of it  i just want to cut back on aspartame  great tasting just hate aspartame,1,0

2666,this tea is just like the caffeinated kind   it seriously doesn t taste any different to me   my dad and i love lipton instant tea but we get kidney stones quite often and caffeine only fuels kidney stones so i have scoured many grocery stores in search for a  decaffeinated  lipton tea only to find the nasty  putting it politely  decaf nestea   no decaf lipton anywhere   i finally found this on amazon and was so excited   i hoped it would be like the regular caffeinated lipton instant tea and it was a true pleasure when it arrives and i tasted it for the first time   not a thing tasted different from the caffeinated kind   i purchased two packs of 3 for me and my dad to split and now i m about to buy more as i have already used up almost all three bottles   lol   anyhow  if you are fearful of decaf instant tea because you tried others and were very disappointed  try this kind  you won t be sorry that you did   i bet you ll come back for more all the time like i plan to      excellent  doesn t taste like nestea s nasty decaf ,1,0
2736,my 13wk old mastiff puppy loves these  i ve already ordered two mainly because she runs off and chews on them under the beds then i can t find it later when i want her to stop chewing on people  the price wasn t bad for me  12 i think for the med  i think that is mild in comparision to all the other chew toys i ve bought that she wont even look at  the antlers dont smell and she has been chewing on one for about a month and it has barely made a dent  as long as she continues to be a chewer  i will always reccomend these  puppy loves it,1,0
2735,the grain was very fresh  the main problem was that i did not realize it was not the flour but the whole grain   i had to find someone to grind it for me   the bread was great and the rise was nice and high  it had a fresh wheat taste   the next time i would be sure to order the flour  organic wheat berries,1,0
2734,usually when i drink coffee i brew at home  flavored and non flavored   i am compelled to add a good amount of cream and sugar in order to enjoy it  this coffee  however  is different  i actually drink it black and truly enjoy the flavor  it has a phenomenal aroma that lasts for the duration of the bag  amazon  however  is charging too much for new england coffee  it is 30  cheaper at the grocery store when the grocery store doesn t have it on sale  amazon    10 bag  grocery    7 bag   and 50  cheaper when it is on sale   5 bag   great tasting coffee  awful price from amazon,1,0
2733,    you have to take this product  quaker stila crispy oat cookie bar   blueberry  5 5 ounce  pack of 6   for what it is   it is not a pop tart  which is bigger and more thoroughly filled with the fruit like substance these two food chunks offer the product under review is airy  more like a small nerf ball than a large marble  although it is in no way spherical or useful in any games   i was surprised that the filling did not fill the shell because the filling does not fill much of the shell much of the shell does not abut anything that s more liquid than solid  like blueberry jam compared to blueberry paste     crumblybecause of that much of the shell is so dry that when you take a bite of the top of it it tends to crumble rather than tear  more like a potato chip than a potao knish now  i m not saying that the typical consumer of this product cannot eventually figure out the exact measures necessary to figuring out how to eat it without spilling crumbles but i am saying there s a reason you don t see the manufacturer  quaker  bragging all the time on how many thousands of these bars they have shipped to the international space station over the years where i m pretty sure weigthlessness and the susceptibility to encroachement by crumbits into the various electronic and mechanical devices is considered more dangerous than that same degree of encroachment in the backseat of your car or even the front seat     packagingthe package of my quaker stila crispy oat cookie bar   blueberry  5 5 ounce  pack of 6  is interesting   when viewed from above  the shape is not a rectangle as you would expect   said another way  the horizontal cross section of the box of almost every such product  and literally millions of others  is a rectangle whereas the cross section of this box is a parallelogram  i e   the opposite sides are parallel but the corners are not square below is my best representation of a parallelogram  where you should observe the only the stars and not the dots  but it might not turn out right in the final version of this amazon review   if it doesn t ignore it                                                                                  this is interesting because the curious mind wants to know why this package is different from so many others   there must be a reason the experienced and highly paid people at quaker made such an unusual decision   i claim it s for one of two reasons  but it if you learn that it s for some other reason  i hope you ll take the ime to leave a comment it s either because the package s odd shape was expected somehow to attract more buyers than if it were rectangular or because the shape somehow protects the bars inside from getting crushed as much during packaging and transport and shipping i think it s the latter  because when the box is on a shelf in a store it looks from the front like all the others   not until you see it from the side or the top do you realize it s not rectangular as  as i say  so many other of its shelfmates are i am not enough of an engineer to undertand exactly why this parallelogram shape would prevent the individual bars from getting crushed from the bottom big surface up more significantly or from the top big surface down more significantly but i m convinced that s the best explanation     this product did pass my hungry dog test in the sense that pheyeg hdeaux ate every little crumb or chunk i dropped onto the floor where he eagerly watched me eat the bar   my dog is always really quite extremely eager to eat anything that might possibly be food   he will happily partake of cat poop and dead squirrel and even broasted plamplams   it s not much to say that this food product  quaker stila crispy oat cookie bar   blueberry  5 5 ounce  pack of 6   passes this test  but the fact remains that it does it probably also goes without saying  but when you duct tape one of these bars to a stick of dynamite and detonate it  the bar is entirely disintegrated and no identifiable pieces remain within a radius of 10 yards  including any blueberries despite my curiosity about and possible admiration for the box s shape  i award this product only 4 stars  and the reason is its flatulence  by which i mean how flat the filling is relative to the higher top crust of the bar   if you want this  crispy  this is it  but i don t     update of august 10  2012bernadettes s comment got me to thinking there s more to say about the box s extremely uncommon shape one thing is that storing it next to more normally shaped containers in a pantry is slightly more difficult more interesting is that this box has a shape that is perhaps better suited for stowing in  say  a backpack   the height cannot be changed  of course  but if you turn a rectangular prism into this parallelogram you do add to the width  the side to side dimension  but you can shrink the depth  the front to back dimension  significantly  which might well make it fit more easily into certain containers such as a backpack or a motorcycle saddlebag or your kangaroo s pouch and yet another reason is that this shape prevents storing the box on either of its two sides  which is the one orientation of the three that would be most likely to crush the bars inside which  as i ve already said  would result in significant damage to them   if you store the box flat on either large surface or on either end  the damage will be less   i don t know that this is the manufacturer s reason  but it makes sense either way if you can invent yet another reason the box is shaped this way  do leave a comment  crumbly dome,1,0
2732,i recently saw the vita coconut water for sale at costco with a discount of  5 off   even though the final price of the 6l of vitacoco water cost much less than the individual pack that i saw at safeway vons supermarket  i decided to by an individual tetrapak for vitacoco  naked juice  zico  zola  one  and nirvana  no c2o  amy   brian     the test subjects were myself and my two nieces  6   11    they didn t get to drink that much fresh coco water from a real coconut but i sure did  however  they results were similar   my two nieces held on tight to the 17 5oz can of zola and loved it but said that it s a bit sweet   the 6 years old said  yuck  after taking a sip of the vita coconut water  the 11 yo frowned  and i liked it the least also   why did vita add vitamin c to their coco water   i m glad that i spent  2 50 on a small tetrapak than  15 for 6l of vita   we also agreed that one coco water tasted a lot like vita but a bit better   naked followed it   zico was as bad as other reviewers complained on their review on amazon com about the plastic bottle compared to the tetrapak they had before   the last coconut water we had was the nirvana   it went down really smooth and didn t have any after taste like zola and other coco water   imo  i ll always get nirvana   if it s not available  then zola which is rather a good deal because it s a 17 5oz or so for  2 50  but  i wouldn t touch one  naked  and vita ever again i am glad that safeway carries those 5 brands because i was able to do a taste test without buying junk that i don t like and regret it   so  i you want to buy any of the coconut water  go to safeway vons supermarket and buy a little bit of each like i did and test them for yourselves   nirvana is my and my nieces   1 choice and zola is   2 so far  yours might be different   so  experiment  the best so far ,1,0

2729,first  i think this has an odd product assortment  i don t understand the popcorn mixed with the pretzels and the cookies  other than the chocolate drizzle on the popcorn it does not seem like they all fit together the main issue is that the calorie portions are not the same for all three  the popcorn is 130 calorie count while the other 2 are 100 so that is why i knocked off one star the pretzels are the real prize in this assortment they arrived fresh  and even though it has been very hot and humid the chocolate did not come melted   so nabisco really knows how to make a product  love snackwells  but not all the same calorie portions in this,1,0

2747,the cereal is great  obviously i think so since i buy these huge quantities of it from amazon  just a tip  do not assume that you are saving money by buying the big bags of it  yes  the quantity is larger and there is less packaging  which would make you think that you are saving money  but do the math  they way they are currently priced on amazon  it is cheaper to buy the 6 pack of smaller boxes than it is to buy the 6 pack of larger bags  yes  i mean price per ounce  not total price  the pricing is similar in my local food retailer  this may be just fine if you are willing to pay more to save the earth and to have the convenience of not having more cardboard to throw away  but i m not willing to pay more for this privilege  make sure the big bags are cheaper than the smaller boxes ,1,0

2748,ordered this a few weeks ago to replace starbucks  original  breakfast blend  which they have now taken off the market completely and replaced with  medium   whatever that awful stuff is   this level 3 coffee does not taste like breakfast blend  but it has good qualities and more body than breakfast blend   the first few sips are average  but the taste seems to grow the more you drink   it is quite smooth and does not have the burnt taste as the new  medium  bb does  works for me,1,0

2687,i ve had the worst eczema for years  my skin will fall off my pillow and pile up that s how bad it was i ve tried so many things from lotions  cetaphil  cosmetics  steroid creams  olive oil  all these things made my skin worst  this product immediately soothed my dry skin and didn t feel uncomfortable  i ve super sensitive skin and it didn t irritate me at the slightest and it doesn t have unneccessary ingredients like alcohol which dry and sting your skin  i just don t understand how products get away with that  also  i heard there s a bunch of antioxidants and apparently it can even help people with aids  my skin looks years younger and i don t feel bizarre anymore whenever people walk my way or make eye contact with me   i believe if more people knew about this cosmetic companies would run out of business  this is truly a miracle natural product  miracle natural product,1,0
2684,oatmeal is said to lower cholesterol and benefit the heart  that s one thing to like about quaker instant oatmeal  this particular brand    maple   brown sugar    also claims  whole grains  oats  no trans fats  and no high fructose corn syrup that s all good  it also tastes good  heats quickly  and has good consistency whether one uses milk or water yet it s not perfect  it s not as healthful as pure oats  of whatever brand   by which i mean no ingredients other than oats this one contains various  artificial flavors  and chemicals  that includes caramel color  i heard a radio report claiming that some people now believe that caramel color may cause some cancers so check whatever you buy for caramel color  lots of bread and cereal products contain it  in this case  i suppose the caramel color is to help create the  brown sugar  look for this product the ingredients actually list  sugar   but not  brown sugar   maybe it s all the same  but loses its brown color under certain conditions  hence  the use of caramel color this is still a mostly healthful  and tasty product  but look for oats with nothing other than oats if you want the oats  maximum health benefits if you still prefer buying one of quaker s  flavored  instant oatmeals  i suggest one of the cinnamon flavored ones  cinnamon is said to stabilize blood sugar levels and help prevent adult onset diabetes  cinnamon is more healthful than brown sugar  tasty and mostly healthful  but beware the caramel color,1,0
2683,i bought this from the omaha website and was unable to write a review there so i am writing it here i have purchased from omaha and amazon many times and this was me second chateaubriand  the first was outstanding just like everything from omaha in the past but this second chateaubriand was not up to par  first the taste was not the same and it was not nearly as tender as the first  i will buy again but i hope for better results  thanks for reading  poor consistancy,1,0
2682,this conditioner feels different to me than other conditioners   let me explain cheap conditioners go on slick but rinse off completely and my hair is left a tangled mess expensive conditioners  like tresemme or loreal or pantene  go on slick and leave a certain amount of slickness in and my hair is way more manageable  but you always wonder about the residue left behind this conditioner doesn t really go on so slickly  and it washes away completely    and my hair is left somewhere in between the two other examples    not quite so tangled but not totally tangle free   i have to add detangler when the shower is complete    i have very long  fine  curly wavy hair  the packaging would seem to indicate this product is more for a scalp treatment and not focused as much on the hair though   but the conditioner has a nice feel to it and a nice light scent i still think although i like the no residue feeling that i am so  conditioned  pardon the pun to like the slick feeling and no tangles that that is what my preference is even though i don t like the residue in my hair   it s hard to break old habits edit   i am now down to the last 1 3 of the bottle and i am having difficulty getting the product out   this is a design flaw of the bottle i think   the bottle is really thick and hard to squeeze it   there isn t a good way to take the cap off either i should note that i also got a bottle of shampoo from the same manufacturer and although this bottle of conditioner did not leak in transport   the shampoo did leak   something to note if that is a concern   the leak was not much but it was a hassle to clean up  feels different than other conditioners   rinses clean ,1,0

2689,i worked in the pet food industry for 13 years as a nutrition specialist my job was to research the market for trends break down nutrition and work in a team to create formulations based on digest ability and work on points of interest for sales teams i also worked on the sales teams for 6 out of the 13 years in the field as inside sales so i m well informed on the in and outs of how the industry works  looking at a ingredient label the first 4 ingredients make up 95  of the product while minerals etc are important what is the most important out of every thing else is the protein  your dog and cat have not evolved over time to digest grain or vegetables so protein is the number one ingredient you are looking for in a food and there are several different types used while a lot of companies try and put a marketing spin on shapes colors and brightly target advertising on vegetables and fruits which are targeted more at the people not the dogs or the cats dogs and cats can not break down vegetable protein as well as meat they do no get enough out of it  and despite what common sense tells you do not want a whole protein in a dry food because through the baking process water is removed and you only end up with a faction of the mass it started out as so in a first ingredient you want a protein meal not counting by products and it is not that by products are bad it s just that they include a lot of bones and cartilage that take away from the actual protein that you are looking for  a protein meal simply means concentrated source of protein with water removedif you have a protein meal in the first ingredient and then say ingredient 3 or 4 is a byproduct meal that is okay because the main source of protein is a more pure source no matter what dry food you get you need a grain as a binder to hold it all together and over the years there has been a huge amount of attention on corn while not all for nothing corn or any grain should never be a main ingredient of the source of the food it is cheaper than rice and not nearly as digestible there are different types usedcorn gluten simply means the hard outer shell removed which means its mainly a vegetable protein source with very few minor minerals  which is usually used as a protein filler or binder or both the level on the ingredient list depicts what is it used for in the formulation if it is in the main ingredients the first 4 it s a protein filler to boost protein levels which is essentially adding false readings on the nutritional label usually found in foods high in byproduct mealsground yellow corn is the most common and has not had the hard outer shell removed which is used as a filler and binder also reduces the digest in the animalash you want very low ash content in any food source it will raise the ph balance of the urine causing spots in your yard but most importantly causing urinary tract infections in dogs also but cats are very susceptible to thisany way on to my review of this food this is what i use for my cats it is a reasonably priced food that borders on the good and the bad but more to the good while not the best there is on the market  working in the industry for far to many years i can not bring myself to buy over priced foods when there are decent options out there like this one  like i said i worked in the industry and i know how it works in pet stores you walk in and the  best foods  are closer to the front door and this is not because they are the best those company s buy those spots on the shelf and at the end of the day every single employee has been bought also by the company they work for in that pet store  i used to train those employees in those stores  propaganda  it s not that the company with the big white bag is the best  those veterinarians had there schooling paid for by that company information is so convolutedit s not that corn is bad for your dog or cat it s how it was processed and how it is implemented in the formula  your bag of food says farm raised chicken well so is foster farms  we only use white meat  what makes that better than dark meat   is it the price does it taste better to your dog   no of course not     yogurt   when it is the 19th ingredient on the list how much do you think is in the bag  and in the wild how much yogurt did your dog eat  it s all marketing you can achieve the same effect as yogurt for a upset stomach with oatmeal and it is much cheaper the point in my rant here is to educate and make you think there is a science and once you know it every thing becomes more clear there is no reason to break the bank and don t believe the hype just because they work for a pet store does not mean they are a know all have a great day   don t follow hype read for more,1,0

2672,this is not  puppy food     that is to say  it is not branded or sold by nutrisource as quote puppy unquote food in fact  while large print on the package says  adult dogs   this food is perfectly suitable for puppies  and nutrisource say this in the smaller print of the packaging  it s certainly not part of the branding  nutrisource do not currently make any such thing as  grain free chicken  food specifically for puppies that said    this is the same food as the small bag  with  confusingly  a quite different looking packaging  of kibble our breeder sent us home with when we adopted our little havanese puppy he loves it  he produces a nice stool and has never either been constipated or had diarrhea using this formula so  hooray  a very good puppy food that is not  puppy food   somewhat misleading amazon product title,1,0
2671,the clear brand dandruff shampoos seem to be everywhere now  they use pyrithione zinc to control dandruff  similar to other brands  but cost a bit more in my experience  if they work the same for dandruff control  then they can only differentiate themselves in fragrance  texture  and cleaning fragrancetypical dandruff shampoos smell medicinal  but not bad  more expensive shampoos often have really strong invigorating smells like mint  this shampoo  dry scalp   with a price between the two extremes  has a floral fragrance that reminds me of cheap children s perfume and lingers all day  it is not terrible  but i think a simple  clean  smell would be much better   the  clear men  shampoos have a nicer smell  which would work well for both men and women texturethe texture is much like lotion  but it lathers well cleaningthe shampoo left my hair feeling clean  but it might be a bit heavy for some people   it reminds me of a shampoo conditioner overallclear scalp   hair dry scalp shampoo is a good shampoo for women who have very dry hair   it would be particularly valuable during the winter   apart from the cheap floral fragrance  i think it is a good value  heavy floral shampoo,1,0
2670,my son has celiac but loves pancakes  ive tried every gf mix i could find in stores  every pancake is flat  almost doughy in the middle  to the point it doesnt even look cooked  but my son always eat it and never complains  just a week ago i found maple grove mix  when i first mixed it i noticed it smelled like cake batter  the first pancake i cooked i burnt it and set it aside on a plate to throw away  while i was making the 2nd my son walked over  tore a piece off and started to eat it  i said  dont eat that its no good  its burnt    as kids are  he didnt listen and popped it into his mouth  to my surprise he said  its fine  it tastes good  i did notice while i was making him new pancakes they looked fluffy  like real pancakes  and they smelled sweet  like i was baking a cake  after i made him a few more pancakes i tore a piece off the burnt one  and with no syrup  tasted  i couldnt believe how good it was  it tasted like a cupcake almost  i drizzled a little syrup on it and ended up eating almost the whole pancake that i was going to toss hands down  this is the best gf mix ive found  im certainly open to trying something else in search of the perfect mix  but i cant see anything else much better than this  i dont have a waffle maker any more  had to throw that out after he was diagnosed with celiac  but i bet it makes great waffles too i know we all have our tastes and preferences  but i cant understand the 1 star ratings on this  especially the ones that say this mix is grainy  mixed properly this is the consistency of cake batter  and who doesnt like cake  best gf pancake mix ive found  and ive tried most,1,0
2669,never open any can of this type with a can opener   the reason for this and why it is stated on the can is very important  you can get metal slivers onto and into the meat if you use a can opener to open the can  never use a can opener    you may have ingested or inhaled a sliver when you had that choking   breathing problem  a sliver of metal could have gotten into your esophagus or larynx causing the problem   i highly doubt it was the meat if the pull tab breaks  just heat the can in some hot water  then take a curved knife and break the seal  then pry and roll the lid back   if you can t pull the tab yourself   get someone else to do it for you  never use a can opener on this type of can  this is why it is stated on the can   any can with a pull top like the soups has the potential to cause metal slivers in the food when using a can opener   they should revert back to the non pull top cans to avoid this problem   what happens is that the can opener cuts a slightly different path from the original scored seam  hence the slivers shear off and fall all over getting into the contents  hey  patricia  a reader  please read     ,1,0
2668,first off  let me say that i am a very experienced tea drinker   i make my own tea blends out of loose leaf teas herbs and because of this i don t often buy boxed teas anymore   when i saw this available in vine though  i figured  why not get some   you can never really have too much tea   plus  plain peppermint is so basic there s no way it could be bad   i mean  it s really hard to screw up peppermint  right well     yes and no   this peppermint tea is okay  i suppose  but i ve had better   that s weird  as i honestly don t know how you can screw up peppermint   the menthol bite is still there  a little   but it just has a blandness to it  and also a bit of an odd aftertaste  almost like it s blended with black tea  even though it isn t according to the ingredients    maybe the tea is a bit old  and that s what s causing it   i don t know  maybe i ve been spoiled by the awesomeness of loose leaf tea   all that being said  this tea is still okay  and if i didn t buy loose leaf tea  i d be fine with it so  do i recommend this tea   well  yes  it s fine   if you aren t the sort who already has a ton of loose leaf tea on hand and just wants some easy individually bagged tea to make a quick cup  i d say this is a fine enough peppermint tea   if you do want to make your own loose leaf tea blends  i d recommend picking up some peppermint and spearmint  as i feel like they are both tastier blended together in tea   if not  then this is a good enough choice for peppermint tea  it s really hard to screw up peppermint   ,1,0

2711,the first time i ever tried matcha  it was almost a brownish green color  which i eventually learned  is not a premium grade   this domatcha was nearly 4x the price  ounce vs  ounce   but the quality is clearly way  way better   not only that  this domatcha tea gives me great energy  without any jitters or feeling spacey  like the other one made me feel i have always been a big starbucks green tea latte kind of guy   i love those things to death   but  the vente would cost me  4 30 every day   even with the very high price tag of this domatcha  i can duplicate the same formula for almost 1 4 the price  and i can also use a sweetener of my choice  which is xylitol   i can keep it low glycemic  organic  and sugar free  and pay a fraction of the starbucks price   it s great my only beef with the domatcha is the packaging   the tin is great  but the tea itself comes in a sealed silver pouch inside  which is very messy   i eventually dumped the tea out of the pouch into the tin  but i probably lost 1 2 to 1 full serving in the process   powder was flying everywhere   perhaps i ll get better at the exchange in time  but that was the only bad thing i have to say about this premium matcha formula i ll definitely be buying again  but perhaps the 2nd harvest one the next time  since it s about 1 2 the price  but still remains organic  i ve only tried 3 kinds of matcha  but very happy with this one ,1,0

2699,commercial descaling products work great    but they re quite expensive  citric acid does the same thing for a fraction of the cost  consider that the leading descaling solutions cost between  0 35 and  1 50 per ounce and this product costs about  0 04 per ounce  directions for an electric coffee maker  after every 25 30 pots of coffee mix 2 ounce  56 grams  of citric acid in 32 34 ounces  1 quart   1 liter  of cold water  stir until completely dissolved  pour it into the water reservoir  start the brewing cycle  and let it run about half way through then stop the brewing process  let it stand for 10 15 minutes then resume the brewing process  finish by running two cycles of fresh water through the machine      directions for an electric hot water kettle  heat one quart of water to the boil and pour into a heat proof pitcher containing 2 3 ounces  56 85 grams  of citric acid  carefully stir until dissolved then pour the hot solution back into the electric kettle  unplugged   let stand for 15 20 minutes then discard solution and rinse with cold water  great for descaling coffe machines  hot water kettles  etc ,1,0
2698,i used this in a few different teas and found it added sweetness  but not the clean taste of sugar actually  i prefer my tea plain  but wanted a vehicle that would allow the stevia flavor to come through like others who have reviewed this product  i have found differences in bitterness in different brands  this one was not bitter  per se  but it still had that echo of  not sugar  that said  if i had to stay away from real maple syrup  my sweetener of choice   i would probably buy this brand the fact it s organic is a plus  though with the tiny amount you eat  i am not sure how crucial that is  sweet  but   ,1,0
2695,there are so many snack foods out there and so many promises with each one   it is often dificult to find one that isn t too heavy on what you should not eat  yet have some satisfaction in taste   we found these snacks to be pretty good   the cracker part was okay  a little flakie perhaps but its flavor wasn t too bad   the blueberry filling was very tasty so that to us over road the cracker part  not bad at 100 cal for one  because one seems to quanch the urge to nibble   we liked them  i m sure we will purchase them  we enjoyed them ,1,0
2694,ok  so it does taste just like a cup of coffee from the starbucks store and unfortunately it is no longer avail for the tassimo machine   i bought the other machine and although now starbucks offers the cups for that machine it does not come close to the taste you get from the tassimo  starbucks coffee or not   but more importantly  what is the reason for the  700 plus tag on these  it s not gold people  it s not a cure for cancer is coffee   unfortunate how there are those who think they can take advantage of others      yes    just like a cup from the store      but,1,0
2693,i like these  over a plate of steamed brocolli  they would probably be good over rice as well  not fishy like sardines  and the mustard sauce is mild and creamy  i like these  over a plate of steamed brocolli,1,0
2960,this works exactly as promised  my coffee was stronger  more full body  and i m not polluting the earth  worth the money better cup of coffee  less waste,1,0
2961,good strong taste and smell from this garlic  i am very pleased  was affordable also  i wont be ordering again i dont think because it doesnt say organic and i am attempting to switch to as much organic as possible  nice,1,0
2962,i have used this product for about a year and it has worked pretty well  i have used it in a basement and an attic because of mouse and squirrel problems  trap and poison control has not been effective  an application  works for about a month  it is strong when spraying it so either wear a mask or hold your breath to avoid irritation and coughing  critter ridder,1,0
2963,pros sour  in fact  the first thing people tell me when they eat these is just that   not too sour  just right flavorful  biting into the orange half of the orange blue raspberry worm is like having someone smash an orange into my mouth  in a good way they smell great  in fact  they filled up the entire room with fruity goodness when i opened the bag 9 pounds is a lot of worms  although the size of the box fooled me cons can melt  i made the mistake of ordering these at the end of june  biiiig mistake  while in the shade of the ups truck  the southern blaze fused them together  good news though  this does not affect the great taste at all beyond how you now have an amorphous blob of fruity fusion  good stuff the abundant smell can make it hard to hide the worms from pesky siblings  swith only 3 kinds of worms  green apple lemon  cherry lemon  and orange blue raspberry   things get boring after a while other thoughts  2 months is the most common subscription period  people  really  that s just not healthy  great  but needs more flavors,1,0
3230,i used to love these  with my only complaint being that they were a tad on the dry side  unfortunately  they changed the recipe last year and now they are just a little better than other cereal bars  the main changes in the ingredients list seem to be that they changed the proportions and no longer include sesame seeds  the changes seem minor  but the taste is noticably worse  i wouldn t have bothered checking the ingredients if i hadn t notice the different taste   oh  the calorie count also went up from 110 to 130  used to be perfect  now just good,1,0
3229,its not the greatest hot chocolate  but for the price you pay its worth it  i prefer godiva s hot chocolate over this any day  however  i ve no issues buying this again for the price  worth the money,1,0
3228,i love mate  in all its forms  i especially love this brand  despite the stems in it  however this is a total and complete rip off for this product  i used to buy the 2 2 kg bags for  6 00 each before i moved to a town with only one specialty tea shop  just wanted the general public to know that if you buy this for this price  you re getting screwed  incredibly overpriced,1,0
3226,i have a question  are these collars with the sensors going to be too big abd bulky for my 6lb dogs   i want to order but am worried the collars will be uncomfortable  for small dogs ,1,0
3224,my dog likes this product   that is most important   it doesn t have a foul odor     the description says you can break it in pieces    you can but it is a bit dry and pieces don t come off in the same size consistently   overall i would recommend  my dog likes it,1,0
3220,i loved the osrki sesame bars  but wanted to try these as they  provide a little more nutrition and saw that another reviewer said they could barely taste any quinoa for the sesame flavor in these  which sounded like a win to me   i wish i could say the same   unlike the sesame bars  these taste like something you eat because it s good for you  and they are a bit harder to chew and stick in my teeth worse   however  they don t taste  bad  exactly  and they do have  more protein  fiber  and calcium than the sesame bars  and i do like that they aren t even as sweet as the sesame bars  since i don t need much sweetness to satisfy me   unfortunately they also have almost twice the fat and a few more calories  although i m sure the fat is the very healthy kind i get the osrki bars to have as a small breakfast to go with my vitamins  and will finish these for that purpose  but i won t be snacking on them outside of that much  i may grow more fond of them as the box wears on  but speaking after having had three or four of them  i probably won t buy this flavor again  i ll return to update that if that changes  not as good as the sesame bars  but good for me ,1,0
3217,used this flavoring with pre made lip balm base  with no seperation  flavor held up  no graininess or clouding  not sticky  didn t burn off  and smelled great too  used in lip balm,1,0
3231,i bought this product to replace the packages of powdered cocoa mix  several brands  that i found where making me feel unwell  i checked ingredient s on those packages which had a list of as many as 26 additives chemicals etci am a big fan of ghirardelli chocolates and eat it almost exclusively so the logical solutions was to try their hot cocoa   i am very happy with the taste and price and the more and fewer natural ingredients  i add it to my coffee in the morning to make my poor man s cafe mocha  much better quality and taste than powedered packages,1,0
3215,love it  i put it in protein shakes and even made hot chocolate with it   this product is 13 73 at vitacost   just saying  cheaper elsewhere,1,0
3212,i used to feed my shelly pro plan s chicken and rice formula  however  purina changed it by making  a shredded blend which consists of regular nuggets with shredded  beige pieces   shelly does not like the new blend and i had a hard time getting her to eat it   consequently  i tried to find another pro plan product that would be more appetizing for her   i tried the all life stages small bites lamb and rice product and shelly finds it much more palatable   for one thing  all the nuggets are same size and they are solid unlike the shredded formula where the nuggets are mixed with beige  rubbery pieces   i m not kidding  the beige pieces look like rubber and when i tried to pull one apart  it was like pulling rubber   no wonder shelly doesn t like it  i don t blame her   shelly also likes the  all life stages  smaller nuggets although being an australian shepherd  she can easily chew bigger nuggets i buy purina s pro plan because they state it is made in america   i read the label on the package and it does indicate that the product is manufactured in st  louis  mo   i do not want any dog food that is made in foreign countries  especially china   i heard that purina is now making some of their products in china so i will call purina  the parent company is nestle  inc   to be sure that this particular product is  in fact  made in the usa   in these times  you can t be too careful   if it is not made here  i will write an addendum to my review shelly really likes this product and it seems easier on her stomach   if you choose to purchase it  just be careful to incorporate some of your pet s regular brand with this new formula until your pet s digestive track can get used to the change in diet  i did that with shelly s food and it worked out well i like the texture and look of this product but more important  shelly likes it   i also like the fact that it is nutritious for all life stages in a dog s life   shelly and i are recommending purina s pro plan all life stages small bites dry dog food without reservation finally  if anyone from purina is reading this review  get rid of the shredded blend or improve on its appearance and texture   those beige  rubbery pieces are awful and should be eliminated   yuck  dog gone good,1,0
3211,i bought it at my local grocery store as i was looking for a particular coconut water and i came across this as i know alkaline water is suppose to be better for you than just filtered water  so i picked it up and was scared to drink it because i was afraid it would have some sort of taste to it  i have drank water with charcoal before and so i thought it might taste like that but it is purely tasteless  it taste just like plain water  i haven t done much research yet on fulvic trace minerals so i can t speak too much on that and their website is launching in 42 days as i write this  i would drink it again and research the benefits  the color is off putting and it is very mental as to why people say it has a taste and they can t drank it or maybe i am just used to drinking alkaline  mineral enhanced water  i don t know  i ll buy it again too  there s really nothing wrong with this water,1,0
3210,these are good in a pinch  especially since they don t need milk  which i always seem to be out of  no little ones at home   although the other betty crocker mashed potatoes that do require milk has a better texture and fluff up better  with these you just need to watch the amount of water  or they ll end up too thin  they have a slight butter taste without that fake butter taste  serve them up plain  with butter  with gravy  or any other way now  i m off to order more    not bad    very convenient ,1,0
3209,i acquired the taste of this licorice the first time i tried it  i say acquired because at first i didn t like it  but a chunk of it got jammed in a molar and was for a while irretrievable  by the end of that struggle  i actually liked it  i liked it enough to buy this pack of six tubs it s an awful lot  so i offered to share it with a few friends  hoping they would like it but warning them they might not  i told them i liked it  and i proved it by popping one into my mouth my friends hated it  but as a joke  they pretended to like it whenever i offered it to someone else  we would all have a good laugh as the curiosity on their faces fade into confusion  then disgust  most people spat it out and asked me   and you actually like that stuff  the people who refused to play along with the joke made it even funnier  i always warned people that the taste was very different and they might not like it  when else someone chimed in and said they didn t like it  that just intrigued people more so to sum up my experience  given the amount of licorice  this item is fairly priced  given to friends  the reactions are priceless  candy and a show,1,0
3208,i really like these kind bars  they re tasty  they re light  and they re good for you the bars i m reviewing are pomegranate  blueberry  and pistachio  they really don t taste like any of those  they taste like an almond bar with various bits of indistinguishable fruit bits  here are the ingredients  with the titled ingredients in all caps  almonds  blueberry pieces  blueberry  apple  and plum puree   raw sugar  glycerol  citrus fiber  cashews  honey  raisins  glucose  pomegranate  crisp rice  chicory fiber  pistachios  soy lecithin  natural flavors  the ingredients are always listed in descending order of how much is included  and kind pulled a fast one by calling their  blueberry pieces  a separate ingredient  since it s really just apple puree  by my math guesstimate  there is less than 5  of pomegranate  blueberry  and pistachio in the whole bar basically  this tasted like an almond bar  my advice is to read the ingredients  and expect it to taste like what s in the ingredients  and not go by what the title is on these bars they re also really gooey  these are probably the stickiest bars i ve ever had  i never pick them up with my hands  but i eat them out of the plastic also  i ve ordered about ten of these boxes off of amazon  and one box was rock hard  not this one  but another kind  so if your box is hard as a rock  then just order another one  and odds are it will be okay pros  good for you lots of natural ingredients one bar is a good snack  not too sweet  not too small  just right cons  the ingredients on the title of the bar misrepresent the actual ingredients very gooey and sticky  you won t be able to touch them with your hands from my experience  10  of the boxes have bars that are hard as rocks good for you  tasty  but gooey,1,0
3207,up to the arrival of our third cat  i had always been sold on wellness brand products  they were pricey  sure  but i got the guarantee of human grade meats and careful production that tends to be sloppily handled by lower end brands and producers  however  it soon became clear that  between the dog s food and my cats   we were rapidly reaching an untenable position in terms of financing the food bill  i needed to find something a bit more cost effective  and solid gold was the answer i had seen the packaging in stores before  and it was always a  maybe next time  afterthought as i hauled another big bag of food to the register  the somewhat gaudy purple packaging  for some reason they have a picture of indigo moon  had always turned me away in favor of the more muted tones of several other companies  but  no longer having those options available  i finally gave the brand serious consideration  the ingredient list is pretty good  primarily chicken meal  lamb  and barley  i ll hardly say this is ideal  barley is believed to possibly be an allergen  dry foods  carbohydrate levels are almost as a rule too high for our specialized carnivore friends  and there is a small faction of people who believe meat meals to be of inferior quality  but at the same time  it stacked up pretty well pound to pound with my old foods  and with a similar ingredient list  it was also notably cheaper  however  i bought it  and my cats were immediately made fans  my male cat is much pickier than his female companion  but he was more than happy to chow down   i was going to leave the review as stated  but i have found out something that may be troubling to fellow pet owners  solid gold apparently lets its production be handled by diamond  which  as i m sure you know  has had multiple screw ups over the years  including the salmonella outbreak in their taste of the wild dog foods  i m letting my review stand as is as i haven t had any problems healthwise with either myself or my pets  but if you are a person who boycotts food produced by diamond  then you may want to look elsewhere  when money perks back up  i might do so  great choice,1,0
3206,these bowls are the dimensions stated  but not what may seem  small    that said  good quality   wet food sticks  so need to clean frequently   we use these actually for our cats  it slows them down  but also tends to make a mess with scraps outside the bowl   better than vomit  though  larger size than you might think,1,0
3214,i enjoy coffee and drink 2 4 cups of the stuff a day  im not a cafe snob so im not going to pretend i know a lot about the cafe subject  i bought a melitta coffee maker a rebadged hamilton beach  and i figured hey why not try melitta coffee  i m use to buying the spanish coffee  bustello and pilon   they both are cuban espresso blend  that stuff is fine however it is slightly bitter  this blanc et noir with light and dark blends is wonderful  there is almost no bitter taste in it all  the one thing with the melitta coffee some of the  character  of the coffee seems to be subdued  maybe a little to much  robbing the blend of much character or boldness  seems like in a effort to make a smooth non bitter coffee some of the characteristics of the coffee was subdued in the process  this isnt to say it has no flavor or character in it  it does  and i can detect the two different levels of the blends  i still enjoy the blend however i dont know where to purchase this locally  i live in a major city so im sure some store must carry it  the price of a individual bag itself isnt bad  a bag of gevalia here retails for  9  10  the melitta is about  7 8 online  however once you factor in the shipping everything equals out  as it stands im not sure if willing to spend twice the amount of what i usually spend on a bag of coffee  maybe as a occasional treat i may order it  melitta blanc et noir   it s good,1,0
3205, paradise tropical tea  is a brand name  not a description of the tea itself   china black  as per description  is the tea type itself  this tea is a good strong black tea that makes an excellent iced tea   i have tried the  tropical  and it is ok if one likes flavored drinks   i prefer the basic  i have been using this tea for several years and would be very disappointed if i had to make a change in brands   i used to buy it by the case at my local coffee shop  but their distributor quit handling it   so now i am here at amazon   my recipe for  espresso  tea is as follows  2 pouches of tea in the carafe of a coffee maker and put in 4 cups of water per bag in the reservoir and hit start   let stand 5 minutes then remove pouches   then i put the tea in the fridge   to serve  i mix a ratio of tea to water according to my currant needs and taste  a couple of shots of tea to a glass of water  paradise tropical tea,1,0

3236,wow  just saw this item  what a rip off   i just bought the box of 80 pouches at costco for 9 99   seems this is not a great deal   unless of course you are held hostage and can not get out to shop  bad deal for the       ,1,0

3254,i use one packet per jar to make yogurt almost daily  i m not happy that they raised the price on me  but otherwise the product appears to work as advertised  it has a bit of a funny taste  but i suspect that is the strong bacterial content  use regularly,1,0
3253,okay  i had to speak up  hello  common sense and directions on toys  one  choose a toy that is large enough to encourage dogs to chew using their side back teeth  you do not want a toy that is small enough for dogs to use their front teeth or likely they will crack their front teeth  ect  so even if the toy says is is meant for large dogs  pay attention to how your dog chews on it  if they re chewing with their front teeth  take it away and try the next size up  two  yes  toys sometimes do say for powerful chewers  if your dog is tearing off large chunks of the toy  take it away  do not let your dog keep it then act surprised that your dog is having digestion problems  nylabone toys are meant for dogs to take off tiny slivers at a time  no bigger than a grain of rice  i don t care what  strength the chew toy is   if it s not strong enough for you dog  take it away and try a larger tougher toy all of this is common sense  but in case that escaped you  it s also on the directions  common sense,1,0

3247,i rescued 2 cats   both of them have been sick from the time we got them which has been 4 years   i took them to the vet several times  but it was always a temporary relief   along with some other natural remedies i found from generous people who shared what worked for them on a website  one cat is cured from throwing up every time she ate to not at all   the other one had several bouts of uri   when i switched from science diet to this food  it made a huge difference   i tried other natural remedies adding organic apple cider to their water   rubbing a 50 50 vinegar water solution on the nape of their neck that were suggested  but i credit their healthy state mostly to switching to wellness core  because i don t give them anymore vinegar   it was a 2 month dedicated struggle  great catfood,1,0
3233,i recently purchased this at a big box store  i don t usually drink instant coffee   normally i do the melitta ready set joe single cup coffee brewer single cup brew method if your goal is to have a good cup of coffee without the waste an auto drip entails then i highly recommend the melitta  as long as you keep the filter cone clean  which is easy  and you measure your ingredients  bad coffee will be a thing of the past  it won t make awful tasting coffee magically taste good but it will make passable coffee taste better cup for cup actually  that is why i switched to brewing with a pour over cone filter  with auto drips bad coffee is a frequent experience  for me no matter who brewed it  anyway  back to the instant stuff it s instant  i ve never had a cup of instant that didn t have an aftertaste and this product is no different  however  how bad the aftertaste is greatly distinguishes one brand from another more so  i think  that the actual coffee taste buendia s flavor is good  it has a solid coffee taste to it  the aftertaste is there but not obnoxious unless you brew it really strong  the directions call for 1tsp for 8 oz of water but i use 2tsp for about 10oz of water because i like a stronger cup of coffee  i noticed that when i brewed it per the directions the aftertaste was substantially milder it doesn t dissolve immediately either  even with boiling water  that could be a real problem and if you ve ever gotten a sip with an undissolved crystal you know what i mean  it does dissolve eventually  the odd thing is i ve sipped these partially dissolved crystals without experiencing that terrible intense flavor big box stores are probably substantially less expensive than an on line purchase  shop around  smooth with a better than average taste,1,0
3246,i like the small size cans which are hard to find in the super markets  but  i will probably not order again   the ginger ale has a nice tangy  gingery flavor  but is way too sweet for my taste   i was raised in detroit and recall the real vernors ginger ale made with sugar  not fructose  and not overly sweet   wish someone would make it again  sweet drink,1,0

3242,i received a tabasco caddy of six flavors and this was one of them  its flavor is not that memorable against the typical asian chili sauce market  there are a lot of sauces out there with the same look  consistency and flavor  this has a spicier kick as the name implies which is good but for its size i go through it way too quickly for the price shipping  tabasco red has a specific flavor and its size compliments the price and portion you use  this flavor can be found elsewhere  in greater sizes  for the same price if not less  besides that  it s good and i like it  i burn through this stuff way too quickly ,1,0
3241,this is more of a  heads up  than a review at this time   i ordered these the other day  free shipping   yea    received the e mail that item has been shipped  with a delivery date in about a month   what the heck   a little research shows me that these little thai peppers have actually been shipped    from thailand   now  i m not complaining   i m in no particular hurry to receive them  although sooner would have been better  but not a problem   i re read the description again  and it gives no indication of the long wait for delivery i look forward to getting these  as i can t find them around here   i ll be sure to come back and update the rating for the actual item after i receive them   maybe this situation is a one off  i don t know   just be warned that it may take a while for this item to hit your doorstep mailbox additional info ordered 08 18 2012shipped 08 20 2012 via thailandpost  pretty decent turn around considering i ordered late at night  and then there is that time difference   they show the 20th  my e mail shows the 19th delivery scheduled for 09 13 2012   09 27 2012will post when item is received   who knows  it may not take so long  just have little to no experience with items actually being sent from overseas   heck  it may show up tomorrow for all i know as of 9 9 2012   no item   e mailed seller even though i am still out of the  scheduled delivery    the middle of the weekend   here and in thailand   and had a response within two hours  impressive    no update on tracking  not sure they can really even offer that   but response was quick and courteous   and they made me want these chiles even more   shame on them   when  and i do hope this comes to pass  i order from them again  i will order more than one package   i m afraid of running out of these tasty little peppers   will have to research on growing from seed   as of 9 15 2012   these little beauties arrived either 9 12 or 9 13  not sure as i don t check my mail everyday   well within the delivery window they stated   while i have not cooked with them yet they appear to be excellent   they look to have been nicely dried and smell awesome   3 5 ounces should last me a while as it was more than i expected volume wise   they were indeed sent from thailand  package was complete with  customs declaration  i would highly recommend this seller and this product  with the caveat that it will take time for you to receive them   if that is not an issue  do it   thai peppers shipped from thailand ,1,0
3240,i m a hot sauce fanatic and tabasco  red  is what cuts it for me at the dinner table  forget that lame frank s stuff  i received an awesome caddy of six flavors from tabasco and this was one of them  habanero is one of the hottest peppers  naturally grown  on earth  that said  tabasco managed to bottle it in its entirety  i can dump the red sauce on food and it s all okay until i finish and my mouth burns for a few manageable minutes  this sauce i put a few drops on something and that s it  it is hot  hot  hot  if you put too much on something you can literally feel your stomach burning  it has a true habanero flavor and thicker consistency than the thin  uniformity of the traditional red  for hot sauce gurus like me i suggest you try this  for wimps and amateurs  steer clear    it will bring a tear to your eye  liquid fire for those who like it hot ,1,0

3201,i ve been using barley and wheat grass juice for about 20 years  i use to grow a lot of it myself  juice it  and drink it  in recent years i have travelled extensively and don t have the circumstances for growing and juicing barley wheat grass   from this point on i ll simply refer to barley grass  although all statements also apply to wheat grass  in recent years i have watched a multitude of cheap barley wheat grass powders make their way onto the market  please note that most of these products are  in my opinion  next to useless  they are made from whole dried barley wheat grass  cellulose and all  the primary concept of having barley wheat grass is to have the juice  free of the almost indigestible cellulose fibre of the leaf  all the early research on the many benefits of barley grass was from ingesting the pure  fresh juice  then a process was developed  in japan  as far as i am aware  to spray dry the juice whilst keeping most of the enzymes and nutrients intact  that processed involved using using simple sugars as a medium to help the juice turn to powder  the result is a high quality product  but one that is not pure juice powder fast forward many years  and i come across the grass juice products from pure planet  as you will see from my review on just barley   organic barley juice   80 gram   powder i give it five stars having used 5 or so jars of this product from now foods i have to say the product seems identical enough that i can t tell the difference  however  now foods gives you 118 grams for  currently  around  20 on amazon  the pure planet product on amazon is  currently  around  14 to  15  when you do the math  the now foods product is almost half the price obviously the many barley grass powders  not juice powder  as going to be a lot cheaper  but i really don t think it s worth it  much of the nutrients in those powders are still going to be bound up in hard to digest cellulose  and they are far less concentrated  i ve tried a few and they taste pretty poor and don t give me the lift i get from juice powder  an excellent and true barley grass juice powder,1,0
3173,i first bought a simular item from the store and my little toy poodle trustie loved it   so when i saw this offered in a much larger amount and for the price i had to give it a try   well i am glad i did and trustie is even more so   when i gave him his first one i found out they are a slight larger than the ones i had bought before   the thing is after i gave it i was shocked by his excitement because he started chewing and didn t stop but only to go for water and then when it was almost gone   he then finished it the next night in front of me while i watched tv he chewed   so all in all i would give these an a  and i am sure trustie would agree  none stop chewing,1,0

3170,my picky italian greyhound goes crazy for these   definitely his favorite snack of many   there are four distinct flavors and the dog even gets more excited for some over others   firm dense but not rock hard   enough to give a decent teeth cleaning but little dogs can still break them apart   they crumble when chewed but not particularly messy like some dry snacks   i was really disappointed to not find them locally anymore but at least we can get them online  my dog s preferred snack ,1,0

3168,another minnesotan who frequently could not enjoy his backyard and deck due to swarms of the minnesota state bird   our mosquitos have been known to carry off small children   this product won t prevent all the mosquitos   but it sure knocks them down for a few weeks does anybody else think it is odd that the price for just the product alone is more than the price for the product in the bottle with the built in sprayer   i don t think their sprayer is very good  so i buy the cheapest i can get and dump it into my ortho hose end sprayer   now    why can t we buy this stuff in gallon or 5 gallon jugs  not perfect   but what an improvement ,1,0
3166,this honey is addictive  i was reminded of caramel when i first tried it    it was enticingly sweet and ended in a licorice flavor  which i wasn t too fond of  because i hate licorice  until i continued to use it in my tea as it turns out  it is addictive and i prefer it over my other raw organic honeys  it has to be that caramel note  this honey is decadent and definitely gourmet    if you want something natural that tastes like a dessert  then this is it the only downside is the lid to the glass jar  there is a  food liner  underneath the lid  if you re familiar with ball jars  they have a plastic layer on the underside of the aluminum lid that contains bpa  it s the same with this lid i emailed heavenly organics and asked them if it contains bpa  they have not replied and it s been about a week i planned to buy from their website because i ll save nearly fifty dollars by buying a case directly from their website  however  if they don t reply i ll just be spending my money on something else also  if you re easily offended by little specks of  whatever  in raw honey  you might not want to order this  there s lots of debris in the jar that made me think the bees were harmed in the process of harvesting  i checked the website and they have a video that shows how the honey is harvested and i think they re trying their best not to harm the bees  this is obviously unfiltered but i have absolutely no problem with it i think it is a big deal to buy from companies that treat the bees with respect and avoid the ones who are careless and harm the bees  i m not 100  sure about this one  since the video is showing how most honey in india is harvested and isn t showing a video of this one particular company s methods  but their website suggests that they are very careful and pride themselves on how they treat animals with care and respect  i trust them enough they have two other types of honey for sell on their website that i really want to try  but first i need to know about those lids   update 20 08 12they replied to my email and confirmed that the lids do contain bpa  i apologize for the delay in response the closures from techno cap have bpa in the plastisol liner  the information i haveis that the bpa is an under coating in the plastisol liner and doesn t come in direct contactwith the packaged product  they also point out that the process to manufacture the closures andthe process to manufacture polycarbonate bottles are completely different  apparently they havetested these liners in europe where the standards are very stringent  they have ruled them safeas regards to bpa  plastisol contains  pvc   pvc is worse for your health than bpa  it is in no way healthier than bpa  i asked another company recently what their food liner consists of and i got the same answer  the coat that comes into contact with your food is plastisol  and beneath the plastisol is the layer that contains bpa  i m going to avoid these types of lids from now on since they all seem to be lined in plastisol i would pay more for this product if they would use a safer lid  it s about fifty three bucks including shipping for a case of honey from their website and i would throw twenty more dollars at them if they d use safer lids  bpa and pvc in lids makes it hard for an organic buyer to find a product that is truly organic organic honey with bpa and pvc free packaging certified organic manukareally raw honey  1 x 16 ozwee bee naturally raw honey    1 lb eachhnz organic clover honey  1 1poundsjarhimalaya herbal healthcare   soliga forest organic honey  8 8 oz gelwholesome sweeteners organic raw honey  16oz love it,1,0

3160,i have family in finland and go there every few years to visit   i always bring back candy  including this licorice  i was just eating some that i brought back and decided to see if they sell it on amazon and was surprised to find it   this licorice is very good and i don t really classify it as a licorice because i don t like licorice but like this stuff  finnish licorice is different  in finland  this type of licorice is very popular   in the usa  licorice is not that popular at all  which i think is because it is so different and not that good   if our licorice was like finnish licorice  licorice would be much more popular in this country   it is definitely worth a try  good stuff,1,0
3158,i have an american bully and he chews through everything pretty quickly  for example he can chew up a 12in bully stick in 2 to 4 hours  initially  he liked the chew but after the novelty wore off  he stopped chewing it  i gave 4 stars because it does last pretty long  but lost a star because he stopped chewing it and it kind of leaves a mess from the bits that break off   and it smells like new shoe rubber  which i guess is better than scent less bully tricks  not as great as expected,1,0
3157,this is the very best balsamic vinegar ever       as other reviewer stated it is a bit sweet but it is not the dominant flavor  this is not a watery vinegar    rather it is thick so i don t even use oil for dressings  great price  too  cook of the house,1,0
3156,okay   i was told by amazon that my review was way too short and i only needed to post a review of the actual product itself   i made a comment about the shipping charges being way too expensive but   whatever  it needs to be said anyway  about the chorizo itself   it is as a chorizo should be   i was looking for the small links that i grew up with that we used so much in our dishes   there are so many products out there that you can buy that don t even come close to what the real thing should be   and this is the real thing   alot of paprika   i still have 2 links left that i am saving for a rainy day   and despite the shipping charges  i would buy these again  delicioso ,1,0
3155,the russians say  no  not by itself but vinegar  acetic acid  increases the deadliness of any cancer causing nitrosamines in your diet   salt and sea salt always contain nitrosamines   beef  pork  and poultry always develop nitrosamines  and heterocyclic amines  when they are cooked in normal ways   processed meats contain nitrosamines even before they are cooked   the only way to avoid creating nitrosamines in bloody  raw meat is to boil it in water without adding any salt    please click  comment  below if you want to read what scientific studies from russia say about vinegar    balsamic vinegar is by far the most delicious of all vinegars but it contains a substantial amount of lead  which is toxic   the lead comes from the oak wood caskets in italy in which balsamic vinegar is manufactured   distilled white vinegar is made from corn and is very low in lead   french s yellow mustard  worcestershire sauce  heinz ketchup  and many other commonly consumed foods contain substantial amounts of distilled vinegar in their ingredients  does vinegar cause cancer ,1,0

3152,it has a nice strawberry flavor  but the frosting drizzle you see in the picture is not what you get on the actual bar   it is also too sticky   there is a fine line you can cross with these granola bars and when you cross it  it can become too much   the gooiness of the bar is a tad offputting at times   the bar literally sticks to the wrapper and comes apart merely trying to open the wrapper   that said  i really like the flavor   too often these rolled oat bars can taste bland despite any flavor profiles they claim to have   this actually backs up the flavor it claims to have on the box  and i appreciate that above all else   texture may be an issue  but taste is not  which is why this gets four stars from me   it is also healthier for you than other breakfast bars  and for those of us who like a low calorie snack that is filling  these are bars we can reach for  backs up the promise of strawberry tastiness   ,1,0
3162,i would recommend this to anyone who needs to eliminate sugar from their diet   it does not have that bitter taste as the powdered does  but it does leave that slight sweet taste on the tongue  but not bad   not as great tasting as regular sugar  but seems to be better for the health  much better than the powdered stevia,1,0

3177,at over  4 for a box of 35 packets  this is a pricey sweetener  organic or not  the quality is very good  there is no weird aftertaste and it has a pleasant taste  but i can t say it is so much superior to other sweeteners to justify the price  seems to be common with all stevia based products  if you can catch it on sale at your local supermarket  pick it up  but amazon isn t really offering any deal on the price here and there are less expensive alternatives at your local supermarket  high priced sweetener,1,0
3180,the first time i ate these noodles  i was quite disappointed   they tasted terrible  and i could not see how they amassed such great reviews   the second time i ate these noodles  i read the instructions on the package and realized i had made them wrong these were meant to be eaten like a pasta  not like a soup as i had incorrectly assumed   if you get these  don t make the same mistake i did in preparing them like a traditional ramen noodle bowl   drain the noodles from the water  toss them dry with the flavoring packets and some vegetables thrown in  and you ll be set for a delicious meal when made correctly  these noodles are awesome  read the instructions,1,0

3193,i have a mr coffee espresso machine so that pretty much tells you what level i am at when it comes to making espresso   my wife bought some cheap grind espresso from ikea and it was awful   decided that i should try some better stuff before giving up and selling my soul to starbucks   read all of the reviews and decided to buy this stuff   i could not be happier   the coffee has none of the bitterness that some other brands had that i tried   every sip brings back memories of trips to europe this is definitely my new coffee and will be sticking with it as long as i own an espresso maker  tastes good to me,1,0

3185,apparently  i am unhappy with the price jolt of this coffee  which i use daily  i am even more unhappy with the discontinuation of the coffee makers and the fact that the coffee pods can only be found on amazon or on the senseo website for this new higher price  however  i really believe that even though disappointed  we should not simply go and buy a keurig system  this heavy impractical and not tasting so well system that flooded the us market in the past 3 4 years should not benefit and celebrate the pushing away of its competitor  i kind of believe that the whole thing is a scheme done on purpose so that keurig can monopolize the market  and if everybody who is frustrated with not finding the senseo pods  jumps to keurig  that just fulfills their goal as a cheaper alternative  use the melitta pods  i just ordered them  have not tasted them  but the reviews said they are pretty similar  let us hope so  and let us hope that senseo will find a way to stay in the us market and even reclaim some of its lost presence  do not buy keurig  you are only helping them,1,0

3182,here my findings  it tastes very salty  so be careful how much you use  also be aware that it looks like sugar  so if you plan in not storing it in its original package  mark it carefully fun aside  kosher salt is dried sea salt  it can be a bit deceitful  if you have a recipe that calls for spoon measured salts  look up how much ounces fit on a spoon and weigh it  kosher salt comes in bigger crystals then normal salt  means bigger volume with less actual salt  so be sure you measure accordingly there is nothing else i can tell you    now  how does anyone write a reviewfor salt ,1,0

3337,the roses showed up quickly  so very little damage from lack of water sunlight but they showed up with several flowers smaller than indicated on the picture  considerably smaller after putting them in water and letting then breathe a little  they grew to slightly bigger sizes but never got to the size of the pic if you are within driving dance of a flower shop and your recipient is close  i would suggest going that route to much anonymity when you buy from this seller  so you have no idea what condition it is going to show up in however  with that said  and my recipient being 4 states away from me  it is a much better price option buying from this seller than a normal flower shop it as its pros and cons  but i will buy from them again  they were acceptable,1,0
3336,yes  i got my box for free  i probably wouldn t have bought it  there are too many cereals i like to bother with one i might or might not like  right my concerns were two fold  first  would they be sweet enough  i don t need sugar coated cereal  but i don t want to eat cardboard  either  and second  tight woven cereals like this tend to suck up all the milk  so they ll start off too dry  but end up too soggy  could this cereal overcome those concerns in a word  yes the flavor was sweet  with a hint of cinnamon  the squares started off crunchy  but not too rough  and they did not suck up the milk like a sponge  so they weren t too soggy at the end  either i still have other cereals that i like better  but i ll likely occasionally buy this one  too  quite good,1,0

3334,i received the gum today and like it better than i had expected to i only chew 1 piece at a time  the serving size on the box says  2 pieces  and many customers who have rated it under other listings on amazon have said they chew 2 pieces at once  but it is big enough for my purposes also  i chew it only for about 15 minutes and the flavor lasts with no problem at all i mainly wanted this specific gum because of the high percentage of xylitol it contains  because xylitol is good for the health of teeth  and because of its lack of other stuff  which is in almost all other types of gum  that i don t want like aspartame  nutrasweet   saccharin  sorbitol  mannitol  artificial flavors  artificial colors  etc    a few years ago i tried two brands of  natural  gum that didn t have any of those ingredients i m trying to avoid  but they were awful   fell apart in the mouth  tasted bad  contained sugar  etc so i grudgingly went back to chewing orbit with xylitol because my dentist told me to chew gum for the sake of my teeth  even though in all other ways i scrupulously avoid aspartame etc   i limited myself to one piece a day of orbit because i didn t really want to be ingesting the unwanted stuff therefore  i m really pleased to have found this gum this week   because it has the right blend of ingredients for me  even if the flavor had been nonexistent  i would have been happy with it  so i m extra pleased that there is a nice mint flavor and that it does last for at least 15 minutes  i only want to chew it for that length of time  so i didn t try it for longer     note that this gum is manufactured in finland and the xylitol is sourced from birch wood  also  it s non gmo  not genetically modified    which is not the case with some other up and coming brands of xylitol gum  which source their xylitol from china and or from corn    apparently if the mouth has 5 exposures to xylitol a day  its health improves greatly after only a few weeks  my main concern is to reinforce the enamel of my teeth as much as possible  because they have been sensitive for years and the sensitivity is getting worse with age  to that end  i m going to order a 16 ounce package of xylitol crystals powder soon  i found a cheaper offer on another site than i did here  and mix a little of the powder with water each day in a jar and swish the solution around my mouth a couple of times a day  so i can extend the lifespan of my stock of this expensive gum by chewing it just once or twice a day if you want to avoid xylitol from china and or from corn  also take care when purchasing the crystals powder in either 16 ounce packages or small single serving packages   i found very few brands that get their xylitol from birch  just what i was looking for,1,0
3333,i had the same experience as another reviewer  i love this dressing and my local supermarket stopped carrying the product so i was thrilled to find it on amazon  my shipment arrived poorly packaged  all the bottles were leaking and the seals had been broken  considering that the dressing needs to be refrigerated after being opened i did not want to eat it  i contacted amazon and they sent me a replacement order free of charge  the second shipment was no better and i had to discard all the bottles  i wonder if amazon is responsible for the poor packaging or if it is the vendor and whether or not it may be the heat during shipping that is causing all the seals to be broken update  the manufacturer company contacted me after this review and offered to send me a case of their dressing for my troubles  it arrived in a matter of days and all the bottles were undamaged  their customer service is impeccable  making sure to follow up with me after i had received the delivery to ensure all was ok  i loved this product before and love it even more now  wonderful experience  thank you  wafu  product arrived damaged twice  update   ,1,0

3339,i read alot about available canned marzano tomatoes  i watched a bunch of u tube videos that showed me what was inside a collection of brands  i ordered these strianse s after trying a few other  top line  dop san marzano tomatoes   these are the ones to get   these are bright and fresh looking out of the can   i simply pour the can in a bowl and crush them with my hands   nothing else really needed to do to prepare these tomatoes for use   other cans require trimming hard ends off of each tomatoes   add a little herbs  salt and pepper   everyone loves my pizza sauce  these are the marzano tomatoes you want,1,0
3331,it s cholula if you like cholula a lot then you will like half a gallon of cholula even more  i bought this for a bachelor friend s birthday about six months ago  he loved it  unfortunately the pump lid was cracked  this didn t affect the pump s working but was still bothersome  if you want to have half a gallon of cholula that you can pump into your food buy this  good stuff ,1,0

3328,kikkoman gluten free soy sauce has the best flavor  i have san j brand also but it is my back up  not my preferred soy sauce buying this item from this seller nets out to approx   10 per bottle with shipping  this is a serious gouge it is worth your while to call around and find it locally  initially i could not find it locally so i ordered it from amazon   however  several days after ordering it  i found a local store selling it for  3 39 per bottle  i ordered 8 bottles from the local store  also  it was late arriving  it was not a  3 pack  but 3 bottles packed in paper in a box  caution   over priced,1,0
3327,ok  so i m not the sharpest tool in the shed  i went to grab the bottle of blair s after death sauce  but picked up sudden death by mistake  i proceeded to spill about a full teaspoon worth onto my plate  then dipped some battered fish into it  i realized my error the moment i started to chew  instantly my mouth felt like it was bursting into flames while angry bees began stinging my tongue  sweat started running from my head like a faucet  holy cow  it is waaaay hotter than dave s temporary insanity    taste  it s ok but who buys hotsauce for taste   even milk didnt help  the good thing though is that it stops killing you in about 15 30 minutes    that is   until it exits the other end    a mouth full of angry bees ,1,0
3326,even for  medium  sized chews  our 2 rat terriers  8 lbs and 13 lbs  breezed through these   they hardly spent much time at all actually chewing them   i ordered another bag  this time trying the large ones  to see if they last a little longer  i got them hoping it would help improve their breath a little bit  there may be a small improvement  but it hasn t been that long so i m not sure if they re doing the trick or not  we ll see  on the small side,1,0
3325,i received one bottle of this water to review  it tastes just fine  not a lot of flavor from the added minerals in the bottle  this seems to be some preliminary attempt at the alkaline bottled water market  the label indicates  ph is 9 5      purified waters require calibrated ph meter for testing   which implies to me that they don t yet have a calibrated meter    anyhow  the health benefits  if any  of the water are hard to assess  most mineral waters have more flavor and are also going to be moderately alkaline  tastes fine  but what s the benefit of alkaline water again ,1,0
3324,so i had the chance to try this water out  and i have to admit it seems like if there was going to be a health benefit you would need to drink it often  i received one bottle and i had some of it  the water tastes like purified water  theres no weird chemical flavors  or plastic flavors  there is no odor and it tastes clean  it reminds me a lot of smart water i can t confirm if there are positive health impacts  i haven t had enough to show that i m sure  but i can confirm it tastes just like water and if you are looking for something with a ph level of 9 5 this appears to be it   is it a buy try or don t buy  i d say you can give it a try  it s water    yep    ,1,0
3323,i drink a lot of water  but i rarely purchase bottled water  we ve been using  the new wave enviro premium 10 stage water filter system for a year now   essentia 9 5 ph drinking water has no taste   is very good  taste wise essentia 9 5 ph compares to the water i get from my faucet using the new wave enviro filter  however  essentia is enhanced with pure minerals   promotes its 9 5 ph alkalinity i don t know if there have been any scientific studies on the benefits of drinking alkaline water   my internet search was inconclusive if you are looking for an alkaline bottled water with a ph of 9 5  essentia won t disappoint you  refreshing    tastes like water should,1,0
3330,its a switchblade spork what else needs to be said  no one in there right mind would mess with a person who whipped one of these out  switchblade spork enough said,1,0
3322,water with a ph of 9 5 is thought to help with many physical ailments  google it  as well as hydrate better  especially after strenuous activity  i ve never seen much of a difference using sports drinks vs cold water  but many people do  this drink would be a much cheaper alternative to those  1 and  2 sports drinks  it does have a different  texture  than regular water  perhaps because of the ph level there is no source specified  so i assume it s from tap water   the source does not really matter to me  many of the springs in this country are becoming contaminated  and those that draw water from  mountain streams    eeewww   animals and people use those as a bathroom  and things die and rot there   the bottom line is that all water get filtered thoroughly  no matter the source  and it all starts in the same place   that s personal preference  but i m not paying a premium for  spring  water that s going to be filtered anyway  hey  it s h20 with a twist,1,0
3340,i have a bullmastiff  rottweiler  and shih tzu who looooved these  not many come in the bag so if you have big dogs they might not be worth it to spend money on  but i broke these into quarters for my shih tzu  due to so many pet food and treat recalls over the last couple years i am wary about many things i feed my pets  these being made in the u s  made me more comfortable than some things made in china  i will stock these for my small dog but at the price they are now i won t buy them for my large dogs  my 3 dogs loved these,1,0
3342,it s not just a bunch of stems   there is a mixture of cuts  tops  tops w  stems and some smaller pieces i do advise pre soaking them before use texture and taste is decent considering they are dried   obviously not as nice as fresh shitake mushrooms  but a lot more affordable b c they don t go bad  pretty good,1,0
3366,the bottle i received was a 1 5 liter size   very large  i have a photo at the top    i usually get more manageable sizes to take with me when i walk jog   a size that fits in the cup holder of my stroller   anyway i thought i d give this a shot today since i was going for a longer jaunt  a 5 mile combined jog   walk with my stroller and perhaps i d want more than just one small water bottle the bottle size actually made it so i drank less because i had to store it in the bottom of the stroller and it wasn t readily available    so i only drank half of it and that was consumed at the end of my outing   but i sort of felt more energized after drinking it   and i was quite pooped after 5 miles of pushing the stroller   i don t know if that was psychological because i knew there were electrolytes in it or if there really was more of a boost i can t comment too much on if the ph is of any benefit or not  i understand you have to drink this for awhile before any benefit kicks in    however i did a quick search online to see if i could read anything from an independent source telling me why 9 5 ph or a higher ph in general is good for you and i couldn t find anything except websites that were trying to sell me their products   i couldn t find a website to tell me why this was good that wasn t trying to sell me anything and that had some credibility   so please keep that in mind   one of the websites that was trying to sell me their ph stuff sited some  japanese study  but gave no specifics    so i could not even look that study up to verify anything   so it sort of leaves me to believe the ph thing may be a fad   probably a harmless one though bottom line    water tasted good   i like the electrolyte thing   don t care much about the ph  think that may be silly  it tastes    like nothing   refreshing to drink after a 5 mile walk ,1,0
3362,ok i want to make sure to state i am new to all the uses of seaweed  i did read on a website it is recommended to use dried seaweed for a facial mask  together with aloe vera  i followed the directions and my face was red and irritated like never beforei just wanted to make sure that if you try to use this product for a facial mask  do your homework  i can not say if i just had a bad reaction or if you are supposed to use another form of seaweed this is why i gave it four stars  because i know people have lots of different uses for seaweed  and i felt giving it a lower rating would not be fair  as it might be of great use and qualityhope this was helpful to someone probably of good quality but do not use for facial mask,1,0

3352,i love sweet potatoes and it s hard to find sweet potato cake mix  so i was excited to make this  i grated half a raw sweet potato into the mix and let the batter sit a while as the box suggested  optional  before baking   the cake came out moist  dense  and full of sweet potato flavor    but way too sweet  even when on another try i added oat bran for a healthier version  sugar content isn t numerically higher than other cake mixes  22 grams per serving  but the taste is way sweeter   maybe that s not a bad thing if it satisfies your sweet tooth with just a small sliver at a time  moist  flavorful  but too sweet,1,0
3351,i am not quite sure why so many reviews say this product causes them to break out   it does the total opposite for me   i have been searching for years for a product that can take care of face and body breakouts and finally found this   it s not even advertised as an acne treatment  but it is the only thing that has ever worked  i have naturally oily skin  i suppose  so the drying effect described by many is beneficial for me  as it returns the skin to normal   it leaves your face feeling tight  but not dry i will definitely attest to the fact that this is a different product than the same label in the store   the review that mentioned this was much more watery and less scented hit the nail on the head   however  it still does the job  it s just curious that it s different i could by 3 smaller bottles at my local grocery store for close to  20 or get three huge ones here for 15 all in all  if you have oily skin all over  this works   if you don t  i figure it may dry it out    only product that has given me clear skin,1,0

3278,it s ok to drink the water in these del monte french style green beans cans because no salt has been added and lead has been banned from the canning process in the u s   in fact  according to the  nutrition facts and analysis  website  the fluid in the can contains at least 20  of the nutritional value  vitamins  minerals  and antioxidants  of the entire can of green beans   so drink the fluid inside the can as if it were a very healthy tea   all beans are moderately high in antioxidants  and calories    french style green beans are slightly above average among beans in antioxidants and substantially below average among beans in calories   among beans  only soybeans  which are high in calories  are healthier for us to eat than these low calorie green beans   eating 6 cans of green beans equals the same number of calories as eating 1 can of soybeans   like most modern varieties of green beans  there is no string in these french style green beans   when compared against libby s french style green beans  no salt added   del monte  this product  was just slightly firmer and just slightly better tasting inside the can   but libby s product is priced slightly lower than del monte s   according to whfoods com  green beans are moderately high in the carotenoids  beta carotene  lutein  zeaxanthin  violaxanthin  and neoxanthin and in the polyphenols bioflavonoids miquelianin  quercetin  kaempferol  catechins  epicatechins  and procyanidins and in the absorbable  bone friendly mineral  silicon  it s ok to drink the water in the can,1,0

3274,started drinking the domatcha organic variety around 2008  i thought the domatcha organic 2nd harvest variety would be bitter or inferior flat tasting since you get more for your money ounce for ounce   finally tried the 2nd harvest variety a few months ago and i cannot tell the difference  it is just as smooth and flavorful as the more expensive  ounce for ounce  regular domatcha organic matcha  2nd harvest organic variety   tastes just like the regular organic matcha,1,0
3273,i purchased natural balance duck and potato formula canned food  it is a great product with healthy ingredients but unfortunately my two great danes did not care for it  they get half a can along with their fromm dry dog food twice a day and they took much longer to eat than with other high quality canned foods  good product but my beasts are a bit too choosey  dogs did not care for it,1,0

3280,it is hard to get just one falvor of this product  i was very happy to order 48 pouches  however  when they arrived the out side of the box label was turkey in gravy but they contained mixed grill instead  i could not return but amazon gave me a total refund  if you are ordering this  wait about 10 days  after 9 1 12 so you don t receive mixed grill like i did  it was labeled wrong from the factory so it will take them a while to get new shippments  my cat s favorite flavor,1,0
3268,believe me when i say i hate sweeteners that taste like sweeteners no splendano sweet and lono equalughhhhi took my chances and bought this put it in my green tea and i kid you not when i say there is no after taste and if you have tried sweeteners you know exactly what im talking about  it almost tastes like sugar  nectresse wasn t the 1st sweetener to use monk fruit its called lo han  just the first to be widely sold but never the less great taste tastes like sugar   but not 1st out,1,0

3265,if you think about the diet consumed by most people through most of history  the food was probably  by our standards  very bland  there were no refrigerators and no fast food  and there wasn t much refined sugar around  so how did people eat this bland and sometimes even rotting food  they doused it in salt and seasonings  and once you start putting salt  like this seasoned salt  on your bland food  you get used to it  i ve found that during my diet  i can keep to my goals as long as i have some lowry s handy  for instance  tonight i had a dinner of peas  potatoes and a little cottage cheese  that doesn t sound very appetizing  but once it s covered in lowry s seasoned salt  it s actually palatable  of course  there are some who believe the best way to diet is to eat food with no seasonings and as little flavor as possible  or what is known as the low palatability diet  while there is some truth to that idea  and though i ve been successful at losing weight on that diet  i don t take the hard line position that no seasoning is permissible  in fact  i think a lot of seasoning on bland food is the way to go if you can t take an entirely bland diet  so  to wrap it all up  lowry s is a great way to make bland food taste ok  if that s what you want  great for bland food,1,0
3264,while i think that the wizard card that accompanies each chocolate frog is really interesting  i m not so impressed with the chocolate   it s plain chocolate  not extremely flavorful  with the crispy rice   i found that the chocolate was kind of thick and it felt like it left a greasy residue on the inside of my mouth   the shape of the frog is very fun and my kids loved them the wizard cards  however  are very interesting   they have images of the different wizards mentioned in the harry potter books   on the opposite side  they re printed with information that is in addition to what is mentioned in the series   they re very cute and worth collecting  great card  okay chocolate,1,0

3262,i checked my past orders of the stash brand earl grey double bergamot tea  it seems i order about once every 8 months  this is now my 3rd order but the first time i bought it in bulk like this  the savings were minimal but worth it  i made sure to count all the bags to ensure a complete order was received  it was i was surprised to find a video by someone who spoke of earl grey as a vile and disgusting tea  i love this tea  however  i have met people that i have offered a cup of this tea  and a few have mentioned it smelled like pepper to them  bergamot  the predominant spice in this tea  is a citrus not unlike an orange whose oils are extracted for this tea  when i smell the tea  i smell a sweet aroma  if  when you smell this tea  it smells like pepper to you  you might first give it at least one sip before dismissing it  i typically put cream   sugar in my this  stash brand tea my all time favorite,1,0
3261,every time i repot plants  or buy new ones  i get little gnat things flying all over  this product will get rid of them  there is not odor  and they are easy to use  you just put one in the dirt with provided stakes in each plant  when you no longer see gnats  you can just toss these in the garbage  make sure to have some on hand for when you need them again  they keep the gnats from spreading if you put them out right away  very reasonably priced   if you are unable to watch the gnats dying  and it makes you sad  do not look at the strips   i have given many of mine away  because as soon as someone asks me what it is  they want some  excellent product,1,0
3260,had no problems with the quality of the product itself  liked the fact it was packed in water with no salt added however  after paying for shipping and handling  it was no longer a bargain to purchase it from amazon and will just buy it locally from now on  good  but better value locally   ,1,0
3267,i received these plants only a few days after ordering  all of them were very healthy the seller went out of his way to ensure i received detailed care instruction for each of them  both in the packaging and online i was impressed  would definitely buy more plants from him in the future my only disappointment was that the venice fly trap didn t help catch the tiny fruit flies i was wanting to get rid of   they require a regular size fly to land on them as a fruit fly doesn t weight enough to trigger their closing behavior  great plants  great seller ,1,0
3281,purina beneful original dog food was a success with two of our dogs  but the third  who won t eat dry food wasn t interested  she also doesn t eat vegetables  the other two do   so she wasn t tempted at all i don t know what the health benefits of feeding whole grains to dogs are  since some experts are promoting grain free dog diets   but i base my opinion on the reaction of the dogs  they ate it  they didn t get sick  and they weren t hungry an hour later  if all three would have liked it  i would have given it five stars  most  of my  dogs love it ,1,0

3285,holy crap  i bought this as just an experiment to see if it even did anything  it tastes a little strange  like it was watered down  but about an 30 min to an hour after i was starting to feel the drowsiness and nearly fell asleep like 3 times  i didn t even drink the whole bottle  i m saving it for a little before bed xd seriously  this just works wow,1,0
3312,as far as i can tell  these dried shiitakes are just as good as other brands of dried shiitakes   this product includes whole shiitake mushrooms of all sizes from very tiny ones to medium sized ones to moderately large ones   i didn t see too many colossal sized shiitakes  the ones the japanese would call   donko   which are separated from the rest and sold at a higher price in japan   havista didn t explain what they mean by  3 5 cm  and how it differs from  3 4 cm   which is slightly more expensive than  3 5 cm    these dried shiitakes will fully occupy exactly 5 1 2 one gallon plastic jars   product of china caution   havista s dried shiitakes are extremely rich in vitamin d2   without even contacting havista  i can tell that these shiitakes received plenty of sunshine where they were farmed   i get hypercalciuria  calcium sand in my urine  after eating only two thirds of the dried shiitakes in a 1 gallon plastic jar   hypercalciuria is a symptom of hypervitaminosis d  vitamin d overdose   there s nothing seriously wrong with these dried shiitakes,1,0
3311,pros  good for desk countertop in kitchen window ceal etc  the pot is good looking for a modern home   cons  the plant is smaller than expected and the saga palm is actually a cycad sago palm which is extremely poisonous to animals  including humans  if ingested  also the pot does not have holes in the bottom so it is hard to water the plant without flooding it and having all the little rocks overflow out  also if it is not properly watered it will get a yellow tint on the leaves showing a sign of lack of nutrition  great palm but a few dislikes,1,0
3310,i ordered this because i wanted a variety of coffee   i was happy when it said absolutely no duplicates   i read the reviews about some duplicates  but it was always the same flavor in decaf and in regular   i was going through my box  which was packaged very nicely   and saw gloria jean s butter toffee coffee  which looked great to me   i opened the next box and saw gloria jean s butter toffee again   i went back to make sure and there they were  both regular versions of gloria jean s butter toffee   i went through the whole box to see if there were any other duplicates and found green mountain coffee dark magic twice   again  both regular   i feel cheated out of two different coffees and think this should not read  no duplicates  because i clearly got two also  20  of my box was decaf  14 cups   which is not horrible  but just to let everyone reading know  i got duplicates ,1,0
3309,after reading these mixed reviews  i didn t know what to expect from these  well  i finally had to put the bag down to write this review  the first one out of the bag wasn t particularly crispy  but that was fine  it still had a very strong apple taste  i don t see how anyone can compare these to cardboard unless their tastebuds are compromised somehow   the next dozen pieces were very crispy  and i find the taste to be very flavorful  with 61 year old tastebuds      so count this review as a definite yes  and now i would like to go back to my snacking  can t eat just one    ,1,0
3308,i like the flavor of this coffee so much that i can drink the coffee black if no milk or creame is available   the only reason why i do not give it 5 stars is that keurig is not completely bpa free  love the flavor,1,0
3307,i ve always wondered why somebody wouldn t do exactly what these guys did  at first glance  1  cup seems pricey but  when i consider that sampling will spare me the expense of buying an entire  10 box of a single coffee that i deem undrinkable  the bottom line savings is immeasurable   lets face it  coffee roasts are not one size fits all  with varying degrees of boldness and flavor  i recommend ordering at least two of any given coffee so that you can experiment with brew sizes   coffeemix shipped my order quickly and it arrived just as ordered with a personal note of  thanks   genius ,1,0
3305,i like to snack on these at the office  i thought they had too much salt  so i rolled them around in a large colander to shake some salt off     it worked  i understand the egyptians grew almonds inside of wooden caskets  snacks for the office,1,0
3304,i know this is grody  but i had to show proof see images  that these really work  it did take a few weeks to really see a difference  but i went from spending an hour a night wacking and vacuuming moths off the ceiling and curtains to now  literally right now  i have 1 moth to kill  this is only 2 of the traps i put up  there is a 3rd  and i am going to stick up fresh ones just to be sure they are out of here   but yeah  these things are amazing  also  when we first opened the pheromones  there were male moths everywhere and at first i was upset because none of them went into the trap  but as you can see  they eventually do    they work      ,1,0

3301,this broth is tasty and works well with so many dishes   however  since my family was used to swanson  we found recipes that we were used to tasted different   although my taste buds are not smart enough to know what the difference was  i assume this comes from the combination of ingredients used to make this broth   the ingredients are listed here ingredients organic chicken broth  filtered water  organic chicken   organic chicken flavor  natural chicken flavor  chicken broth  salt   organic evaporated cane juice  autolyzed yeast extract  organic onion powder  turmeric  organic flavor going organic i have had to make many adjustments and this is just another one but totally worth it   in the long run going organic is the best thing for our family and despite tasting different this broth is still delicious   enjoy also  for those interested  from what i have read  autolyzed yeast extract  is a type of msg  the amino acids contained in the yeast extracts result exclusively from the proteins present in food grade yeasts  baker s or brewer s or lactic  which are used to manufacture the extracts  those amino acids contain a large proportion of essential amino acids  particularly lysine  together with glutamic acid  the yeast extracts contain a maximum of 18   glutamic acid on the basis of the total protein content  total glutamic acid refers to both free glutamic acid and glutamic acid in small peptides   the free glutamic acid content is between 6   and 13   of the total protein content  this free glutamic acid  which is a natural component of yeast extract  plays a major role in its aromatic power  glutamic acid  also referred to as monosodium glutamate  msg  has flavor enhancing capabilities and is associated with umami  the fifth taste sensation   www yeastextract info not your average broth   ,1,0
3299,these are not bad as far as flavored peanuts go  you can taste the cheese and garlic  tomato was so so  i was hoping for a more marinara sauce type of taste  the attempt may not have been for the broader italian taste that we equate to spaghetti sauce or pizza sauce  i wish the flavor had been bolder  my favorite is still the el cheddarales  good  but not italian,1,0
3296,let me start out by answering the question  is this the best coffee  no  nespresso still tates better  they after all are  created the system  have the research  and know what makes the ideal capsule will you notice a difference with a shot of pure espresso  yes  but will you notice a difference in your cappuccino  latte  or other coffee drink  no will you feel better about supporting a company with far better business practices than nestle  a company with nontoxic  biodegradable compost able capsules  nespresso capsules may be aluminum and recyclable but there are still plastics and glues that are not eco friendly in those capsules   and yet are still less expensive by far  of course  what do you think if you re worried that the capsule ruin your machine  absolutely not  they give this guarantee on their website  our experience has shown us that the nespresso club  may try to make you believe that our capsules damage your machine this is simply untrue  our capsules are slightly more resistant    this has no effect on your machine as proof  we promise to replace your machine should any problem be caused by one of our capsules as part of the machine s routine use  after doing research i also discovered that the former ceo of nespresso runs this company  so they clearly know their competition bottom line  i will keep ordering these capsules for quick shots  and morning cappucinos and coffee drinks  but i am still searching for something as good as the original nespresso branded ristretto and espresso capsules  as a frame of reference   my two favorites would be the purple capsule aka the arpeggio and burgundy capsule aka the decaffeinato intenso  hopefully the other flavors of this brand will make the cut because i love what they do  good coffee but even better company,1,0
3292,i sent these as a gift  they forgot to send my gift card  so the person didn t know who they were from  even though i paid whatever the price was at the time  expensive   the person receiving my gift thought they were a promotion  gift   they forgot to send my gift card,1,0
3291,i thought all of the flavors were really good   as a weight watcher most of them were only 2 points for 1 4 of a cup   it doesn t seem like a lot  but they were very filling and it was something different to have as a snack  chick pz,1,0
3290,good mint scent but lacks the nice strong mint taste not a harsh bite  provides a nice drink good caffeine kick makes a much better  sun tea  i can get two 12 oz cups from one bag  not bad   ,1,0
3289,i gave this product 4 stars because the taste and price are right   if the effects were as noticeable as they are for 5 hour energy  i d easily give it 5 stars   unfortunately i didn t get what i thought i would out of this product   then again  i m not as sensitive as a lot of people are about the effects of energy shots  tastes ok but i m not sure if it s as good as 5 hour,1,0
3286,ok  to be fair  i bought this at the store  but i suppose that doesn t matter in the long run  see  i ran out of the water enhancer that i normally use and happened to see this close by  it was cheaper than the generic mio i was going to buy  so i figured what the hey and bought it instead of mixing a packet in a 16 9 oz bottle  i mix it in a 1 ltr bottle  two in my bottle made it almost taste like peach mango juice  i find 1 per 1 ltr bottle works well enough to cover the  flavor  of the water  i also happen to like that it s fortified with vitamins and caffeine  not bad ,1,0
3151,there has been a lot of controversy in the news lately regarding olive oil and extra virgin most specifically  there are claims that most of what is labeled as  extra virgin  is either nothing of the sort or mixed with far inferior oils  most likely not even from olives  if you are a film lover you will find it ironic that organized crime has been blamed for this olive oil scam considering vito corleone s genco olive oil company from the godfather movies  to be honest  i only purchased this as a collectible because i collect items that are  or look like movie props and this is as close you re going to get to that unless paramount releases a godfather licensed genco olive oil  which isn t likely  the oil is ok but great as a godfather movie collectible ,1,0
4201,he started chowing down on this as soon as i opened it   fair warning  though   he spits out the plastic  he doesn t swallow it   those little chewed plastic pieces hurt like heck when you step on them with bare feet i d definitely buy this again  i just need to make sure i buy the larger one  my german shepherd loves this even though i bought the small one by mistake,1,0
3149,i ve tried deer antlers   some were great  others splintered into sharp shards that scared me   i tried a whole elk antler   30    it was durable  all right  because after my dogs figured out they couldn t get to much of the marrow  they lost interest   but all of them love this antler   they can grab onto it easily and scrape at the marrow   they all love it so much i have to be careful that they don t fight over it   however  one of them has managed to wear away the outer shell   she is a pit bull  but she s not an unusually powerful chewer   still  i would recommend this antler   the pieces they wear off are small  not sharp shards like the deer antlers  and it keeps them busy for a while and seems to satisfy their chewing needs better than artificial chew toys  best antler product i ve found  but not quite as durable as i expected,1,0
3147,the real thing   a little pricey  but once in a blue moon it is worth it   only problem was  i was finished eating all of them in no time   i better stick with the cheaper ones that don t taste as swell so they will last in the cookie jar  cookies,1,0

3021,this isn t too bad  though it is very green  so if the color of your smoothie is an issue for you  this may not be the best choice   i found there to be a gritty consistency    there may be seeds of some sort in this   i was also a little disappointed in the protein count   i ve got the plantfusion brand in chocolate and i think i prefer it for consistency and protein   all in all  this is a good product that makes a tasty smoothie  though  not too bad   ,1,0
3020,this product contains only beans   i like the mild cereal bean flavor  which does not overpower other ingredients i may add  such as yogurt and a packaged indian eggplant  tomato  and onion dish   the product doesn t contain added salt  and i don t miss it the product rehydrates rapidly in a microwave oven  i heat to only a bit higher than body temperature the bag looks like a sturdy coffee bag   the bag has a double ridge zipper seal   if i start sealing from side of the bag  the zipper works fine   if i start sealing from the middle of the bag  the ridges can get  cross threaded  the bag is completely sealed until i cut the top off with scissors   however  the ends of the zipper seals are not quite long enough to be fused into both sides of the bag  so i think that an extremely small and energetic insect could get inside   i keep opened bags in my refrigerator  if not  i would keep them in large zipper lock bags   again  this issue does not arise until the seal at the top of the bag is cut open i had been using the santa fe bean company instant fat free vegetarian refried beans  which i reviewed   but i prefer the lack of salt and the price of these culinary refried beans  santa fe bean company culinary refried beans    a good find,1,0
3027, natural  no weird ingredients or pesticides crunchy and sweet with a hint of cinnamon  if you like the taste of apples  you ll like these  healthy  i can inhale half a bag and not feel the urge to hibernate through the summer to burn off the calories  inconsistent hardness  some pieces are a bit on the softer side  more of a chewy crunchy rather than shatter your fillings crunchy  while others will make your ears ring from how crunchy they are  i personally don t have a problem with this  but some might  apple skin seems necessary  you mean i can pig out on these things and not hate myself  ,1,0

3015,it s funny because these treats look and smell just like old musty cardboard  but the dogs just adore them  they line right up for them and twice i ve had to reprimand them for stealing them right out of my hand when i was trying to give one to the dog next to them  they come in a sealed bag inside the outer paper back which can be re sealed for freshness  which didn t really matter much to me because these only lasted a week between my three greedy pups  cardboard yummies ,1,0
3014,nothing could take my thirst away  in the office i was drinking lots of water until realizing it was bottled and was low in  salts  but it meant low in sodium and low in many other minerals i was missing  i was drinking a lot of water and the trips to the restroom were also really frequent  so i started sprinkling some celtic sea salt on my glass and suddenly my thirst stopped and my restroom trips became less frequent  it s crazy how  they  are telling us to eat less sodium but it really means to eat less processed salt  do yourself a favor  get your unprocessed mineral sea salt and you ll feel the difference  salt is not creating hypertension  processed food  grains  breads and sugar is  get your fresh food and sprinkle good quality salt on it  finally got rid of my thirst,1,0
3013,was a little concerned since one review was not too encouraging   i have found it to be debris free  not overpowering smelling and tastes just as you would expect a sugar free chocolate to taste   so i will buy it again and it was a good price  good stuff ,1,0

3010,i have been hearing about konjac noodles for the past couple of years and finally got around to trying them  they are actually not too bad  if you are looking for a high fiber  low glycemic and zero calorie food  i ate mine with marinara sauce and although it wasn t great  it wasn t that bad either  i agree with other reviewers that it would be better in asian dishes  i might try this instead of rice noodles in pancit  an epic filipino dish  or maybe pad thai  i  have a really great recipe for a low fat seafood alfredo but i just don t think the texture of these noodles  even the ribbon fettuccine like cut of konjac shirataki noodles  would cut it for that dish to echo other reviewers  if you are sensitive to texture  you will probably have a hard time with konjac noodles  they can be rubbery  i think they are chewy and they remind me a little bit of calamari  i think konjac shirataki noodles are a great thing f you are on a restricted diet  or if texture is something you can get used to the smell when i opened the package was not exactly palatable  but i soaked them in cold water  and rinsed them in the colander  and the smell completely went away all in all  even though the texture wasn t so rad  the plus side  calorie free  carb free  and high fiber foodstuff to eat even if i ve hit my daily allotment for food  definitely outweighs  heh  no pun intended  the downsides  chewiness  no taste  of the konjac shirataki noodles  4 5 stars  finally tried them,1,0
3018,these antlers are expensive  but well worth the money   they last for weeks  and they are clean and odor free  i buy the split sliced ones because my dog lost interest in the whole one i bought for her   she couldn t get to the marrow  my dog loves them,1,0
3008,the seller was great  order came on time and we were happy with it   i would suggest putting a better description  i didn t realize they had a vanentine theme but it did work for what we are using them   had they been for something specific  i would not have been happy   candy was fine though  m m s purchase,1,0
3028,canned salmon is a very healthy food and an inexpensive way to get your omega 3s   wild salmon is way better than farm raised for your health   at the trident website  makers of rubinsteins red salmon  they claim there is no bisphenol a  bfa in the lining of their cans          it does contain the skin and bones of the salmon because the product is cooked and canned simultaneously   you can buy skinless and boneless canned salmon from trident under trader joe s house label or cosco s under the bear   wolf or kirkland labels  however the addition of bones adds natural calcium to the product   enjoy  very good quality,1,0
3030,i chose this dog food seeing grilled sirloin on the description i figured the dogs would like it alot well they sure did  they scarfed it down so fast it was as if we hadnt fed them in a week its very soft food and would be good for older dogs that have messed up teeth and cant chew very well the ingredients could be alot better the first ingredient is beef and thats good for them ingredients are listed with the main ingredient first just as all food products are the rest is a list of all kinds of stuff most likely not to good for them i see many people knocking it and thats fine i would bet they didnt throw it away though  ten bucks is a little pricey for 4 5 pounds of food i feel i guess im a cheepskate  i most likely would not buy it sorry purina  not as good as it could be  ,1,0

3047,i am poor but love earl grey tea and of all the types of earl grey this one is by far my favorite not only because of price but because of flavor i always end up buying this at the grocery store whenever i can  since coffee makes me feel ill and energy drinks are costly black tea is my primary source of daily caffeine  getting one measly 30 pack of this tea lasts me a very short time  i practically jumped for joy when i found this was available not only in bulk  but i can subscribe for a regular shipment every 3 months  lets hope it lasts more than 3 months  so excited for this  ,1,0
3046,these peanuts are delicious but the price really went up   i just ordered them in march and the price went up by about 7 or  8 00   very disappointed  price increase,1,0
3044,my girlfriend bought me some of these before with no problem  and i love them  this time however  they came in bubble wrap and not a box  inside where dirty  and one was cracked  i would still buy more  just hope next time they are shipped properly  great vials  bad shipping ,1,0

3042,i had been looking for a coffee pod that would give me a strong cup of coffee  i recently order the melita brand and it was awful  so weak   luckily  i stumbled upon baronet coffee  if you like your coffee rich  dark and bold then this coffee is for you  dark rich bold flavor   ,1,0
3041,usually sticking with brands like stash  tazo  or celestial seasonings  this was my first outing with higgins   burke  the tea s packaging talks about an  intoxicating fragrance   which normally would just be nonsense to help sell a product  but in this case the box blurb is correct  this tea does smell phenomenal   both in the packet and brewed but how does it taste   frankly on its own the taste is a little mediocre and just slightly on the bitter side  there are definitely teas out there much more pleasing to the palette straight out of the box  but throw in a splash of milk  and maybe a little sugar  and you ve got something well worth drinking here that s much more cost effective than getting a chai out at the coffee shop   for something a little different from the standard black or herbal teas  i recommend giving this one a try  smells phenomenal  and with a little milk it tastes great,1,0
3029,purchased saag s german franks from amazon  i don t knowwhat i was expecting since i only have supermarket type franksto base my taste standards on  but what a surprise  the saag sgerman franks are at whole new level for me  the initial taste andfirst bite crunch due to real casings is a real taste treat  the flavor texture  and the satisfying crunch are how real sausages are supposedto taste but sadly  the commercial brands we are exposed to arelacking  compared to these sausages  they are almost twice thecost of store bought franks  but oh what a treat to experience whatgermans have been eating as opposed to us americans  i willforever be jaded eating common sausages  best sausage taste   first bite crunch,1,0
3040,i tried a lot of other things to keep raccoons out of my backyard and failed  this is the only product that worked  the only thing that keeps raccoons away,1,0
3038,the orville redenbacher brand has meant premium quality for decades  and today is no different   this popping corn is designed for use in air poppers  but can be used with oil as well   of course  the advantage of an air popper is that the popped corn leaves the heating chamber and can t burn   unlike popped corn trapped in a microwave bag or in an oiled popper or stovepot with orville  you get consistently large popcorn that stands up to whatever toppings you prefer   you won t do better with off brands  and you don t have to deal with the continually shrinking sizes of microwave bags  which cause you to burn the first bag or two until you figure out what time setting you really need every time the size changes    even if orville costs more than what you can get elsewhere  it s worth it  still the best,1,0
3037,this tea is wonderful  a good blend of vanilla and spices  and a good amount of tea as well however  with amazon s recent price hike  changing the subscribe and save discount to only 5   was 15    this tea is now cheaper at wal mart   i can buy a single box at wal mart for  2 34  including the sales tax  list price only  2 18   and this six box set at amazon now costs  2 42 per box  without sales tax  the tea i would give a 5 star  but downrating to four because it can be bought elsewhere for less   shame on amazon   the bulk rate for six boxes should be competitively priced  at or below what it costs at local stores addendum   amazon must really want to get out of the retail tea business  now a few days later  after i even submitted the  tell us about a lower price  form  informing them of the lower price available elsewhere  amazon instead raised the price of this tea even higher   strange indeed  wonderful tea  but amazon s price is now higher than the local store,1,0
3036,paid  9 62 and it said it equals to  1 47 an ounce and you get 1 76 ounces  which equals out to  5 46 an ounce in my math  i guess next time i need to reorder it ill look elsewhere  awsome pepper but what a ripoff on price ,1,0
3035,picture four cats dancing impatiently and boxing each other in an attempt to be the first to be served friskies cat food flaked with tuna   egg in sauce   you will have a good idea how my cats react after i open a can of the aforementioned cat food   i stick to the established routine as one cat needs medicationed mixed into her food   in any case i put down each cat s plate in a certain order   if i go out of the usual order chaos results   my catstypically gulp down the tuna   egg mixed with dry food in 7 10 minutes   i don t know how they can even taste the food eating so fast  but    i like the fact that i can save money on my cats  food by using the subscribe and save option at amazon   not even walmart can compete with the lower prices i get on food this way  it s fish for breakfast   dinner ,1,0
3034,first off  these are exactly as pictured in the photo so i realize that they have not done anything misleading  but i did not see anywhere in the description that these had a red hem  i was a little disappointed when receiving them  as i am using them in an all blue themed party  not a huge deal   just pay better attention to the photos  other listings had specified if the bags were stitched with a colored hem  this one did not so i thought maybe it was completely neutral  the item description on the actual packing slip that arrived is  3 x5   drawstring with thin red hem   i just wish i had seen that written out somewhere before seeing it on the actual packing slip  otherwise the bags are nice  description not entirely complete,1,0
3032,ordered two of these to rid clutter off my counter   fairly easy installation  just remember to check direction of the pulldown and closeness to any contact walls  husband forgot to do this twice and had to change afterwards   not easy to do but he managed   received lots of compliments from visiting family and friends plus wanting to know where to purchase one too  enjoy not having clutter on counter and this does the job  only gave 4 stars as the directions were a little too simplistic  under cabinet k cup holder,1,0
3031,i m not quite sure how to explain this  because it is water   but there is a kind of a different  taste  to it  and also a different texture as well  i ve not really known much about the ph of water  what should or shouldn t be desired  but somehow  this water was just    different  in the best sort of way  if they sold this everywhere  i d definitely buy it  it is more than worth  investing  in  and you get quite a bit of water  the one bottle i received to try it out lasted me quite a while  for it being a water bottle in addition to a difference in  taste  and texture   i know that sounds weird  but you d have to drink it to get what i mean    and not just chug it  but to really enjoy the water as you slowly consume it   i honestly feel it better hydrates and keeps the body hydrated  i ve not experimented yet  but i could tell that  as active as i was while consuming most of this water   i felt hydrated faster and longer  longer both during the physical activity and afterwards  too  it seemed to replenish  during and after  what i was losing what i had lost in the end  i felt satisfied  the water almost had the same kind of feel that drinking other kinds of vitamin waters with electrolytes have on my body  granted  i wouldn t totally replace those electrolytes with this water  but it seemingly had the same similar kind of feel affect on me i enjoy ed  it and would most definitely recommend someone looking into this and trying it out  tastefully different,1,0
3039,this product was very tasty  not too sweet and not too much banana  i enjoyed the banana nut bread flavor although i am not too crazy about babanas  it taste even better warmed up  good,1,0
3050,if this flavor lasted longer than it does  i d probably die of starvation for lack of wanting to take it out of my mouth  the flavor of the gods,1,0
3007,i d like to give 3 1 2 stars because they aren t quite up to a 4 star rating but slightly better than 3  they taste good  not sickeningly sweet  about the right size  but they re really rough to the tongue  the first one or two i ate  i noticed my tongue felt numb  and i wondered what caused it  then i realized it s the roughness as i sucked on them  so i try to remember to let them more or less melt  but quite honestly  it takes a little of the enjoyment out of suckers  someone else called it grittiness  but i m just not sure what causes it  pretty good,1,0
3005,to those crying about this product  if you wanted equal you should of spent the money and bought equal  not a thing wrong with this product  good stuff,1,0
2983,my cats like it and i know the ingredients are healthy but i am switching back to petguard   petguard has never had recalls and natuarl balance seems to have a lot  usually their dry foods with venison   still  i am not taking chances with my two cats   other than the recall issue  the product is liked by my cats and the ingredients are healthy  no by products  good product ,1,0
2982,several reviewers have downgraded these treats because their cats didn t like them   while i don t doubt this at all  cats being infamous for being finicky  both of my cats like them   they are large enough that i can break off small bits for the two cats  then break the remainder in half for my two dogs these would make nice training treats   they are easily broken into small pieces  are very lightweight  and have very little smell  and what they do have is not objectionable    they are made from  to quote the package   minimally processed freeze dried raw ingredients    they contain no grain the manufacturer recommends feeding these as a  boost  to a pet s diet  1 2 boost bites per day per 20 pounds of the pet s body weight   if i actually fed them this way  they would cost me several times more than my dogs  actual food costs  and i don t feed them cheap food   it s hard to imagine anyone who would want to budget these into their pet s diet as anything more than an occasional treat  cats and dogs both liked them,1,0
2981,i was getting authority lamb through petsmart online because i moved and there isn t one near me   it wasn t cheap with the shipping and not so cheap even without  but my 20 pound shelter dog was doing well on it  so     well  i ordered two bags of authority  one a few months ago and one recently  both came poooorly packaged and were battered and i got a refund on shipping   but this last batch had bugs in it   i didn t notice at first  must have been larvae  but opened up my dog s vittles vault today  only put in there about a week ago  and see bugs crawling in it and the vittles vault had been securely closed   but as the bag and box got here battered  i m sure it was a bug buffet before even reaching me    needless to say  didn t want to feed to my dog and found a pet store open near me on a sunday and they recommended this brand  my dog has a bit of a sensitive tummy and does best on lamb    he loves it   and it s really quite comparable in price and packaged so much better than authority   it also has a much sturdier bag to keep nasty things out until i can get it home and put in a vittles vault   this will be my dog s dry food from now on  found this through a local pet store,1,0
2980,two of my favorite things  extra special together  the product itself is delicious and i love this shortbread combination  this was my second time to order this product so i was looking forward to receiving them  unfortunately  i live in a very warm climate area and the packaging did not compensate for this  so the chocolate melted and much of it stuck to the shortbread package  i was very disappointed about this  other items that i have ordered that might present a similar problem have been package with cold packs and insulation at no extra charge  recently ordered cadbury chocolate eclairs   i rate the product very high but feel the supplier fell short  dark chocolate   ginger,1,0
2979,i loved it but i buy it at the drug store and it comes in 10 pc pkgs   i thought this did too but it was only 4 pc pgks so i didn t get a good a deal as i thought    but it was my fault for not reading rainblo bubble gum,1,0
2978,this pineapple is so sweet   and it s so convenient to have the individual serving sizes   i love pineapple so much that if i open a can  i m likely to eat the whole thing   just make sure you tilt the container backwards so the air bubble is where you peel the film open     and then open it slowly or the juice may squirt out   the other option is to poke a hole with a knife first and then do the tilting thing  but be careful it doesn t leak out of the hole you made   sweet,1,0
2977,i figured that a dog food made with beef and grilled sirloin steak flavor would smell really good to a dog  but i did a little test   i put one dog s regular food in a paper bowl and the new food in another paper bowl  so that the bowls wouldn t interfere with the test   then i put the old food on the floor in its regular place  and i put the new food further away   the dog smelled her regular food first  and then she started sniffing all over in the air until she tracked down the new food   she gobbled that up and then ate her regular food   the next time i put the new food further away  behind the dog food storge container  and she tracked it down and ate it first again before eating her regular food    i divided the food half and half so it would be her regular amount   real beef is our  1 ingredient  it says on the bag   in the list of ingredients that is followed by soybean meal  soy flour and lots of additives  including the dyes and corn products  etc   plus 23 essential vitamins and minerals   green beans and potatoes are listed as garnishes   there are crunchy kibbles and tender pieces  which i m assuming is the beef   it s for adult dogs  and the product is now made by the nestle purina pet care company   a company in switzerland owns the trademarks    i trusted purina  the instructions say to gradually mix the old regular food with the new  which i always do  except for the two tests   btw  while studying the information on the bag and making notes at the dining room table  the dogs were all over me   one wanted to climb up on the table via my lap  fortunately he s short    he picked the beef pieces out of his regular food earlier  it was mixed together   the dogs give it five stars ,1,0
2984,this tea is really premium product  i bought 3 packs last year and should have gotten it again rather then trying  bentley s royal premium black flavored earl grey tea  50 count tin  which turned out to be a total disappointment comparing to  ahmad tea edwardian caddies  earl grey  50 count tin  great presentation  aroma and taste ,1,0
2974,i was interested in this product to help deal with an abundance of chipmunks on my property  as well as stopping raccoons and squirrels from getting into my garbage cans  it has worked in both cases chipmunks  for some reason chipmunks have been in great abundance in my neighborhood  i live in new jersey so my guess is the mild winter had something to do about it   a few chipmunks are nice  more than a few eat flowers and vegetables and make a mess i saw two holes in the ground that the chipmunks  were using as burrows   i poured the critter ridder in and around the burrow holes and it seemed like activity around the burrow holes stopped  i still see some chipmunks but not as many as before raccoons and squirrels   i have half a dozen plastic garbage cans whose covers have holes in them due to hungry squirrels wanting to get at the food in them   i also have awakened on many days to find my garbage cans knocked over but what i am pretty certain were raccoons foraging for food certain foods tend to be more appetizing than others  for some reason chicken and fish and certain fruits like apples and pears tend to attract the squirrels and raccoons more than others but any food is a target to them i have been pouring critter ridder around my garbage cans and it seems to be keeping all animals away   i threw chicken bones out one night and was expecting some animal to try to knock over my garbage can or get into it and nothing happened  i have been using this for three weeks and it has worked i like the idea that this product is natural and will not poison or kill anything   the smell alone is enough to make me take notice and i got some on my hand  which burned a little but i felt fine after washing my hands  the bottle has a handle and an easy pour cover which works great and except for the one occasion i have not gotten any more on me every week or so i pour out some more critter ridder around the burrows and garbage cans  so far this is keeping the critters away  works for raccoons  squirrels and chipmunks ,1,0

2971,doberman puppy had terrible diarrhea on blue buffalo longevity and purina pro plan  this was the last effort before putting him on a hypoallergenic food that would leave his skin dull and lifeless  this has worked wonderfully  although we feed him a little more than recommended due to the lower protein content  cannot complain no diarrhea,1,0
2970,i won t need to buy red food coloring for a long time  we use it in hummingbird feeders because they really do like red despite what  experts  say  however  i might believe the experts that we should not be giving the birds nasty chemicals contained in most colorings  if i ever make chocolate cake  i will be sure to use some of this as sugar to get that fancy red color kids like lately  a great replacement for artificial red food coloring,1,0
2969,if your idea of a cold  bottled coffee drink is something on the order of a starbuck s frappucino  you re going to be disappointed with the illy issimo coffee drink   don t get me wrong  i m a fan of the starbuck s frap  but you don t have to read the ingredients list to realize that both sugar and milk probably come before coffee   although the illy issimo contains a touch of sugar  it leaves you with no doubt that the main ingredient is coffee  strong  espresso type coffee i enjoyed the illy issimo caff eacute   and if you re a veteran coffee drinker who likes espresso  you ll probably like it  too   no  it doesn t compare to freshly brewed espresso  but what does   i drank this cold  straight up  but it has enough flavor to hold its own over ice  too   the small can is reminiscent of the small size of espresso cups   i don t buy ready made coffee drinks very often  partly because i own the mr  coffee frappe maker  mr  coffee bvmc fm1 20 ounce frappe maker  and can whip up a fresh coffee drink quickly and easily  but when i m out and about  the illy issimo caff eacute  will be high on my list of choices  very good,1,0
2968,this review is for pop oolong tea bags  my tea background was first drinking indian milk tea using black loose tea  milk  spices  and sugar  i added far eastern teas  non milk varieties  in my search for a quicker tea to brew  milk tea needs more time to prepare   i am on my 3rd box of pop oolong tea  the tea is not like black or green teas  be prepared for a bitter taste but with a sweeter aftertaste  like black teas  this produces some kind of coating feeling on the tongue  almost similar to eating an unripened banana  it is somewhat woody in taste and smell  maybe a bit flowery  it may also be slightly sour  but less than some green teas  i have tried whole leaf oolong from a chinese shop and that was more like green tea  if you can afford more expensive oolong teas  then you might get better quality  for the price  you re getting a good deal  i also think that the batches vary so sometimes you might get a stronger  bitter flavor but if you experiment with the brewing  you might get your desired flavor to brew this pop oolong tea  realize that ground tea in bags will release their flavors much faster  my solution is to boil some filtered water  after bringing to a boil  i turn off the stove and add 1 cup  237 ml  hot water to the tea bag  then wait  30 seconds  or golden brown color appears and remove the bag  the first cup usually extracts most of the caffeine and is the most bitter and strong taste  now i can brew with another cup of the hot water  i can brew around 4 cups with the colors being golden brown  golden  light green  and very light green  it is best to brew by the color and not the time  if you leave the bag in too long  it will be terribly bitter tea brewing is an art and science  as many other things in life are  please refer to the science of solvent extraction for a better idea  basically  you are extracting the tea s aromatic compounds into the water  the flavor of the brew are mainly affected by water quality  extraction time  the time in water   and water temperature  you have to experiment with this for your preferred flavor  sugar is absolutely not necessary  if prepared correctly  good oolong for the price,1,0

2966,yep i used to get them for free  all you had to do was go out into the field in viet nam  67 68   and they would send a box of goodies  sundries pack  sp   that would have chuckles on the top layer  you guessed it when the box was opened it looked like a shark feeding frenzy  i guess i never got over it and to this day have to have a chuckles fix periodically the sugar coating keeps them from being sticky  the artificial flavors are seductive  the black ones taste like licorice  get them free in your sp pack,1,0
2973,i sprinkled this around my tomatoes and bean plants to stop the deer and squirrels from ruining my garden  so far  this has stopped the critter destruction and thievery   i am finally getting to harvest my tomatoes and it looks like my bean plants are starting to grow again   i like that this is not so horribly scented as some of the other products on the market   this has a very strong black pepper smell instead of a rotting garlic smell  it seems to work as well as many of the other products out there  it has a convenient shaker lid  this is definitely a product worth getting  works  not as obnoxious smelling as others,1,0

2987,i am looking to replace my store brand dandruff shampoo and my coal tar shampoo with something that will work better and be cheaper   i am looking for a basic dandruff shampoo without a lot of extras  i tried the 2 in 1 dry scalp hydration version of this brand which i like but i liked the name of this so i figured iwould give it a try i am pleased so far  this seems to be keeping my dandruff under control without having to use a second product  the perfume like smell in many shampoos which i don t like is not as strong as i thought it would be and after i am done washing my hair i don t notice any lingering smell  a little of this product goes a long way interestingly  both this and the  2 in 1 dry scalp hydration version of this this brand use the same active ingredient  pyrithione zinc  1 0    to treat the dandruff  i have not looked at the other ingredients but the the 2 in 1 shampoo is also a conditioner while this one says it is just a  dandruff shampoo the web page on amazon says under directions that this product should be used twice a week but the bottle says to use it daily  i have used it daily so far i am pleased with this  if i can use this instead of my two other shampoos i will save money as well   i like it a bit better than the 2 in 1 dry scalp hydration version of this brand but both are fine  simple shampoo that works well,1,0
3004,i found these pure alaskan salmon treats at the vet where my kitty was undergoing radiation for skin cancer of the nose   he is white  fair skinned  and all those years of laying in the hot california sun gave him skin cancer of the nose    i am originally from seattle washington and have been to alaska many times   i was thrilled when i found these treats of pure 100  alaskan freeze dried salmon for my cat   i knew they would be a healthy treat that would help his ammune system instead of hurting it   my cat loves them too  he goes crazy when i pull out the bag  and sits in front of the pantry letting me know  its treat time    i am so dissapointed to learn that the salmon is now being flown from alaska to china to be packaged   my cat will be even more dissapointed   please  wildside salmon co   go back to packaging in alaska   even if it is more expensive to buy it would be worth it   the whole reason i bought them   tried them in the first place was because of the fact that they came fresh from alaska  and are 100  pure and healthy salmon   i dont trust products from china and unfortunately my cat will miss these horribly   shannonwildside salmon   wild alaskan freeze dried salmon treats for cats  3 oz   3 pack  what  sent from alaska to china  my cat will be heartbroken he has to give these up ,1,0
3003,this wine actually turned out really well   i made some modifications to the kit however   if you figure out the potential alcohol content  this kit would probably get around 7   but by adding additional sugar at the primary fermentation  i ended up with 13    i also didn t use the whole f pack   it would have been way to sweet   instead  i topped the carboy off with an unoaked chardonnay that i like  this is a good wine but i made some modifications,1,0

3001,what    no one has reviewed this item yet   why the heck not  i didnt buy this item off of amazon  but i did buy it in my local health food store   i have been searching for a good sugar substitute for over a year now that didn t  taste funny  either while your eating it or after   it gets depressing after a while let me tell you   a lady pointed me to this particular brand saying it doesnt have an after taste      hmm   i thought    its stevia  all stevia stuff has an aftertaste   i tried another kind  still stevia  on a higher shelf because it was hazelnut flavored   i was disapointed and threw it away   i came back the next day   the lady smiled at me  and i said i was going to try what she suggested   i took it home and tried it   and i was amazed  the aftertaste was hardly even noticable in comparison to all my other stevia products i ve purchased  i knew i had found what i was looking for   i threw all my white sugars and sweeteners away in the whole house  finally    i have used this in drinks  pancakes  cereals  and it has all been wonderful  my kids use it   well  it is the only sugar left in the house   lol      and no complaints       super happy   try this    you wont be wasting your money  i promise   you may get it cheaper at a store though so check  amazing ,1,0

2999,i recently bought this and received it in the mail a couple of days ago  i was rather impressed at how it was boxed  i ve never bought a plant online so i didn t know what to expect  there were three stems in the bulb  the plant was wrapped snugly with plastic wrap  but unfortunately  one had a tear  and another had the top leave completely torn off  but the third one was good and healthy  the directions were very informative and helpful  i have a venus fly trap so i was lucky to be in good supply of distilled water  i put it in its pot as soon as possible with water  and it seems happy except that the tear one got made it weak  but i m satisfied overall  pretty little things ,1,0

2995,i have somewhat short  fine hair   but a lot of it  and my husband has fine thinning hair   we both occasionally experience issues with dandruff and dry scalp  so i wanted to try this shampoo as an alternative to our usual brand   while billed as  shampoo for men   i found the scent of this shampoo to be pleasant and mild  and not at all  medicine y    the shampoo itself was rather thin  like my regular shampoo  rather than the toothpaste like consistancy of our usual brand of dandruff shampoo   i was very pleased with the results on my hair  it washed away any dandruff i had  and my scalp was totally itch free   this is not a  2 n 1  shampoo  so those with very dry hair may want to follow up with a conditioner  although the formula is not drying  and i don t think conditioner would be needed unless your hair is very dry   overall  this shampoo does what is advertises  which is get rid of dandruff  and it leaves a clean  fresh scent behind   i think this is a very good product  works well  even on ladies  hair ,1,0
2994,i like this product it really tames smoothes and banishes frizz for my hair type which is somewhat coarse and thick as well as dry  like other products in this line i do think this maybe better for ethnic type hair  or just really stubborn hair  the smell is a bit strong but not overwhelming and a little goes along way  the ingredients could be better but all in all it s a ok product   clear scalp hair therapy   ,1,0
2993,shipping was fast  so that was good  plants arrived in good shape  it was a little confusing   not knowing anything about carnivorous plants  to tell that two of the plants were packaged together  the packing slip indicated as suck  but i didn t know what i was looking for  but can see how someone would think they only received 2 plants having said that  the plants arrived in good shape  look healthy and are replanted on my windowsill at work  waiting for bugs  i m looking forward to seeing how the grow  great ,1,0
2992,not too long ago  i bought a packet of hansen s junior water and liked it very much  it was a good drink and had some fruit juice and a little sugar  it was light and somewhat sweet  but not too much  just fine for our little boy  4 years old   junior water for junior  so to speak  well  now i needed another batch so this time i got the fruit punch variety  nice light taste  just right  his doctor warned us not to give him too heavily sugared drinks  these work well gary peterson somewhat sweet  but not too much  these work well ,1,0
2990,call me old  i never thought the day would come when i would buy groceries online  well  friends  the day has arrived because my local store sells out of these eden organic black soy beans just about every time we buy them to make chili  so  i now have a case of them    take that  giant eagle           i now have a new  cheaper  source for this product  for coffee pods  and a lot of the non perishable products that i routinely buy  thanks  amazon  for saving me time and frustration    and money  i never thought   ,1,0
2989,i started buying wheatable crackers in egypt when wheat thins weren t available at my grocery store since then i ve never gone back   they are such a better tasting cracker and just a little softer than wheat thins now that i ve moved back to the us they are nowhere to be found in stores   wheat thins totally own the market here try wheatables today to see if you are like me  and let s see if we can get stores to stock these  wheatables vs  wheat thins,1,0
2988,i bought this tea at dr  oz advice and got the other teas too for weight loss            didn t work  really sorry i bought this but it is good as far as tea goes  i will not be buying this product again as it didn t do what i wanted it to  but it tastes like regular ice tea  it was good tea,1,0
2996,just can t find this out here in ok   had to special order my clam sauce   ahh  just like back east  bon appetit  linguini lover,1,0
3052,we used to feed our dogs  regular  dog food  until we realized it had all kinds of by products and things that not even us humans would want to eat  so we switched to blue buffalo  i usually buy whatever flavor is on sale that week  and they do really well with switching from one flavor to another   as long as we stick to blue buffalo brand  i have noticed with the fish flavor  their coats are shinier  we wouldn t go back to any other dog food  bb is well worth the money  we only buy blue buffalo,1,0
3053,the all natural taste comes with a hefty price and a little bit of a bad after taste   i have since went back to diet coke and perhaps the onslaught of all the bad health unproven  issues associated with it hopefully this is good for me   ,1,0
3055,chef michael s has both soft  not necessarily moist  but soft  meat pieces and harder small pieces  so most dogs should be fine  even if they have a difficult time eating standard hard dog food  the product also lives up to its name with meat being the first ingredient   chef michael s was preferred by my beagle over iams  meat is the first ingredient,1,0
3118,i was feeding this to my dogs but now they do not eat it    i dont blame the product though prolly just need variety they liked it for a while,1,0
3117,another reviewer mentioned that perhaps the price is lower from this seller because the cans of nido are nearer expiration  after receiving my 2 can package in the mail i would have to agree  i have purchased this at the supermarket with an expiration date 12 18 months away  these two  however  will expire just six months from now  just something to be aware of if you are buying this intending it for longer term storage the milk itself is delicious  much  much better than instant nonfat milks  tastes very similar to  real  milk and makes excellent hot chocolate  good product  but not sure about seller expiration date,1,0
3116,this dandruff shampoo isn t harsh on my hair or hair color   i m female  it leaves my hair squeaky clean without drying it out  also the smell isn t  manly  smelling  i thought it might smell like men s products but it doesn t  i actually prefer using this to my everyday shampoo because it cleans gently and removes all the residue from my hair products   i also feel like it keeps dandruff at bay  i don t have terrible dandruff but if you do and your products dry your scalp  it can make it worse  good for women too,1,0
3115,in my mind  to qualify as a  cookie   a food needs to possess two ingredients  sugar and fat  if you reduce or eliminate either or both of those  you no longer have a  cookie   but a sad imitation of one  generally not worth eating  quaker has tried to make a better for you cookie not by reducing its evil components  but by adding other virtuous ones  in this case whole grain oats  this yields a cookie with whole grain and fiber to offset  at least partially  its less nutritious aspects let s look at the numbers of two very classic cookies  three nabisco oreos weigh 34 grams  have 160 calories  7 grams of fat and 1 gram of fiber  three chips ahoy chocolate chip cookies weigh 33 grams  have 160 calories  8 grams of fat and 1 gram of fiber one of these quakers weighs 42 grams  has 180 calories  8 grams of fat and 4 grams of fiber  so you get about 25  more cookie for about the same calories and fat  and you get 4 times the fiber  if they were as good as the other two  you d have a hands down winner  unfortunately  this is where reality intrudes  they aren t on the other hand  they re not bad at all  perhaps just a step behind the nabiscos and keeblers that we all love  if you re like me and have reached that stage of life where you need to be sure to get enough fiber every day  they represent a painless way to get about a sixth of what s needed  and you will feel like you ve eaten a cookie and not a styrofoam imposter  excellent for what it is,1,0
3114,this company markets shampoos specifically to men and some were available to test  i chose this one instead  i like it  there s no artificial perfumes  what little odor there is i assume comes from the cleaning compounds in the shampoo  it cleans well and doesn t leave any sort of residue or wax in my hair  it simply cleans without intruding  what more could i ask  well maybe not the lavender shade  but that s a guy thing  i like it,1,0
3113,this was not bad at all  i had a bad experience with vitacoco acai and pomegranate and it was horrible    it had that strong coconut flavor that i do not like  i had already bought this so i was nervous to try it  i was surprised when it barely tasted like coconut  it doesn t have that typical strong coconut taste  i usually stay away from anything coconut  candy  food  beverages  etc  for some reason it gets me sick  but i wanted to try this  because i heard coconut water is good for you  i already tried the mango  pineapple  and pink guava flavors  they are delicious  pink guava is my favorite  o n e  brand is my favorite  as long as i don t really taste that strong coconut flavor  then i will keep drinking this  i hate coconut but,1,0
3112,to whom it may consern please i had e mailed twice that i did not want anymore pop corn orders you keep sending them why do you that read my lips no more popcorn till i decide i want more  no more no more are you listening i have enough popcorn its coming out my ears so plese no more you got that  juan r perez great northern popcorn 4 ounce packs pack of 24,1,0
3119,i don t usually write reviews  but my disappointment flows over on this matter   they have definitely changed the flavour of the original pemican beef jerky   it is the same great texture  but saltier and with a different flavour from before   maybe it is the bag material   i had an old bag just to check my tastebuds against   i used to look forward to amazon getting stock on these and then buy a bunch up to have on hand   if you read these reviews marfoods  please bring back the old flavour  from the bags talking abut steak   the new bag is a nice design  but i buy beef jerky for the taste   maybe advertise improved taste at some point after you change back so that we know it is safe to buy again   it is still the best texture in a beef jerky and i will still buy some here and there to see if the taste comes back   but i will wait to buy pounds again until the taste is back  i think they changed the recipie ,1,0
3111,this xanthan gum is not corn derived  like the rest of them seem to be   consequently  it is gold plated to a mom whose children are gluten free  lactose free  soy free  dye free and corn free       i don t care that it is more   things turn out much sturdier and nicer using it and my son doesn t have a reaction to it   yes  there is a reason it is expensive    ,1,0
3109,these were very attractive in person   i was disappointed because 3 were broken through  overall they were a good product for thr price  pretty,1,0
3108,love  love  love this stuff but as all the others said  hate the new ones  lipton made a big mistake in discontinuing the citrus and raspberry tea to go  these prices are outrageous and as much as i love it  will not pay this             big mistake lipton,1,0
3107,while there is nothing special to really distinguish this tea from twinnings   stash  or any other better grade commercially available tea  in this case that is not a bad thing  both mrs  boilermate and i thought this was a decent cup  she drank hers plain  and i drank mine both plain and with lemon and sugar  if this were on the shelf when i went to purchase tea  there is a good chance it would end up in the cart  decent cup,1,0
3106,these beef sticks are greasy  decently salty  and have a nice texture  overall i think they re good  but they re insanely unhealthy  they re full of saturated fat  cholesterol and salt  each stick is about 110 calories too  and each package i received has 9 sticks  this is not diet food  it s definitely a junk snack  quality beef jerky  which this is not  is very low in fat  i think i ll stick with jerky in the future  but these were fairly tasty my cat seemed very intrigued by the smell of these beef sticks  she won t eat any kind of human food  even meat   but she actually ate a piece of these and liked it  that got me slightly worried so i think i won t be ordering any more of these  greasy but tasty beef sticks,1,0
3105,we love all of ella s kitchen products  and our baby seems to enjoy this one   we do add a bit of water to thin it out  as the products containing brown rice tend to be a bit too thick for a baby under 6 or so months   i also wanted to point out that in our last shipment of this particular flavor  i noticed a few oddities on the nutrition information   after a bit of searching  i realized that this particular order was  product of canada    not sure if this is at all a big deal  i doubt it   but just wanted to inform the seller and potential buyers   just seemed odd  love ella s ,1,0

3110,this is the best brand of boxed gf mac and cheese you can buy at this time  we have tried at least 4 and none come close to annie s in my opinion the cheese sauce is not the greatest in the world  but it is what it is  apparently you can buy the kraft cheese powder separately and it is gluten free and we have tried that but our kids did not enjoy it as much as the annie s sauce  so maybe the taste is a subjective issue  you could probably do better making your own cheese sauce and buying bulk gluten free elbow noodles  but then you would be defeated the purpose of buying boxed mac n cheese wouldn t you i always wait until they have it for  lt  2 a box and buy a bunch to store  best gf boxed mac n cheese,1,0
3102,this popcorn is great   i got a popcorn machine this past christmas and have struggled to get the  theater  popcorn i ve been wanting   i tried different brands of popcorn including orville  but just couldn t get it just right   either the popcorn would be too crunchy or too chewy   i researched my problem and i thought the kettle was too hot     or maybe it was not hot enough  so i spent days adjusting the thermostat to change the popping temp   i tried more oil  less oil  and still not great i didn t want to spend money on the pre portioned packs  so i thought i d give the paragon popcorn a try   what a difference   tastes good and pops great   nice and crispy  not crunchy  and not a bit chewy in the middle   i ve read on a couple different forums of others having the same problem and a lot of solutions were offered about kettle temp  too much moisture  leave doors open during popping   use less more oil  and let the kettle warm up this or that long   well  i m here to tell all you people having similar issues  try this popcorn   not saying there aren t other brands out there that will work  but this one has done it for me  finally ,1,0
3121,i don t have a trader joe s near me so when i went for the first time  this was something i grabbed for just to try  it s really good but it is definitely not as healthy as a regular nut butter  it has similar nutrition facts to nutella  which has almost no nutritional value at all  don t be fooled because it doesn t contain trans fat and hydrogenated oils  therefore it s healthy for you  it s not  it s mostly sugar and oils  but you have to live a little and at least just have one jar for a nice treat     if only it was healthy,1,0
3123,the dogs benefiting from my sack of beneful live on a small rural place with various forms of other livestock and enjoy a wide variety of the taboo in some circles dog food known as table scraps  because of this  a more filler variety of dog food such as beneful works out well as a way to throw in a little extra nutrition without breaking the bank the picture advertisement of the product has a large picture of an ear of corn alongside other veggies and protein sources  and that is an apt illustration since corn filler is the main ingredient in this food  if you are not getting your puppies plenty of protein from other sources  this mix is not for you but it should work out for the rest of the dog loving public none of the animals had an aversion to eating this product  so i will presume it tasted okay and got a  paws up  in addition to four stars  good filler food,1,0

3143,i read about cacao beans and the health benefits that come with eating them    they are extremely bitter but that is what they are  there is nothing bad about the product itself  but the beans do not taste like chocolate even though i had dared to dream  they are still good for me  however  so i will continue to eat them until the bag is finished  it was my own naivety that lead me to believe i would enjoy eating them  this should not deter anyone who really wants to benefit from all their healthy goodness  not too tasty  but healthy for you equals good ,1,0

3140,notice that lovely black lady in all of the ads for this product  well  about 75  of the u s  population is going to regret purchasing this  unless you happen to be among the other 25  who have round  ultra curly  kinky hair and a dry scalp  mostly african americans  some hispanics  some indians  some jews  and a few whites  irish   italians primarily   you might not enjoy your experience with this  this product is meant for people who have a skin type where they do not wash their hair daily  as it would mean a loss of moisture and this dandruff  most of the population  usually white people  have flat  bone straight  feathery hair with an scalp naturally gets so oily it requires washing at least every two days  if not daily  apply this product will make their hair too oily  and attempts to shampoo it out will be rather difficult  lol  there is a reason why so many call it  grease   there relatively is nothing wrong with this product  apart from the fact that they didn t do a good enough job in letting people know who the target market is  and thus  plenty of people with the wrong hair scalp type ended up suffering with it  perhaps that lovely black lady should have been put on the container to clear up confusion i personally like this product  it is better formulated and lighter in application than most hair products targeted towards african americans  i feel that i can moisturize my entire scalp and not need too much of this product to accomplish that  it also smells a lot better than many of its leading competitor products  e g   blue magic  dax  ultra sheen  another reviewer commented that they disliked the fact that this product because it contained mineral oil  well  mineral oil can be good or bad  depending on your hair type and personal biology  for some people  it dries their scalp out and for others  it locks in moisture  the ingredient itself is harmless and is gras  generally recognized as safe  by the fda  which is the safest an ingredient can get  great product    if you are in the target market ,1,0
3138,it looks like water  it tastes like water  it is water  what i appreciate about this particular product is that you don t taste anything else  no plastic taste  no strange mineral taste  just water taste  i wouldn t mind getting more of it  just because of that  the cheap stuff in the grocery store tastes like the bottle it s contained in  it s water ,1,0
3137,the spice itself is fine but the bottle is not tall and narrow as pictured   instead  it is short and wide   that makes it impossible to store on my spice rack  bottle has inconvenient shape,1,0
3122,i noticed that my 2 year old cat was not eating that much of the science diet so based on the reviews i went out and bought the 2 pound bag of this flavor  my cat like it  she eats a lot more since the switch the antioxidant pieces and all  coat was dull before but now has a shine  cat loves it ,1,0
3136,it tasted very clean and pure  not unlike water  it tasted like i get out of my reverse osmosis water  i didn t feel any different than drinking normal ph balanced water  but i only had one bottle  but i did enjoy the taste i think it is a tad overpriced at more than  2 per bottle  i would rather get a dasani or a smart water at much less than this  tasted pretty good  not worth the price,1,0
3134,the utz select pretzel pieces  honey mustard   onion  really is disgusting   same concept which snyder s perfected but a poor imitation  actually i want to complain to utz  which i have never done with any food company for dissatisfaction but it didn t cost me too much and they know it snyder s lost 1 star because it has high sodium  if you re not washing down gallons of water with this you might get kidney stones   all crunchy snack foods are like that but this one is worth it   also honey mustard   onion is the only flavor to get  i don  know why they bother to put out other flavors because they re not very good   yes  it is subjective to the reviewer that gave it 1 star for being too hard  man  brush your teeth more so you have perfect teeth and gums like i do   get more foods with texture  hardness  and different consistency  fritos twist come in a second to hardest compared to this again  do not get the utz brand that packages it just like this one  way better than the utz brand,1,0
3132,my 4 star rating is for the product quality  my only beef with this is the shipping    11 for a box of 24  totally ridiculous i rate these 4 stars for taste  not quite as good as the real thing  but as close to it as you ll get with a k cup   11 for shipping  really ,1,0

3130,so i didn t know what to expect when trying this product     i suppose i thought i d detect a slightly off or metallic taste  with all the electrolytes added  but i did not though the product advertises itself as  silky smooth  i don t think i d describe it that way   it tasted fine  but not  better  than water  and not any worse if you really are struggling to find water that has some of these characteristics  then i d give it a try   me  i m going to stick with filtered water  because i really couldn t tell the difference  tastes like water  so it s got that going for it,1,0

3126,many men my age have a retreating hairline   mine didn t just retreat  it unconditionally surrendered   many years ago   and left only a few lonely sentinels on the great plain of my balding pate  what hair i have left is a semi circular rear guard on the back of my head and above my ears   and it s sensitive   after a defeat like that  who wouldn t be in fact it s so sensitive that the usual dandruff removing shampoos  the kind that s supposed to make your scalp  tingle  when it s working  irritate my skin so badly that it turns red   or maybe it s just blushing after its former defeat   so i quit using dandruff shampoos   and quit wearing dark shirts and coats as a result along comes clear men scalp therapy  i thought  what the heck  why not try it   the worse that can happen is nothing   or my skin turns the color of fall leaves in the mountains again it s been less than 2 weeks since i started using clear men scalp therapy and already i ve noticed a tremendous difference   it works   not only does it work  it does so without irritating my skin   two weeks and no rash or itching   and no dandruff   yup   this stuff works   it really works   i like it  it works   it really works,1,0
3124,my dog liked the raw boost bites  eagerly eating them out of my hand   she is a treat hound  and likes these as well as any other treat product   my cat ignored the treats  as she does most treat products the advantage to these bites are the fact that they are freeze dried at the factory  and retain a level of freshness until the package is opened   it s a little difficult to open the package  but i was eventually successful without resorting to a pair of scissors  which was nice the smell of the product was as one would expect  with a musky meat  chicken  flavor that presumably is irresistible to dogs  if not cats    not something i d be attracted to  but then again the product is meant to appeal to your animal friend rather than you  my dog liked these  my cat  not so much,1,0
3135,a lot of the roland teas suffer from a distinct lack of flavor  making them all taste sort of the same   but this one is one of the better ones  with a distinct cinnamon taste that is pleasant and not overwhelming at all   if you see this on special  grab it   it s certainly enough tea to last a while or share with others   recommended  one of their better flavors,1,0
3101,i wash my long hair every night  and have to use a conditioner  without fail   i got this clear scalp with the matching shampoo  and am quite happy with it   my hair ends up totally soft and totally tangle free   that s all i ask from a conditioner   oh  it also can t have a heavy perfume smell  because that gives me headaches   this one has a slight perfume scent  and it doesn t linger  so that works  no tangles        ,1,0
3100,my husband and i have been on a gluten free diet for a few years now   the texture of some of the gluten free breads and most of the gluten free pasta s is not satisfactory to us   the majority of the pasta s we tried were mushy   yuk   but hearland s pasta products are far from that   they are the closest thing to  real  pasta that we have found   we can even eat them as left overs  which we could not do with the mushy pasta s   i used to buy heartland s pasta s at wal mart at a much cheaper price than i am buying it at amazon for  but they stopped carrying it   it is worth the exta money that it costs not to settle for mushy pasta  though  finally  a gluten free pasta that is not mushy ,1,0

3074,i m not a hair expert  but i do have medium length hair  and use conditioner a couple times a week   this conditioner seemed to do the same thing as all the other conditioners i ve tried   nothing to help it stand out above the crowd  but also  nothing terrible about it   i can t attest to the scalp nourishing factor  besides the fact that i rarely have dandruff  and didn t get it while using this product  didn t seem too much different to me,1,0
3073,when i sample a tea for the first time  i do so black  no sugar  milk  or other additives  i also brew according to directions given on the package in order to set a base line for taste  this english breakfast had a lovely rich aroma  but was actually much milder than i expected  not unpleasant  nor left an unpleasant aftertaste adding sugar didn t dimish the flavour  but adding a splash of milk  unfortunately  did  it wasn t egregious and after some experimentation i found the perfect balance of milk and sugar  but this still isn t one of my favourite sachet english breakfast blends  that honour remains with stash and twinings  but i would have no problem recommending it to folks who might prefer a lighter  but not overly so  blend of black tea  nice blend  but milder than expected,1,0
3071,i agree with some of the other reviewers  for the non classic syrup   i have been buying this product  mostly to add to coffee  for several years  at some point  i noticed that the flavor changed  and  to my palate at least   it was a change for the worse  after noticing some of the recent reviews  i made sure to order the  classic  flavor when my supply started to run low  when it arrived  i taste tested vs  the  non classic  syrup that i still had on hand  and  again  to my palate   the  classic  tasted far superior  i suppose other people may prefer the new flavor  but for me  the classic is the one i ll order from now on   classic  is much better ,1,0
3070,we got the raw boost bites in chicken flavor   although my dogs will eat anything  they were especially excited about these treats the quality of ingredients is excellent   no grains  just freeze dried meats  fruits and veggies  with some spices  and preserved with vitamin e   they smell very chicken y  moreso than conventional treats   the freeze drying gives these biscuits an odd texture  kind of like cardboard   they hardly weigh anything while the quality is good  there are a couple of negatives   first is the cost   my box only contained 18 treats   i have two big dogs  so if i gave them each three cookies day  not unusual   this box would last us    three days   second  while the size is fine for a larger dog  you d have to break them for a smaller dog   this makes a huge  crumbly mess   third  after eating one  both dogs do this weird smacking thing with their tongues for a full minute  as if part of the treat is stuck to the roof of their mouths   i don t know if this is bothersome for them  but it drives me insane overall  i m giving this 4 stars based on the quality of ingredients  but i would not buy these because they re just not economical   i don t want to spend  20  week on dog treats  sorry  doggies    good quality  but expensive,1,0
3069,absolutely the most smooth and chocolatey of almost all local and global chocolates  okay  except for the ones made and sold in belgium   i bought the box for a friend but kept all the bars for myself instead   too good to give away  maybe i ll buy another box for him and ship it directly so i m not tempted again       it doesn t get better than this,1,0
3067,we purchased the curo bag popcorn bags 500 1 5 oz  for a benefit carnival in a park  the size was good  not too much  not too little  popcorn bags worked great ,1,0
3066,i did not have any problems receiving an inferior product  i applaud this company s use of bpa free cans  but the use of guar gum seems unecessary  whenever i open a can it has separated  so the guar gum doesn t seem to be doing what it is intended to do  so why not leave it out and sell an additive free coconut milk  i would like one that is both bpa  and additive free  arrived as ordered,1,0
3075,i was pleased with this brand of k cup coffee   instead of coming in a small plastic  not very green   container it comes in a mesh like pouch making the coffee flow through it easier   i have a hundred dollar keurig machine and it stopped making coffee from the plastic containers   coffee everywhere   i was ready to throw it out in disgust until i tried this new model of single brewing cup   the taste is bold  although i prefer bolder  but it is fresh  dependable and works everytime  san fran bay coffee,1,0
3065,i ve been using neutrogena t gel terapeuthic shampoo  original  4 4 fluid ounce for years and have had mixed results   at times it would seem to work  but other times i would still have an itchy scalp and dandruff    anyone with dandruff knows how embarrassing it can be   i ve also used head   shoulders  but it didn t seem to work well for me either i ve been using this clear men scalp therapy shampoo for the past 2 3 weeks and have been pleased with how well it has worked   my scalp has felt less itchy  dandruff hasn t been noticeable  and my hair feels almost as silky smooth as if i used pantene my complaint with this product has do with the packaging   the item came in a padded envelope   when shipped  as much as 1 4 of the shampoo had leaked all over   the cap just isn t secure enough   even after washing the bottle off  turning it upside down would result in leakage   despite the flaw in the packaging  i would still recommend this product    but consider purchasing this at your local store instead  goodbye itchy scalp,1,0
3062,this clear and clean smelling hair beauty cream surprised me  one thing was tht it as a classy color   the packaging that matches almost any bathroom without sticking out like a neon sign  the other was there was no loud perfume smell or ugly coloring  it does what it says    nourishes your scalp which helps during drying weather without making your hair a greasy mess  yes  yes  and yes i will continue to use this product  i like it ,1,0
3061,    is just as delicious   when i was a kid  these were sold as scooter pies   i believe moon pies was the original name  but locally  new jersey  these were branded as scooter pies  named after ny yankee shortstop phil rizzuto  who was nicknamed  the scooter  whatever their naming legacy  these are every bit as delicious as i remember as a child   coated in sweet chocolate on the outside  soft graham cracker like  pies  on the inside  layered with soft  gooey marshmallow these are pretty large by today s standards  so one is plenty as a snack  and some kids may be fine with half of a  pie    each pie is 2 75 ounces  big enough to fill the palm fingers of your hand   they are not a healthy treat  at 300 calories each  and containing 7 grams of fat  5 of which are saturated   they have no trans fats if you want to give your kids a taste of something you ate as a child  and give your taste buds a taste of nostalgia  try these whether you knew them as moon pies  scooter pies or something else  these are every bit as good as when you were a kid  a rose by any other name        ,1,0
3060,yea  those who claim these bars are not  real  pemmican are right  the original stuff was a mix of dried beef and rendered fat  sometimes with whatever local berries could be found  even those who ate it regularly hated it   mostly voyagers and the like  those who whine that this is not real pemmican are clueless  in 1830 or for that matter 2012  meticulously prepared meat based pemmican still can go rancid  in fact  it will go rancid  it was mostly an emergency fall back ration better by far were the old wilson meat bars of the early  70s  the us military still uses something similar in some of their mres  sadly i can find no source for the bars any more if you make and seal pemmican meticulously with a vacum pump heat sealer they may stay eatable for a week in hot weather  i would not count on it  it is also a very pricey item to make  even from scratch if you want a meat based product that is close to the original  buy one of hundreds of small shelf stable sausages such as salami  pepperoni  summer sausage  etc  large groceries handle dozens of varieties  i have even seen low fat varieties such as pepperoni  there are also smaller items like slim jims and their fellow travelers for smaller meals or smaller appetites  i have seen them in like 3 ounce servings up to eight or so ounces  beyond that  they get huge  they are all quite fat heavy as was the original item   not real pemmican    ,1,0
3059,tastes fine and is definitely good if you need to reduce your carb intake  just be careful to not eat too many or you will find that it acts like a stool softener lubricant  not fun    also  don t let you dog get into these  it is lethal for dogs  tastes fine but don t eat too many,1,0
3058,are you kidding me   i can t even begin to list all of the ways i use this amazing coconut oil   it would be easier to list what it is not good for   let me think    uh    nothing  coconut oil for everything,1,0
3057,this tea has a lovely flavor  some green teas have an off flavor   not sure how to describe it  maybe a little bitter   but this one is nicely complemented by the peach and passion fruit   the fruit flavor doesn t taste artificial and is not overwhelming  almost reminds me of a paradise passion fruit black tea i used to buy  i will definitely be ordering this again  delicious,1,0
3056,a few months ago i originally purchased the strawberry banana flavor  i personally though the taste was awful and the texture was so thick it was disgusting  i couldn t even swallow it straight out of the package  i had to chew on it and swish it around my mouth with water and then force it down my throat  i let one of my friends try it and we had to stop the workout because the taste made him sick  however  the vanilla flavor does not have any of those problems  the flavor is great and you can really taste the vanilla flavor  one of my friends thought it was a little on the sweet side but i love it  it is also a lot thinner  i can easily stick it in my mouth and gulp it down without wasting any time  gu is good stuff  i can feel the difference on longer rides and it definitely helps me maintain my level of performance  gu is good stuff ,1,0
3063,having a minipoodle diagnosed with allergies is no fun   when the allergy turns out to be chicken  even more so got these for shannie and at first whiff she said  no    oh lord is this special or what    i have six boxes then i offered a cookie to leo   he followed shannies lead  sniffed and said  no thanks  broke cookie in half offered half to each pupper and they gobbled them down  looks like we have breakfast cookies weird puppies    lol i must add  the box is full of crumbs  cookie dust and crumbles  she s eating them,1,0
3076,i liked the way this conditioner made my hair feel but i m not sure if it did much for my scalp  at the price of the conditioner  it s certainly a value for what you re getting  but if you want a good scalp nourisher  you might want to explore another route i ve used this conditioner around the same time as two other clear scalp   hair products  maybe it s because i m not an expert  but i didn t see much of a difference between the three  they are great values though if your scalp is dry to the point that you might want to seek a more effective solution  i doubt this product will cure your problems  that doesn t detract from it completely though  it s still a nice conditioner  good conditioner,1,0
3077,bought this foojoy lunching green tea here but to me it was not fresh  i could tell it was not fresh when after a few months the tea starts looking much darker in the cup  so for me  i now buy my foojoy tea direct from foojoy where i have never had a problem getting it fresh and lasts 6 months to a year before getting old turns dark  so far as the tea itself goes  its good tasting tea along with the foojoy china green and organic china green  ok   but  with a caveat ,1,0
3078,this creates a flavor just like the real thing  unfortunately like the real thing  it was partly hardened when i first tried to get some out  but it was pretty easy to massage the package and loosen it up to get out one teaspoon which was all i needed  they tell you what the equivalents are  but i can t remember  it s on the package  this is a great brown sugar substitute,1,0
3098,i have pale skin  blue eyes and light yet thick hair  i used a tiny bit of this product on my hair   not the scalp mind you  but the ends of my hair   maybe a dime size of it  it seemed to make the ends really nice  i am not sure if that is the use of it  for products in this line seem to not have directions  or they say to treat the hair with it  so it really isn t a scalp product   unless you have a really dry scalp and use a very small amount of this  maybe i am one of the odd ones or just have intensely dry hair,1,0
3097,this is such good tuna   i ve bought kirklands brand albacore for years   this product is even better   well worth the price   clean  solid tuna   nothing worse than mushy canned tuna   i d rather have peanut butter   jelly  the perfect canned tuna ,1,0
3096,it arrived on time in a paper bag  there were 35 different k cups  2 hot chocolates  1 cider  2 teas  2 decaff coffees  and the remainder different regular and bolds  some were flavored  many were  name  brands like wolfgang puck  no one company had more than 4 k cups  none were expired  though they didn t all have an obvious date   none were bizarre flavors  it was exactly as described  35 different k cups,1,0
3095,little lulu  my six month old miniature scnauzer  developed foul breath  it reeked like a dead fish  and i couldn t handle her puppy kisses any more   then  i saw an ad on tv for a competing product  but found these to be a better deal  they are worth every penny the teenie greenies arrived yesterday  just one solved the problem  i gave it to her half expecting her to turn her nose up  instead  she loved it  this morning she greeted me with sloppy kisses and wiggles  i instinctively cringed  waiting for that fetid smell  but there was no smell  zilch  zip  nada  i am not exaggerating   ,1,0
3092,whats there to say about a fantastic chocolate chip cookie  the only thing that could be improved is if they offered a bushel box of these so you would not run out so fast  hope these don t go the way of the dinosaur  hey ,1,0
3090,when i was drinking this tea  it felt oddly reminiscent to me   i remembered where the flavor was from   tazo berryblossom white tea   one of my favorites  it tastes exactly the same  and i believe it s even caffeine free    so if you re looking for a cheaper substitute  give it a try   white tea berry blossom   20   bag suggested substitute,1,0
3089,ok  this sounds greedy  but one day  a friend and i were out for a nightly stroll  you know  getting our exercise on   we came to this health food store  where i bought these for the first time   um     i finished the whole bag before we got back to her house  and then i came here an ordered a whole damn box of these these are the lightest chips i have ever tasted   they are not greasy at all   and have just the right amount of seasoning on them   for anyone who has ever fried anything in coconut oil  you might agree that foods you fry simply turn out crispy and light   i am assuming this is the same case for avocado oil  and we see this in the taste of this chip oh  that box of chips   lasted me about a week   ya  oink   enjoy yours  some tasty chips,1,0
3088,i am not sure if this line is ethnic or not   i am not going to make that assumption based on the model used for the product line   i don t think anyone should rub a generous amount of this into their scalp   i use a tiny bit of it for my ends and it reminds me a bit of john frieda frizz ease extra strength serum  1 69 ounces but a little thicker   i am not sure if i should be putting mineral oil in my hair   my hair is naturally blondish red and very thick and curly  so this works for what i need  only a tiny bit though  like a pea size for all my ends  another product that works for me  but only on the dry ends of my hair,1,0
3087,as someone who tried many sweeteners  i was tempted to try necrtesse   in a nutshell  it seems to vary sweetness from one beverage to another   i had to put several packets in a regular cup of tea to make it sweet  but not too sweet   i then tried using it with peppermint tea   usually i do not need much sugar with my peppermint tea  but for some reason it made peppermint tea turn a tad bitter   i guess this was a case of aftertaste   in other words  this sweetener was all over the place on a sweetness scale   that being said  i would still prefer this sweetener over aspartame  sweetness seems to vary ,1,0
3086,i ordered this in august 2012 and when it got to me  it had the best by date of july 13  2012  i didn t realize this until after i had fed my baby this a few times  it didn t seem to make a difference with her  no bad reactions  and i did taste it too and it tasted fine  i will probably dump the rest out but this tastes really really good i enjoyed it myself and my daughter will wolf this down  it s so good that now if we give her straight pear  she won t eat much of it this is definitely really good and the ingredients are all natural without extra unnecessary chemicals in there  it has broccoli  spinach  pears  etc  i actually can understand the ingredients overall  this is really yummy and babies will love this but just beware to check the date on it right away as it may be expired  really good but beware of expiration date,1,0
3085,i received this salsa today  based on the reviews  i was hoping for something i could barely eat  i am a heat freak  what can i say   this salsa is good  it has great flavor and packs some good heat but to call it insane is a bit of an over statement  another reviewer mentioned it would take a few months to eat a whole 12oz jar  i bet i go through this stuff in less the 2 weeks  don t get me wrong this stuff is hot  if you are not used too hot stuff this will probably send you running for the hills  however for someone like me its just hot  not super hot and certainly not  insane   i have had some ghost pepper chili that made me almost hallucinate  im not kidding   that is what i was expecting from this salsa  i ate 6 8 tortilla chips that were fully coated with this salsa and sucked em down without even something to drink  again  i dont want to come down on this salsa because it is good  i just want those true chili heads out there to know that its not insane compared to our standards enjoy it  its tasty  just not insane  hot  yes    tasty  yes    insane  no,1,0
3084,bought it after reading extra virginity  the sublime and scandalous world of olive oil  which talks at length about the decarlo family and their oil  this stuff you can  and i did  drink neat  and enjoyed the experience  i then made the mistake of trying the whole foods house brand the same way    a mistake i am not likely to repeat  a revelation,1,0
3083,both my dogs  a 20 pound mutt and 30 pound welsh corgi  happily chewed on these  and unlike other reviewers  neither my dogs have not gotten sick   it could have been a bad batch out there   which even happens with people food  i will not hesitate to give these to my dogs again    they seemed to really enjoy them  dogs loved it ,1,0
3082,this tastes so much like the southern tea that i am used to that i must say i cannot do better myself  cannot do better,1,0
3081,i bought this because i tend to like chocolate coffees   that said  this one was a little too bland for me  mostly chocolate,1,0

4202,from great river s site certified organic non gmo grainsfrom our facebook page  i get questions regarding the gmo status of our products so i thought i would post here for our friends  all great river organic products are produced from non gmo grains  it is true however that there is some cross pollination that occurs in nature especially in corn so while the planted seeds are non gmo you can pick up traces of gmo in testing  typically these are at a very very low percentage   all non gmo grains,1,0
4203,i keep this in my fridge   when i first tried almond butter i purchased another brand and can t remember the name   i put it in the refrigerator and every time i opened the container the oil had separated and risen to the top  and it was hard to mix the oil back into it   i don t have carpal tunnel or arthritis and work out regularly  so the fact that it was very hard to mix the oil back in was aggravating and i threw that container away i was at the grocery store and saw this brand and decided to give it a try   i read ingredient labels as less ingredients typically mean less processing  and i try to eat more unprocessed and lightly processed foods than processed foods   the label for justin s states the ingredients are  dry roasted almonds  organic palm fruit oil  i have been using the 16 oz container for over a month now and the oil hasn t separated once  tastes great  only 2 ingredients   the oil doesn t separate out,1,0
4204,i m sorry the other buyer felt ripped off   as she says  it was her problem   as for taste  i buy this online because my ralphs doesn t carry it and it is the only peanut butter i will buy because of its amazing taste  taste superb ,1,0
5283,i got one at the venue of my fist half marathon  the product overall claims to be very nutritious and natural  i admit that it mostly stands true to its claim and  more importantly  whole grain oats are fairly chewable and like that fact that it retains its natural texture too  as other reviewer has pointed out  taste is very well balanced  neither too sweet nor too bland  it comes with nice ziplock bag with all those printed claims that gives impression as if its a sole survivor of past  age of raw food  and boasts of not having ingredients that any unprocessed food should not have  neverthless  it keeps granola fresh  may not be able to convince gmo free community since label has no mention of it  i am sure these guys would put it in billboard fonts if it were  d   good product,1,0
5282,this gum is so fresh and not at all stale  got it fast and will order more from this buyer extra sugarless gum,1,0
5280,i like this product  it is very good  very tasty  it is a versatile product that can be served as is or combined with other foods however  i am very disappointed with the way it was shipped   another item by the same manufacturer was shipped together with this one in one box with not enough packaging material to keep them from jostling about nine of the twelve cans are dented  two of the 4 bean salad cans are dented  the box had too much free room and one corner was open and had it needed to be shipped further  the contents would have fallen out as i said earlier  the product is good but order it by itself so a lazy packer doesn t just shove it into a box with other products with only one strip of air pillow packaging material which was totally inadequate i still haven t decided if i will order it again   i had to discard one of the cans because both the top and bottom were dented so much a can opener could not be used  the product is very good but the packaging was bad,1,0
5279,i got a sample of this in the mail  along with the caramel memento coffee i coudln t taste much of a coffee flavor here   if i didn t know better  i would have thought this was a hot cocoa beverage  without the sugar   what i really like about the two memento flavors i tried is that they don t use too much sugar  unlike most of these types of coffee drinks   they kept the sweetness turned way down   unfortunately for this particular mocha flavor  i didn t taste much of any flavor   was it coffee   not that i could tell  was it chocolate  mocha   i would have been hard pressed to say exactly what flavor it was had i not already known it was supposed to be mocha however  it was pretty good anyway   it was very creamy tasting   this one won t compete with any starbucks offerings  but it s ok  because there is a hint of something along with the cream  i m just not sure what the other flavor i tried  the caramel one  was delicious and i will purchase that   this one let me down  but i still enjoyed it  very good,1,0
5278,i m stuck on this  cans are better  more lemon taste but them the price is sky high on the 22oz cans i switch to this  almost as good as the 20oz cans,1,0
5277,plus another five stars i bought this before as  hot peppar  mustard  but i guess they wanted a  hotter  name   no fear  they didn t change the product  just the name   the secret is tabasco sauce  but they do it just right you never tasted hot dogs better than this  but don t forget the onions  plochman s flavored yellow mustard  chicago fire  10 5 ounce squeeze barrels  pack of 6 ,1,0
5276,normally  this columbus salame is great    but lately  there seems to be a problem with just  getting the paper off of the salame      i so don t like eating paper w my italian salame  but it doesn t come off  unless you either peel or cut half of the meat off off of the product to get it off    not good    somebody is taking shortcuts with this product  and eventually causing good paying customers who love italian salame  to look elsewhere for their  italian salame addiction     lol    the product itself is still good    it s just becoming  too hard to get to   for the money   i ve been eating italian dry salame for over 30 yrs  now  and i prefer the columbus brand  for its consistency    it is  simply put  a superior product  minus the paper issue    so   i m taking away  1 star  from the rating because of the  paper  problem  columbus salame,1,0
5284,these lids were just what i was looking for   they re nice  heavy rubbber and easy to get on and off   and they held up to a bit of chewing from my puppy who got one the other day   if it was a plastic lid i m sure it would have been ruined by the time i realized she had it   not one tooth mark on this lid   they re a bit pricey and i would prefer not to have the spoon slot on them but they fit the dog food cans which is more than i can say about the hartz mountain ones i purchased several months earler  great lids,1,0
5275,steaz is an every day staple for me   both the orange and berry are good though i typically get the berry   i have had both the zero calorie and the one with sugar   i am not fond of the one with zero calories   the flavor is not appealing   consequently  to help lower sugar intake  i still buy both but mix them half and half   frankly  i think if they came out with a stevia version  i might have a reason to give this product a 5 star rating  steaz could improve with one change   ,1,0
5273,the first box i ordered had every flavor they make  and two of banana and two of peach the second box i ordered  because it stated it included mango  had no mango but if you read the fine print  it states you may not get what you re ordering  seriously  the way it is worded they could ship you a box of pixie sticks and you acknowledge you have no legal right or recourse  regardless what they send you  but  in the grand scheme of things  hi chew is the best candy on the planet next to chocolate  so i m happy to get it for ten bucks delivered  it s hard to be too sad when you have hi chew in your mouth  no mango  no banana ,1,0
5272,i use this sweetener in my coffee   friends told me they thought it had an aftertaste but i really didn t notice it    i smoke    maybe that s why not sure about the 140 servings but you don t need much and i ve had it for a while and still have some left the container is great   an opening for a spoon on one side and an opening for pouring on the other i would recommend this product thank you mef maybe a bit of an aftertaste ,1,0

5268,i agree with the other reviewer  these are a bit much of cloves  however  if you have ever had pumpkin pie before  and liked it  than you will like these   they are lacking the sweetness you might of thought  yet looking at the ingredients there is not much sugar in them   they have a really good taste though  as pumpkin pie does   these would be great in or on a pumpkin pie with the added flavor  or even added to some ice cream   if you have a sweet tooth  than perhaps these are not for you   if you like the musty and pungent taste of pumpkin and pumpkin pie   enjoy  great item ,1,0
5267,this is a condensed soup so i thought it would just be  eh   but the first ingredient in this soup is  clams and clam juice   so i decided to give it a try  i actually enjoyed it  truly puts the big brands to shame  best canned soup i ever tasted,1,0

5303,i have mixed feelings about this product   the pita chips are tasty  being flavorful and lightly salted  however  they are very hard   i feel like i m consuming slate when eating these   most of the chips are comprised of the two sides of the pita  pocket  layered together solidly   a few of the chips are just one half of that  one side of the pocket   and those are not too hard   if you like bagel chips  you might like these   i would say these are even harder than bagel chips  but they are similar the other problem i have with this product is that there are many broken chips in the bag   it appeared that at least one half of the chips had shattered into tiny pieces   these pieces are too small to do anything with  except maybe throw them on top of a casserole   but that s not what you are paying for in this product   i might have just gotten some badly mangled ones  but because these are so brittle  i can see that they would shatter easily   so i just wanted to warn others that you might only get about one half value out of the bag  in terms of chips being a reasonable size   even the usable chips vary a lot in size and shape these do taste good  and i m disappointed that otherwise i find them unpalatable  because these would be great for hummus   but if you like a very hard  brittle sort of snappy chip  you might enjoy them  tasty rocks,1,0
5302,the product itself is great but it didn t come in the packaging i expected  it s actually small individual packages  lots of waste of paper and aluminium and not as many gum as i thought  good but not what s on the picture,1,0
5287,my family is gluten free because we have to be  i ve used this product several times with great success  last night i wanted to make a cake but didn t have any frosting mix and the butter was hard and i didn t want to wait for it to soften  so i made the mousse and chilled it  then used it as frosting on the cake and jam for between the layers  this cake won t survive breakfast even  instead of frosting and gluten free,1,0
5301,just what i wanted for my portuguese water dogs  keeps them busy for hours  lots of chewing for the 8 mon old  puppy  small pcs piggy ropes,1,0
5299,my little ones love seaweed and rice and this seaweed did not disappoint other brands are too oily or salty or not enough   this one though is just right i would be buying it again    and again  seaweed and rice,1,0
5298,the product itself is very good   i prefer it to many other brands i have tried  it has more true chicken flavor and doesn t taste articial like the other brands   the service  on the other hand  leaves something to be desired   the product was advertised and priced as a 3 pack  but only one was shipped   hard to figure out what went wrong   i have to say that once i got through amazon s convoluted process for talking with a live representative why doesn t amazon want to make it easy for its customers to talk to a live person   what do they have to hide    they were quick enough to provide a prorated rebate for the unshipped items  good product  lousy service,1,0
5296,i tried this on a recommendation of a friend from work   well  i can honestly say that i am so happy i took her advice   while i guess i knew people could have parasites i just never thought about the fact that i might have them well after taking this for two cleansing periods  each ten days  i can tell you that i have much more energy than before and i just plain feel better   in the past i would frequently have stomach pain and sometimes diarrhea   in my mind i always thought this was because of my diet or stress levels at work   right after i finished the first bottle i realized that this was not happening near as often as before i would also get a small cold sore in the corner of my mouth at times   it happened so frequently that i would keep a tube of abreva at work and at home   the cold sore has not come back since i finished the first bottle   people have also commented that my skin looks healthier   one of the younger women in my office even asked me if i had changed my face cream or been to the spa for a facial   that really blew me away   i would never have thought that a parasite could cause a cold sore or make you skin look more aged  but i guess it can when i was taking the pills i did have times when i would have bad smelling gas and a somewhat uncomfortable feeling before having a bowel movement  but neither problem was very bad   a couple of times i felt nauseous too   maybe this was when the parasites  worms or whatever dying in my system   but none of the problems were very bad and definitely not bad enough to make me sorry i took the cleanse   i am really impressed and happy my friend recommended this to me  i was impressed,1,0
5293,nice and crisp  they are shaped like american french fries  i would not call them hot  they are not hot at all like some indian snacks that i have eaten  there is plenty to eat in the package  they do not taste greasy like potato chips  nongshim shrimp cracker,1,0
5291,my dogs are crazy to the point that they get me in the area where its at and look at the direction of where they smell it and then look at me with this curious look on their face  ever since i have been using plato products  my dogs are feel like they are being spoiled  dogs goes nuts ,1,0
5290,they dont seem to have this product anymore it was my favorite flavor but cinnamon seems to be dying her in maryland no cinnamon tic tacs no cinnamon gum   didnt last long,1,0
5289,this hamburger helper was different and good  to bad they stopped making it  if you remember the instructions from hamburger helper you can buy the general mills betty crocker specialty potato cheesy hashbrown  3 7 ounce  pack of 12  and make them with the hamburger the same way  the instructions were just browning the meat before you add the box  do they all taste the same to you ,1,0
5300,we really like this product  it came in a number of smaller packs  and there was a plastic tub for open bags  i did not have any trouble keeping the coffee fresh  the taste and quality were very good  similar to s bux verona  at a lot lower price  i would purchase this again  any time  better than expected,1,0
5309,so i got this here turkish delight box  these are in my opinion a step away from your average turkish delight  not that i am a seasoned t d consumer  but they are more than anything just too soft   just like winegum even though they are much easier to chew up if you will  and therefore reminiscent of eating plain candy even though they have a very good quality consitency and taste  these come largely without any nuts inside  maybe the odd bite though  but the sugar coating is excessive and may upset your tummy  don t eat to many of these at any one time  ye be warned  i think i would try to open them up and maybe let them sit a few days to become dry    more chewing resistance  even maybe try to get wrid of some of that sugar coating   anyway i like the way the box opens  side opening with a nice drawout feature and neatly wrapped in a thin plastic foil  so basically these come plain  with the odd bite with some nuts inside  not my favourite  too little fibre maybe  delicate ,1,0
5264,i was kind of hesitant to order nick s sticks after reading about how they don t exactly taste  right   however i am very pleased i did  these grass fed beef sticks actually taste better than your tradition slim jim type meat sticks  everyone of course is entitled to their own preference  therefore if you are accustomed to the drugstore brand type of meat jerkey s or sticks  then you may find nick s stick s a little off putting  these taste natural with no nitrites  msg or preservative like artificial tastes that you typically get with a lot of other dried meat snacks  and contrary to what the other reviewer said  you can definitely taste the sea salt in this  maybe not much of the other herbs but it s okay because i like my flavor a little bit stripped down to the essentials and not covered up with different flavors that overlap one another better than expected,1,0
5262,i read the reviews before i bought it  and definitely did not regret  i became a fan of jasmine pearl right after the first sip of this tea  before i had an impression that flower teas are the cheaper tea   now i have purchased three orders of the two tin package  and am continually purchasing them every other month  just after i thought about a subscription  i saw the subscribe and save function in amazon  it s briliant  maybe that s what i will do next  love it and might be making a subscription,1,0
5239,the spiced tea from big train is an excellent product   we had already known that from a previous purchase and hence no hesitation in buying it in two large cans on this particular order  the cans got damaged in shipping and were returned to the supplier by the shipper   apparently  there is no straightforward way for amazon to be made aware that the product was returned to the supplier   once i contacted amazon via e mail and advised what happened  i got an immediate response and the product was immediately reordered and delivered in short order   i was concerned that this might end up being one of those situations where no one takes responsibility  and the buyer is the one who ends up losing out   not in this case we will enjoy our spiced tea throughout the cold chicago winter  great service,1,0
5237,i am very dissappointed that i paid this price for the product  i discovered that walmart has the same product online for  7 42  krusteaz krusteaz buttermilk pancake,1,0
5236,lexie is a picky little dog  she doesn t like many brands of dog food  and turns down most offers of dog biscuits  etc   but she eats the beneful   and that s good    no dog food is healthy if the dog doesn t eat it   she does eat certain shapes flavors of bits first  but she eats them all   they are smallish kibbles that would probably work for just about any size dog but i wasn t thrilled to see that the main ingredient is corn   i like that this food has both animal and vegetable ingredients  but would prefer to give lexie more animal protein and less corn   i consider corn a grain  not a vegetable  not something that dogs are designed to eat  but given the price point  overall i think this is a reasonable choice   3 stars from me  5 stars from the dog   4 stars  picky dog likes it  picky dog s people not impressed with ingredient list,1,0
5235,i found nothing wrong with this product  though  the original review i wrote here  was intended for another product  for which i am rewriting it for that product  again    wouldn t do any amazon customer a disservice to purchase both  and see which they prefer    speedy excellent service,1,0
5234,i just finished my second box of the dark choco cherry cashew  im over in a hot box so i knew they would arrive somewhat melted  so i threw them in the freezer and they were amazing  if you have kids i dont recommend freezing them but if not you should try esp if they arrive melted they harden up  no mess at all   try frozen,1,0
5233,i saw this item in the lehman s  amish  catalog and got it from amazon prime to save postage  very nice quality  my measurements indicated that the model 100 would fit and it did  i ll never have to mix up the almond butter with a knife again  no effort or mess  fits trader joe almond butter jars,1,0
5232,i was really hoping for 4 bottles of hot sauce that would be out of this world  what i got were two the green and the red were so boring that i could be more impressed with average supermarket hot sauce  the sudden death and after death however had me sweating and breathing heavy these also come with 2 cool keychain skulls that have blairs stamped on their heads  cool extra value  the  hot and mild  are equivalent of tobasco ,1,0
5240,if i buy vanilla extract it is either mccormick or watkins double strength  if you follow the directions sent with the beans your extract will most likely not be as good as those i made about 20 different batches  all in 50ml bottles  aged 2 months  you need a smooth vodka like  monopolowa potato vodka  to make an excellent basic vanilla extract  smirnoff whipped vodka  jim beam black  and surprisingly  jim beam red stag  were also among my favorites  even though i like some of the harsh bourbons in cola they made terrible vanilla extract  as did they very cheap harsh vodkas that seem to be recommended  i only tried 2 types of rum   neither were among my favorites also  i let some other batches set for 3 months and they were better than the 2 months ones good beans for the price  lousy directions  directions leave much to be desired ,1,0
5231,this product does have a nice flavor  however  it is somewhat more granular than regular splenda  also  i don t think that i would use it for baking purposes overall   not bad though  not a bad alternative sweetener,1,0
5228,this item should of been rated a 5 star instead of 1   hit the wrong button   i received it in a timely matter and in good condition   would like to be set up on a auto pay if it is available   thanks you and sorry for the star issue  ringer,1,0
5227,at 9 1  abv  this is one of the heaviest oktoberfest beers available   it has a nice copper hue  a noticable hoppiness  and a lingering head   it s a decent beer   however  in my humble opinion  it s a little bit heavy for an autumnal lager   not bad though   this lager is listed as an avery  dictator series  beer    i ve taken the marketing bait  i m going to be on the lookout for the other gimmick beers in this series  a very potent oktoberfest lager   3 5 stars,1,0
5226,a friend brought some of these over   i love them  normally with mints i tend to be wary because most mints have no flavor   the mint it way too strong  but these arent like that at all  they are sweet but not overly so    you can actually taste flavor because the mint isnt beyond strong  i really like these  would recommend these    will buy these in the future     not too sweet or bitter    the mint isnt too strong or weak either  a great candy ,1,0

5223,the cultivator is light yet very effectiven in covering the seeds sown on unprepared soil   it is strongly built although it may sometimes feel incapable of handling areas consisting of an abundance of small stones   the tines are very sharp and are not easily damaged by stones   i owned another brand before which fell apart after a few uses  that seemed to be the result of the soft metal from which it was made and the tendency to jam during use for no apparent reason   i recommend this cultivater to anyone who likes gardening and is not very strong  the price was right and the cultivator really does a good job    thanks to amazon   otto gillings black  decker bd1769 roary garden cultivator  ,1,0
5222,they are not the plastic packages  ps  kinda wasteful  but then good for on the go  they do taste good though  they are styrafoam cups,1,0
5221,really  really good coffee   a bold flavor with that touch of nuttiness that i prefer   we compost and was hoping for something totally compostable that could simply be thrown in the bin  this is much preferable to the old k cups but still the plastic top remains for the trash   i see no reason why a fully compostable product could not be developed  excellent coffee   ,1,0
5229,i saw a review that one of the other customers wrote about china  i didn t quite understand what they were trying to say about these oysters  they are very good though  they re really good sized  you only need one per cracker  unless you re greedy lol  i really appreciate the bigger size oysters  one time i bought some oysters  i forgot what brand they were but they were so tiny i had to balance a few of them on one cracker which pretty much pissed me off but these are great  you won t be disappointed at all  awesome  ,1,0
5263,i just received my order   was suppose to be 4 17 oz bottles   i received4 9 oz bottles    well packed  but only 9 oz   not a very good price forthat amount  i would like to apologize   i did look at the bottles size wrong do like the product and would give it 5 stars i did get  17 oz bottles,1,0
5241,i have had my keurig about 2 weeks now and was kind of feeling these must just make weak coffee until i tried this stuff i have 40 cups or so of tullys french roast bold to get rid of now  wouldnt waste bottled water on those again after trying the jet fuel  best i have tried,1,0
5243,but  i have tried some other teas to find something to replace that awful lipton junk that i have been using for my iced tea for years  what i do know is that it has great flavor in iced tea  better than anything else i have tried  although i haven t tried any of the other davidson teas   tastes like dirt  that reviewer needs a taste bud tune up  i am not a tea snob,1,0
5261,i have tried many erin baker cookies and have not been dissapointed i m glad they created this variety box with two flavors and wish they would make more combinations maybe even 3 in one box all the cookies are on the heavy side compared to normal cookies as they are made with whole grains but the flavors are still good as the whole grains do not kill the taste as in some whole grain bakery items i have had before it seems erin has taken some time to figure out the correct combination of healthy ingredients and good taste  erin makes some good cookies,1,0
5260,that s right  i bought the product for my cats  not only does it taste the same  look the same  but also smell the same  for some reason  it costs a fraction of the pet version  i guess that says it all  except for the fact that my pusses go nuts over a very healthy treat  ask my pussy cats,1,0
5259,this freeze dried ice cream is great  it tastes exactly like the more expensive kind with the astronaut on the package  for a fraction of the price  after receiving this  i understand why it costs less than the  astronaut  kind  the packaging stinks on ice normally  freeze dried items are packaged in air tight  foil type packages  so as to not permit light  and most importantly  air into the package  air is the enemy of freeze dried items  because it contains moisture  the product arrives it is in an air tight can  which you need to open with a can opener  inside  the individual servings of ice cream are in paper wrappers that will not keep air out of the product it gets worse  the paper wrappers are not only not air tight  but they are also all slit open  every serving is slit open in several places  the can says to transfer the servings into a ziplock bag and get as much air out as possible  this may or may not keep the product fresh  but doing so is better than leaving the ice cream in the can with mine  i got as much air out of the bag as i could  by closing the bag as much as possible around a straw  i then sucked the air out until i could get no more air out  then slipped the straw out  whilst closing the bag in one swift motion  you must do this every time you open the bag to retrieve a serving  or air will ruin the delightful texture of the ice cream  so be prepared with large ziplock bags and a straw if you order this product  great product  poor packaging ,1,0
5258, not bad   not exactly what you might think of as a ringing endorsement  but it is the drink contains a good amount of protein and the taste is as good as any protein drink around be careful to gently shake  as instructed the drink before opening  not vigorously shake or it will blow up on your hands when opening the price point is very competitive  not bad,1,0

5242,i order these raisins regularly  i didn t like that they had sunflower oil in them  but since the bulk organic raisins at my local health food store also contained the oil and were more expensive  i kept ordering these made in nature raisins from amazon  because they are the cheapest organic raisins i have been able to find  the raisins in the last order i got tasted terrible   all three bags   and i didn t think i d order them again  because while they re the cheapest organic raisins i ve found  they aren t cheap at almost  8 a bag  fortunately i gave them one last try because i hadn t found an affordable alternative yet  i just received my order today  i noticed right away that the packaging design had been changed slightly  so i looked closer to see if anything else was different  great news  for those of you who also weren t happy about the added oil  the raisins i received today only have one ingredient   organic seedless raisins  they taste much better than they did when they had the added oil  and are less clumpy  too  the raisins in the last order i got were horribly clumpy   i hope this is a permanent change  no more sunflower oil ,1,0
5254,my 5 month old is teething and putting everything in her mouth  she is simultaneously showing interest in food  i was looking for something that would satisfy all of her needs and this is it  although this is made in china  i felt confident about buying it because it is organic  the crackers are crisp and textured so they provide teething relief  however once they get really wet they dissolve  so there s no choking risk  this plus is also a minus because if your baby is messy and gets this everywhere  clean up before they dry because they dry like cement chips  just what i was looking for ,1,0

5249,i got the sampler pack  and was  in general  very happy with the coffees  i generally prefer my coffee on the intense side  no  not burnt  but with a lot of flavor   so i found the corner donut shop to be too mild for my taste  but cyclone was much more in line with my preferences the coffee was all really fresh for a k cup  i found the ones marked extra bold to have the right amount of taste  while the regulars were passable now that i ve sampled the variety  i m ready to move on to the specific blends that match my palate  good quality,1,0

5244,these are for the person who wants to like gummy bears but just never could the  gummy  taste of normal gummy bears is offset by the foamy undercandy   it makes for a very nice taste that s not too harsh   additionally  for me personally  i like them because they don t stick in my teeth like normal gummies    tip  let them sit out for a few days   they ll start to get a little tougher to chew   somehow  it helps the flavor  i know the bag is huge  but gummy candy doesn t go stale quickly  so it ll last   and you can give some away if you don t want them all   still worth it  delicious,1,0

5310,best olive oil you can get   i ve missed it since i came back to the states   you will find no better flavor   it is  frutatto  or  fruited   so it has  a very robust flavor in addition to being unfiltered  if ya don t like the  sediment  stick to filtered types    i would say that anyone who rates this below 4 stars lacks educated taste buds when it comes to these things   olive oil you buy in chain grocery stores are not even in the same  class as this  if you like grocery store stuff with italian sounding names  best stick to that  but if you are  an olive oil snob like me  you won t be  disappointed  l optimo  the best ,1,0
5313,i m not sure why this is called woman s energy  maybe it revs up some women  but for me  it s the exact opposite  and i get drowsy and sleepy  but it s a  peaceful  easy feeling   it does contain chamomile  the taste  well  it s an herbal tea  and most of them taste like grass to me  but with a dollop of almond milk and a little agave nectar  it s quite drinkable  i m post menopausal  and i m trying to get my hrt on a moon phase schedule  so i plan to begin drinking this only on the 4th week of my cycle to see if it will help balance my hormones  which have been a mess since my surgery nearly 20 years ago  even with compounded bio identical hormone cream  i would recommend this tea but not for an energy boost  i like the way it makes me feel,1,0
5375,i initially purchased a package of this brownie mix from walmart  it was on clearance  for years  i had no idea why i was always sick  one of the outstanding food problems was chocolate  consequently  i did not eat it  i was not sad  but every now and again i would want to have a bite of it  it couldn t be too chocolately  it had to be more on the lines of a milk chocolate flavor  anyway  i made these brownies tonight  since i like cake like brownies  not such a concentrated chocolate flavor   i made some changes  i did not use the recipe on the package  in place of the listed 1 2 cup of water  i used 1 2 cup of milk  i also added 1 4 cup of water  i like cooked pecans  so i added slightly chopped pecans in the batter and some whole pecans on top  the result was really good brownies  i like the melted chunks of chocolate in brownies  my brownies were no where close to gritty  this may be due to the fact that i used milk  lactose free  in place of the main water ingredient  will buy again and use for events  it won t even be necessary to tell others it is gluten free until after they ve said how good they are   smile  suprisingly good,1,0

5371,i don t mean that the product is bad  because it s not  cheez it s are always a good snack to munch on  and amazon doesn t deliverer them old or anything  what i mean is the price  it varies from time to time  so it s hard to  subscribe  to the item  one day it s  8 the other day is  12 the next day is  16  it never stays the same either way  i m not giving the product a bad review  just letting you guys know that if the product is more than  8  then wait for it to get back to  8 before purchasing  it s great  but sometime s not ,1,0
5370,it just didn t sound like that many  but it s a bunch  you won t be buying coffee filters for another 6 5 years     assuming 1 pot of coffee a day    turns out the coffee pot we got doesn t really need filters  and the water backs up a bit with a filter being used   still  it does what it says  and its a good bargain for the volume  2400 pots of coffee,1,0

5362,i have a moderate camel cricket infestation in my basement and detached garage  i purchased a set of these traps for use in the basement initially and was flabbergasted at the rate at which i trapped those little buggers  durring the first week that i had the traps down  i must have replaced all of them at least once because they were completely filled  the crickets must have crawled across other crickets to reach the sticky areas in the back corners of the trap  after my success in the basement  i put a few in the garage and caught so much the traps were significantly heavier  highly recommend this product for medium to large size bugs  it failed to trap tiny spiders as i figure they are just too small to sink into the adhesive  perfect for basement camel crickets,1,0
5361,hard to rate dog food if you don t eat it   my dog loves these and i actually use these as treats rather than food   saves me lots of money over those expensive dog treats   the texture feels like ground beef    and it doesn t smell too bad   i wish the bag was resealable  my dog loves these,1,0

5359,i posted this review about the aroy d 100  pure coconut cream  33 8 oz package  3 pack  also   but i ordered this first  as i wasn t sure if it would work for me i am on a diet that requires me to temporarily be dairy free and needed something for my coffee   but i didn t want canned coconut milk  as i understand that the bpa free cans contain bps  which is nearly as nasty   i wanted something in aseptic packages when i first used it in coffee  it did taste slightly coconut like  but not in an overwhelming way   i am someone who can t use virgin coconut oil cause it s too strong  i get expeller pressed   but this did not taste like too much coconut for use as a healthy coffee creamer the package says to refrigerate after opening and to use within 2 days   i do neither of these and it remains quite yummy   edible i have also used it in a few recipes calling for coconut milk just by diluting half way with water but my new favorite is adding a tablespoon or two of this to a mug of homemade chicken broth and a bit of sea salt   this is incredibly yummy  great for coffee,1,0

5396,hey all this is probably the best espresso to come out of a tassimo  that being said  no t disk is worth more than 60 cents a pop  so this is overpriced  when you review an item and give it 1 star  you are rating the product as bad and it gives the wrong impression when you are simply upset about being ripped off  i agree with you though  this is currently outrageously overpriced considering i was getting three packs for something like 50 cents per serving  coffe good  seller bad,1,0
5395,my coworker who has a scottish fiancee was reading a reddit thread where people were posting their favorite national products of their home country    the scots overwhelmingly chose irn bru  my coworker said that he had tried it while visiting scotland and it was the most vile soda on earth  with a taste out of hell  a sickening combination of burning hatred and battery acid  i was intrigued and ordered this six pack the next minute  eventus stultorum magister right     when these showed up  there was a note on the label that exhorted the soon to be quaffer to chill the drink before consumption  which i took seriously as i prepared to drink my liquid hate  finally the time came   i grasped the bottle  wincingly angled it back and    it was pretty good  sweet  a bit citrus y  a bit bubble gummy    in fact  it tastes just like an orange colored mitsuya cider if you know japanese sodas   or maybe a chilsung cider if you know korean ones  my coworker is a total liar  i gave him one of bottles from this six pack and he conceded that it wasn t horrible in the slightest  i don t know what practical joke his future in laws played on him when he was in scotland  because he sure wasn t drinking this irn bru  not awful at all,1,0
5394,this is a breakfast blend coffee and  for many coffee producers  a breakfast blend also means  the strongest daggone brew we can make  mentality   well  caffeine is caffeine and this guy is a bit strong for me   i prefer caribou s breakfast blend over this green mountain version  it s just entirely more smooth  no bitterness at all  and just a very enjoyable cup of coffee   i think this one tastes a bit burnt  like starbuck s  not at all as nice as some of their other blends  especially the pumpkin spice   awesome     try it to see if it suits your taste but get the 12 pack first   otherwise  if you think the way i do  24 of these guys is a lot of coffee to wash down  not the best  but certainly  not the worst ,1,0

5392,it is not a random thing lindt is one of the finest chocolates in the world  after all mr  lindt and mr  sprungli practically invented the chocolate business  it s a real shame  because alcohol regulations by each u s  state  these liquor filled bars are not available on your local grocery store and or even with lindt usa since they don t import em  but now thanks to some importers we are able to enjoy em  please  pay attention  if you buy them  you really will enjoy em  these liquor filled bars have the real liquor inside  they are not stuffed or truffled like some other good brands like goldkenn which happen to have liquor truffled chocolates  with lindt you will have the real deal inside and that is why these chocolates  according to my lindtusa inquiry  won t be available anytime soon as a retail item since each state has their own regulation for liquor filled products  meaning that maybe the irish coffee  7  alc  is ok in california but not in philadelphia  all that being said  just buy them through these amazon vendors and you will be golden  i placed my order and i received my bars in pristine order just after 5 days and just paying regular s h  again   you won t regret    excellence by lindt,1,0
5389,this product came on time   it was a large quantity of candy   the colors were not as bright as the picture but there was no denying it was lego candy   i made 35 little bags out of the 2lb package   i got the bags from a craft store and tied them with lego colored ribbon   i don t think you would want a child eating more than the 2 oz in one sitting   it is hard candy that is clearly all sugar   you could build with the candy which was cool   i did have a peanut allergy at the party and the mom said she checked it on line and he was able to eat it   which he did with no problems  exactly what i thought it would be,1,0

5382,to be perfectly honest  i was scared to death to give these noodles a try   with all the negative comments  i was sure i d wasted my money   first of all  everyone talked about the fishy stinky smell when opening the package   i didn t smell a thing   i neither avoided or stuck my nose in the package   i simply opened the pack  dumped in a strainer and rinsed   no big deal i got my water boiling and put them in the water long enough to heat   i drained and added a little olive oil to keep them from sticking together   i put marinara sauce on them and added my meatballs   i then topped it off with grated parmesan cheese   i m looking forward to stir fry next   i honestly don t know what all the fuss is about  i m one of the pickiest people i know when it comes to how my food taste these noodles are thin  white clear in color   i tasted one plain  it doesn t have a negative taste but bland and will absorb the flavors of what you re cooking with   i have no idea why people say they look like worms   they are the typical asian noodle you would find in asian oriental cooking if you have missed having high carb noodles you should give these a try   if you are a die hard wheat spagetti person  then maybe these won t satisfy your craving for spagetti and meatballs   i m going to rate them a 5 because i know they will be even better in the oriental dishes i ve been missing  positive review,1,0

5355,it s difficult to review a product when you d like to praise the actual product but have objections to some aspect of amazon s sale of it  one perennial problem with subscribe and save grocery items is that you have no way of knowing what the item s expiration date is  in this instance  i ordered a case of lemon burst  package of 12  and anticipated that i would have enough for 9 months to a year  this is a potent product and you need to add only a small amount to produce a strong and vital lemon flavor  unless you re making food for a restaurant  it s hard to imagine that anyone would use enough of this product to use up a pack of 12 in less time than that  if i m wrong about this  and you re one of those who do use enormous amounts of lemon flavoring  this part of the review will not apply to you  for the rest of you  here is my experience  i ordered the package of 12 in mid may of 2012  the expiration date on the individual containers is mid october 2012  giving me less than 6 months in which to use up the 12 containers  if i d known this  i would not have ordered  since i couldn t possibly use that amount in less than six months  i ve had the same issue on occasion  and seen it commented on by others  with grocery items in bulk  such as mayonnaise  where the product was close to the expiration date when it arrived  i suppose there are people who could use six large jars of mayo in a month or so  but if you are not one of them  beware ordering time sensitive products through subscribe and save  in any event  the vendor should be required to state the expiration date so that the buyer has the needed information to decide for himself or herself whether to order i ve used this product for some time  long before i bought it from amazon  and have used it in everything where you might possibly use lemon juice  including a squirt in iced tea   it s pure lemon juice and oil of lemon  unadulterated in any way  and has a potent true lemon flavor  i believe i ve tried every such product on the market  and this is by far the best  it exists in an entirely different universe from  real lemon  nor should it be confused with supermarket lemon juices that come in a similar container but bear no resemblance whatsoever to this pure and natural product  if you re uncertain about buying large quantities of a product you may not have tried before  this item is usually easily found in health food stores and co ops  where you can buy a single one and give it a try  as there are also some reports of allergic reactions to lemon juice due to factors that might not be disclosed on this site  it s always good to look at the actual ingredient list printed on the product  good product but avoid subscribe and save,1,0
5333,assuming that these bags truly are easier on the environment than store bought bags  i would rate them as a success   but that is assuming    i ve been using them for over a year now  not for composting  but just for household wastebaskets   no  they are not as tough as store bought bags  but i didn t expect them to be   they are indeed lightweight   they will not withstand shards of broken glass  nor will store bought bags  or other sharp objects  but they have proven more than adequate for ordinary household use this type of product  however imperfect  seems to represent a positive step forward   assuming     waited a while before reviewing,1,0

5325,first off  i ordered this product last week and the price for a set of 6 phones was somewhere in the  7  8 range  not the  18 price i see today   my review is based on the lower price   i was very happy with the product   you should be aware that each set of 6 comes in a combination of colors   in my package there were 2 pink phones  2 blue phones  and 2 silver phones   as i was giving these away at a child s spy birthday party with both boys and girls in attendance that worked for me   i was quite surprised that for the price these phones were a decent size  opened and had working keys that actually played different sounds like beeps and music  depending on which key pressed    all of the phones were in working condition   the candy is small multi colored balls that are a bit like hard sweet tarts   the kids were thrilled to receive them and i was happy with the item   i didn t have any problems with non working phones and i had ordered 24 of them  five stars at the price i paid,1,0

5322,if you re eating these  it probably isn t because you are looking for the most flavorful  best on tooth noodle you can find you are eating these because you are interested in low calorie or extremely high fiber food products we ordered these from amazon and the first time we tried them  they were    weird  we d made an oily sauce with garlic and ginger and it pretty much wouldn t come near the noodles  the noodles absorbed none of the sauce  they sat in different sides of the bowl and we were left with eating alien  rubbery  flavorless  weirdness in a bowl of oil  not recommended the second time we prepared them  each bag is really one small serving  i beta tested a few noodles with my sauce before making the whole batch of noodles to make sure we didn t have the same experience again  a simple tomato   red sauce worked really well  classico brand sauce with additional garlic  salt  and veggies the main annoyance is that they cling together and clump in weird ways  but it s only so bad and seems like it might be a trick i could get better at managing i would give these 2 3 stars if i were comparing them to pasta  there is a slightly odd not quite fishy smell  rinse well before using but  for zero calorie  high fiber  alien noodle weirdness  these are pretty great  weird  alien  edible  pretty good,1,0
5321,i have 2 cats  one male and one female   the male is crazy about these   i just discovered that he got the bag  ripped it open and ate them all   i had started with a small bag to be sure at least one of them liked them  so not too bad a loss  the female just sniffed and walked away  but she is not crazy about fish flavored treats anyway   i just reordered a big bag of the poultry flavored ones   i am sure the male will like them and i hope the female goes for these as her teeth are the worst of the 2 of them  one of my cats loves them,1,0
5319,these toast up very nicely   the dough is crisped  the the filling is nicely warmed   they do not leak in the toaster  either   really like that they are not frosted   these are so hard to find in a grocery store   check the expiration date  though   all ours will expire in december 2012   we have had to eat these quicker than i planned  really taste like blueberry,1,0
5318,this is a great little product   i think anything associated w kurig is over priced  but as long as the little hinge holds up  i ll give it 4 stars   i like buying my fresh beans to grind myself   i like being able to adjust my strength of brew myself by controlling how much i use of my own grind   and i really like not having all those expensive little plastic cups filling my trash can  nothing but my own grind for now on ,1,0

5316,five stars because it is a numi product  and all ingredients are top notch as usual   it s like drinking a cup of fresh roses  pretty awesome if that s your thing   i bought two boxes and am regretting it because this tea really doesn t do it for me at all  where as i thought it would   i suggest trying a box before going crazy like i did   still  it s a high end tea and delivers as advertised  didn t really do it for me,1,0
5324,well i gave this product 4 stars because the purpose i used it for was not intended   i saw that it had 95   meat which was perfect  in my mind  for a cat diet  and the price point was nearly half of that which is for cats ftr   cats and dogs have two completely and vastly varied nutritional needs  in my research i recall reading that a cat s diet is mainly 95  meat  from which they derive their moisture water from as well  since cats hunt and eat small rodents and birds in nature this makes sense  since the 5  veggie content is likely from eating cat grasses and the contents of their prey s tummy at the time of death i decided to purchase this food since it was only 2 56 a can at unleashed and i figured i would just add in a calcium supplement  and taurine  and cat vitamin supplement to make up for the missing bones which would provide the natural calcium source for cats  and taurine since i don t believe dogs require as much taurine in their diets as cats would and vitamins to make up for the possibility that there may not be enough vitamins in just meat alone my cats loved it   i have one very finicky girl kitty whom refuses to eat human foods  which is a good thing   and most junky cat foods  another good thing   and one male cat that eats whatever he can get his whiskers into   they both liked this   so i would consider feeding this to them in lieu of the more expensive cat foods  after i compare the ingredients of this to that of cat foods and make up the missing vitamins and minerals   however i am not happy with the fact that this cat food has the consistency of pate  it is all ground up meats and looks like refried beans    i m going to search for a similar product which has shredded meat rather than this consistency    looks like pate meh   1 star,1,0
5356,love these treats for my puppy and my veterinarian was pleased with this product since the pup is slightly overweight and made in the usa  unfortunately they are quite pricey   but when i started on the automatic monthly shipments from amazon at the reduced price  amazon cancelled the automatic shipments before the first shipment  for whatever reason  so now i have to buy them at the full higher price   i guess someone wanted more money so i will have to either buy them less frequently or find somewhere else to get them at a better price or look for something else   how sad for my puppy  she really  really enjoys these treats  great item  disappointing price   shipping service from amazon,1,0
5335,   it would not dissolve fully   product from local grocery dissolved fine  but what i bought from amazon left chunks of product in the iced tea   very strange   but do buy this product somewhere   no glycemic index  no carbs  no calories   splenda and even other stevia products can t match those stats   cheers  love this product  but   ,1,0
5337,there s no true middle ground as far as these go  i ve passed these around to others and have found that you either adore this new flavor or it s something that you just want to avoid like the plague in true tic tac fashion  there s a hint of mint here in order to try to give lip service to the idea that this product was originally supposed to freshen your breath  or at least some version of the brand are  this didn t detract from my overall enjoyment of the candy  although it does sort of give you a little pause when you first eat them  as far as the strawberry flavor goes  this is as far from a real strawberry flavor as you can get while still tasting decent  if you re hoping for anything other than an artificial flavor that resembles something berry ish  then you might want to stick to the other flavors of tic tac  this is strawberry enough to recognize it  but i can t help but think that if i were to have this placed into a pile of other flavors  i might not be able to immediately identify it as such  i do like these  but i want to really stress that if you re looking for strawberry strawberry flavor rather than the candy companies  interpretation of strawberry over the years  you ll be disappointed overall though  i liked this enough to buy it again several times  that there s a cute nod to the beatles via the name is nice and will no doubt pull several people in to purchase them  you ll either love them or hate them,1,0

5353,i tried a one pack first coconut cream   100  pure  having decided i like it  i switched to this i am on a diet that requires me to temporarily be dairy free and needed something for my coffee   but i didn t want canned coconut milk  as i understand that the bpa free cans contain bps  which is nearly as nasty   i wanted something in aseptic packages when i first used it in coffee  it did taste slightly coconut like  but not in an overwhelming way   i am someone who can t use virgin coconut oil cause it s too strong  i get expeller pressed   but this did not taste like too much coconut for use as a healthy coffee creamer the package says to refrigerate after opening and to use within 2 days   i do neither of these and it remains quite yummy   edible i have also used it in a few recipes calling for coconut milk just by diluting half way with water but my new favorite is adding a tablespoon or two of this to a mug of homemade chicken broth and a bit of sea salt   this is incredibly yummy  great for coffee,1,0
5352,i tried a stevia product years ago  it was expensive and my goodness was it disgusting  bitter with the most terrible taste  the box is still lurking around somewhere in the pantry  it made me wonder for so long why people are raving about stevia when it is so unbearable  i stuck to liquid splenda after that  so i was at the grocery store recently and decided i will give stevia another shot     pyure got it right     is all i have to say  it s sweet and that s it   no bitterness  no strange flavor  no gargling with mouthwash  tried a stevia product before  just put pyure in my cereal  i m smilin  ,1,0

5350,the similac bottled formula is what you will find in my emergency car kit  i breastfeed at home and on the go but a situation arose that i was not able to nurse our son henry  we were stuck in traffic and were nowhere near an exit  thankfully this was in the eck and i was able to open one up  place a disposable nipple and feed the hungry baby  the formula when sealed after the first use can be stored for a few hours in the refrigerator or cooler  this formula did not have an awkward foul odor or color  the option to be able to use inexpensive disposable nipples is wonderful to sum it up  this product does what it intends to do  provide a sterile  simply  and convenient method of feeding baby on the go  emergency car kit must have   ,1,0
5349,i know there are arguments for and against but i feel dry food is a  space age  relic that was good for pet food companies  but not necessarily for pets   cats in particular require foods with a high moisture content that dry food lacks   that doesn t leave canned pet food marketers in the clear either as your definition of acceptable ingredients probably does not include many of the ingredients the fda and aafco considers safe    google the list  it ll be worth it  my cat normally gets a variety of wellness and blue buffalo wilderness canned foods   these are generally considered premium foods but i m always on the lookout for other ways to add variety to her diet   what i like most about this food is they clearly state the food contains 95  meat   that is a huge plus that no other pet food i am aware of matches   i realize other pet foods will list a meat as the first ingredient  but if the second  third  and fourth ingredients are starches  grains  or vegetables you could end up with food that is less than 50  meat even if it s the first ingredient on the list   humans are omnivores  dogs are to some extent  but cats must have meat and bones to survive so many advertised cat food brands contain mostly unhealthy high carbohydrate ingredients like corn  wheat and so on as primary ingredients that it makes me mad   you don t see your housecat in the garden pouncing on a wild ear of corn or a potato  do you   these items should have never made their way into cat foods in the first place   that is why i am very happy to see a pet food that actually lists a high percentage of meat content on the label   as you can expect  it tends to be more expensive  almost twice as much as cheap brands   consider this  however   when i opened my eyes to what i was really feeding my pet and switched  my cat ate half as much as the brand name junk   it seems once you start feeding your pet real digestible food  they don t need to eat as much of it of course the real critic of this food is my cat   i am happy to report that not only does she like this food but my normally quiet and reserved cat will meow her desire if she catches a whiff of what s inside the can   since she rarely meows for anything  that s quite a compliment   i will be purchasing more of this in the future  fantastic cat food   my picky cat loves it ,1,0

5344,the negative reviews for celestial seasonings bengal spice tea are from people who were expecting chai  this company does imply this is their version of chai  but not that it is suppose to be chai    it is not a decaf version of chai    if it was  it would say that and i m sure the taste would be different  this is a spice tea  that is decaf  that s all  upon giving up caffeine  i turned to this to replace my chai tea  and it did not disappoint  it is excellent  but like other reviews good or bad  that is my opinion  my kids love it  and prefer it over hot cocoa when we add a touch of almond milk  needs no sweetening in my opinion and i wouldn t change a thing  again  it is not chai  but it s a great way to replace chai and the caffeine in it  if you re concerned about that although cinnamon is the predominant flavor  i have to beg to differ on the thought that it taste like big red or red hot candy boiled in water    not so  the taste is lovely when combined with the other flavors  i suppose you would need to taste it to form your own opinion  to us  it s fantastic  would recommend and would order again and again  better than chai,1,0
5343,the venus flytraps come in a little plastic baggy with a wet tissue wrapped around it at the roots so that it doesn t dry out  it also comes with some moss and instructions on how to set up the venus flytraps as stated  when i received mine  two of my traps were already partially black and i could not recover them back  but like the others have said  i received 4 instead of 3 traps so it made up for it  mine didn t really last that long  but it s probably because i didn t transplant it correctly  i think it d help if the instructions were also a bit more clear on how to transplant it correctly and maybe possibly even pictures  in any case  the things listed within the description most definitely came within the package  good service too as he emails you again to make sure everything is okay   it was a little too late for me though  hmmm   ,1,0

5346,i was terribly upset when the mccormick s potato steamers products were no longer available at my supermarket  i found this product on amazon and decided to give it a try  i actually prepared it just the way i did the steamers   with the help of a microwave steamer bag  i coated the chopped up potatoes in 1 tablespoon of oil  then added the seasoning packet  squishing it around to coat all of the potatoes and steamed it for 7 or 8 minutes it was delicious  in fact  my husband liked it better than the steamer product b c the seasoning was a little more subdued  for those who lament the loss of potato steamers,1,0

5217,a friend brought some of these over   i love them  normally with mints i tend to be wary because most mints have no flavor   the mint it way too strong  but these arent like that at all  they are sweet but not overly so    you can actually taste flavor because the mint isnt beyond strong  i really like these  would recommend these    will buy these in the future     not too sweet or bitter    the mint isnt too strong or weak either  a great candy ,1,0
5214,i was really happy when i found this deal on amazon   great price for my cheerios   however  i did see the note about the packaging may contain more and different information    i figured how bad can that be   when i opened my first box this morning  the first thing i noticed was the package inside was short  i didn t care too much until i poured the cheerios into the bowl   when i stopped pouring and stood the box back up a bunch of cheerios slid down the inside of the box between the packing and the box so to avoid wasting some cheerios each morning i ll need to tell everyone in the family to lift the bag up above the box top before you pour your cereal in the morning  which probably won t happen much  the bottom line is these are so cheep because they are factory rejects   the interior or exterior packaging may not be up to standard   i would hope that they would all  at least  be sealed  but i m sure you could get a little more or a little less cereal than what s printed on the box  hence the disclaimer on the page  so as long as you understand what your signing up for then this is a great deal   my cheerios tasted real good  product good packaging may not be ,1,0
5081,my cats aren t very fond of the taste  it took forever to get them to switch to this food  when i give them this  they leave it in the bowl and pick at it all day  if i give them their old food  they ll eat all of it within half an hour  perhaps that s better  and will help keep their weight down  i did not notice a difference in their coat or the smell of their litter box  there was two or three weeks of vomiting before fully switching over though  which was gross to say the least  i have found that my cats eat much much less than the recommended amount on the bag took one star off because they only tolerate it  they don t like it  but they eat it,1,0
5080,i hated stevia and it s licorice taste until i tried nustevia   since that day  i have almost completely eliminated sugar in my drinks   i like that it is a plant based product and not bio engineered   no after taste and you need very little to make anything taste sweet  nunaturals nustevia is great,1,0

5076,while everyone can have their opinion  the scientific justification and logic in some of the arguments are without reason or merit it is not monkfruit  it s a sweetening product which has monkfruit   comparing it to stevia the herb is not plausable   apples to apples 150 times sweeter than sugar is not the same as 150  sweeter than sugar   150  is 1 5 times sweeter than sugar   while this is a common mistake  like your vs you re  this should not be a mistake when doing an analysis or making an argument the total calories is unknown and not calculable   the listed 1 gm and  lt 1grm when it s itemized means it is non zero   in fact 1 gram of sugars from erythritol is 0 2 kcals so if there is 0 1 grams  that s it s only 2 one hundredths of a single calorie  2 100th    calories is non zero and less than 5 but any other attempt at calculating the calories without knowing the exact contribution between  0  lt  x  lt  1gm of each ingredient is guessing comparing a teaspoon of this to a teaspoon of sugar as an argument that it has significant calories makes no sense   a serving of this is 1 4 of a teaspoon   what s the point of using super sweet items if you do arguments based on volume the added ingredients are there for volume and texture   for the mass market  an eye dropper and instructions to attempt to get out 1   150th of a drop in my grandma s tea isn t a viable product model   even getting out 1 4 of a teaspoon is rather hard   ingredients are listed by weight  by law  they aren t listing it by the   sweetness the amount adds to the total product   you are paying for a certain amount of  sweetness   a k a  a  serving    would there be less issues if there were no fillers and you get 120 servings of sweetener but it comes in the size of a single sugar packet   get out the micro scale and the razor blades is it natural   let s look 1  erythrytol   created from fermented sugar   is vodka and whiskey natural 2  sugar   even if it s gm  genetically modified  beet sugar  it s the  granulated white stuff  95  of american s call table sugar   most foods at the typical grocery store are gm   even the farmer s market   who do you think they buy their seeds from   monsanto 3  monk fruit   seems like there are no arguments on this being  natural  4  molasses   by product of making table sugar  that white stuff people see on the tables and make cookies with calories will add up and increase your blood sugar   only if you consume a lot   all at once   last i knew  people didn t sit down and eat 140 sugar packets at once   even then  you are looking at less of an impact on your blood sugar than 1 4th of a candy bar   half of those few calories is from erythrytol  which according to wikipedia does not have any affect on the blood sugar level pure erythrytol is close to the same cost per  1 serving of sugar like sweetness  as this   you just need a lot more of it it s a lot of nit picking and there s a lot more i could go over but people seem vocal over trivial things   does it really matter if something has 1 calorie when the whole point is that people are consuming way too much sugar and fat in their diet   why focus on getting  no fat  if the purpose is to cut calories and get to a reasonable diet   we as a country are too obsessed on going from extreme to extreme   i see people 300 pounds over weight screaming at the barista about getting the non fat milk over the 2  or the diet coke to their 3 platter long john silver s meal lastly as a sweetening product  i like it   it s has a slight fruity taste   cooking i have no idea but i like it in my morning coffee and tea   i use to use 1 2 spenda packet 1 2 sugar packet but i ve replaced it with a pinch of this   i m going to try it in my rib marinade and see how it works i suggest anyone thinking about it  you can get free samples from the company  try it   you won t die from it  look at a single slice of white bread and compare it  there is a lot of incorrect information in other reviews,1,0
5074,i have suffered from severe cramping while running long distances   nothing i tried would help   i have not cramped once since using this product   when mixed with gatorade or powerade it s not too overpowering   you will sweat out a lot of salt but that s to be expected   if you have cramping problems due to being a salty sweater this product will work  nothing works better,1,0
5073,bottom line absolute kickbutt value for your money  very authentic and spicy enough where spice lovers will nod their heads and smile   for those who avoid spice and salt  use lots of yogurt or powdered milk and also you can add cheese like queso blanco or queso fresco  if you don t mind it crumbly  if you don t have paneer   i didn t use any butter as i felt there was no need to review so i bought a gigantic bag of royal basmati rice and wanted something to eat with it   i saw the rave reviews for this curry and yet had soso expectations   i live very close to an excellent punjab  restaurant and live with someone who cooks some of the best curries ever   the only reason why i d eat this is if it s decent and it can help me make great curries   therefore when i made it i was surprised this tasted very very good   it can sit comfortably prepared in an indian restaurant and no one would complain timothy b  riley did a excellent suggestion for cooking this properly however also listed ingredients that i need to buy online and don t have readily available in addition i don t have any chicken and a left with gravy that would be very spicy   therefore  for my version  i add about 1 2 cup of skim milk powder mixed with a little bit of water  queso fresco cheese  generous amounts of cumin as well as some kefir yogurt to garnish   i did try adding frozen spinach and it may be too strong for some so cannot recommend as for why queso fresco cheese and not making my own paneer  which is very easy  look for it on food network  i have the very embarrassing habit of eating all the curds when the cheese is straining   i am a bonafide cheese addict and am my own worst enemy when it comes to cheese making   i imagine others may be the same or may simply be too busy so look out for queso fresco or better yet queso blanco in your hispanic markets   otherwise you re forced to be like me and make paneer only when you re very very full  great curry for the price,1,0
5082,i found redbull in the summer of 2012 while working for a small town beverage distributor  every week we would receive six or seven pallets worth of redbull  and without fail one or two cases would have one can cracked  thus making the whole case all soggy  these cases would go into a breakage section of the warehouse  and soon i was taking about three cans a day  technically  i was stealing from my boss  yet i felt no remorse  a clarity washed over me during those months  my hand stayed steady no matter what i was doing and i felt a strong conviction that what i was doing was right  that i was perfectly fulfilling my role as a strong  young man spending his summer in the pacific northwest earlier that spring  i had bought a bunch of stock in the video streaming company netflix  nflx  for about 86 dollars a share  the stock then fell to about 55  a share  and since i bought half my position on margin the company i bought the stock through kept selling off shares to pay for the margin requirements  i assumed my meager net worth was decimated  and i stopped checking the price because it was too painful on my weak  non redbull fueled psyche  then  i randomly decided to check the price in the middle of july  at this point i was approximately one month into my lackadaisical  40 ounces a dayish regimen of redbull consumption  when i checked the price  netflix was trading at 84  a share  just 2  down from where i had bought  i sold the next day for a modest loss  redbull literally saved me from financial ruin  i sincerely believe that the power of redbull so enhanced the powers of my subconscious that i was able to influence every trader from around the world to bid up the price of redbull to its six month high  allowing me to sell at that high  these events all transpired while i was working nine hour shifts in a dimly lit warehouse singing van halen to myself because my damn boss was too damn cheap to buy a goddamn radio  today  netflix is trading at 73  a share  coincidence  there is no such thing as coincidence also  redbull is doing some sort of ad campaign thing called red bull stratos where they are launching a skydiver from about 26 miles up in a special suit  the atmosphere is so thin up there that they expect their skydiver to break the sound barrier  which will be the first time that a human has done that without the help of a jet or motorcycle  nostalgia  memories  glory  this is redbull,1,0

5070,if you have a dog who likes to chew  you need this bone  we have a pitbull who chews for hours on end on this bone  after a year  we are finally replacing it  the shape of the bone is a little    strange    but after a week of chewing you won t notice the shape so much pros  will keep your dog very entertained  cheaper then chewing on furniture or shoes  it lasts a very long time  occupies your dog and gets extra energy out  won t break in half  can be rinsed off if it gets gross the cons  the pieces that are chewed off are small white slivers of plastic  they can get stuck in carpet or rugs and take a few run over s with the vacuum to get them up  after a week of chewing  stepping on the bone is worse then stepping on a lego  your dog needs this,1,0

5068,we love apple granola and try to eat organic where we can    so we did a shootout of trader joe s organic granny s apple granola  nature s path love crunch organic premium granola  and bob s red mill granola  apple cinnamon no fat  12 ounce bags  pack of 4    the three products list their serving size as three different sizes  2 3 cup  1 4 cup  and 1 2 cup   so i normalized the macronutrients and sugars to a 1 2 cup serving for an  apples to apples  comparison trader joes   love crunch   bob s red millcal 180 280 180fat 5 25 12 2 5carb 23 25 44 35sugar 6 75 12 4protein 3 75 4 5the interesting thing is that the trader joe s granola has hands down the best flavor  yet it has the lowest carbohydrate content   trader joe s granola tastes like an explosion of apples   next is the love crunch which has good apple flavor  but not nearly as good as the trader joes    but with nearly twice the carbohydrates and sugar   finally the bob s red mill granola tastes nothing like apples   maybe if i held an apple slice under my nose while i ate it i could taste something    but it really just tastes like slightly sweet granola i do like the fact that love crunch includes chia seeds  but it has lots of other ingredients that i would rather avoid such as  rolled spelt  wheat    soy oil   and rice starch  bob s red mill has the fewest ingredients    if only the taste were on   trader joe s has pretty good ingredients except for the corn syrup solids    a big nono in my book but it is just above salt  45mg of sodium  so it is probably a very small amount in the end we chose the trader joe s as our favorite    the lowest carbohydrate content and low sugars with the exceptional taste being the big draw   after that we chose love crunch    the best on amazon when we can t visit the trader joe s 4 hours away   bob s red mill just doesn t taste anything like apples so we re skipping it   if they made it taste more like apples we would pick it for the limited ingredients and lowest sugars    but seeing as how my wife reaches for the honey when she eats bob s red mill granola    the low sugar is only temporary  best apple granola on amazon,1,0

5099,i purchased this cheese because a recipe called for it and  because i d never heard of it  i did a little research and found many italians won t use anything else for grated cheese of the parmesan romano type  i decided to give it a try and it was wonderful  a full  nutty flavor  so much more robust than any parmesan or romano i d ever had i used it in the recipe i had found  and it was the only cheese in the recipe  the rest of the sauce consisted only of butter and cream  the flavor of the cheese really stood out  i ve only once made a sauce based on parmesan as the sole cheese  and never have again because of the lackluster flavor of the dish  however  locatelli pecorino romano has no such problem i also later purchased another brand of pecorino romano  and  while it was far better than parmesan  it still did not have the wonderful flavor of this cheese the cheese arrived within 24 hours of shipment  very well packed with refrigerant and protective packaging  wonderful cheese  blows parmesan out of the water ,1,0

5094,this is an interestingly tasteful gum  it has just enough sweetness to keep you coming back to it  without being overpowering  it is very flavorful and keeps its taste and chew ability far beyond other gums  even other stride flavors  i went so far as to order two more packs of twelve  as the shipper sent a notice this flavor was being discontinued altogether  if you are looking for a long lasting  tasteful gum  you won t go wrong with stride mega mystery   mega mystery gum,1,0

5090,i ve had these before and loved them   this time i only like them   don t know why this is   maybe manufacturer changed recipe   if so i wish they would go back to the original recipe as i liked them a lot more  sour cream pop chips,1,0
5088,first i have to say i purchased these from a specialist store and not amazon but i will be placing a subscription order for them soon  the product was moist with an almost fruit cake texture which was perfect for me  the flavours where bold and i was excited to tell everyone i know about how good it is  on the downside  the packaging was very deceptive  i know it tells me the weight but when the wrapper is 50  wider and 50  longer than the bar it is really misleading   pamela s  i would expect you to trim some of that waste so i do not feel so stupid and so guilty for the extra wrapper  excellent taste and texture shame about the deceptive packaging,1,0

5096,my wife and i discovered planters spanish redskin peanuts a number of years ago and since that time there was always a place on our kitchen counter where everyone could share this wonderful treat recently the 56 oz can we purchased contained only very light colored peanuts  these were not as well cooked   appeared to have less oil used in the roasting process and therefore the salt normally found evenly distributed mostly migrated to the bottom of the can   worse  a few peanuts were so brittle i first thought they were foreign objects in an effort to find the good formula we purchased three of the 12 5 ounce size and two of the 56 ounce size   unfortunately all were the disappointing new version that we dislike i just concluded a phone call with kraft foods  10 8 12   the parent company of planters   while they did not admit to the product being changed i was told spanish redskin peanuts were discontinued and would soon be out of stock everywhere kraft offered coupons as a good will gesture for all the planters spanish peanuts we re throwing away  but since the old perfect treat is no more  it s a disappointing resolution seldom does a commercially manufactured product like this win over both my wife and i   i must say i m really sad to see it go  especially since the newest  poorly roasted version is not worth stocking up on  five star dropping to one star,1,0
5109,this sweet and sour sauce is a winner because there s no high fructose corn syrup in it   in a world where we have to read labels to make sure we aren t going to die from the food we buy in the grocery store  it is wonderful to know there s a company who cares enough about it s customers to do their homework and not go the cheap way   thank you la choy    la choy sweet   sour sauce   no hfcs   ,1,0
5056,i ordered this product after a friend of my mother s told her about it  my mother s friend uses it because she gets nauseous on a regular basis and ginger  which this product has in spades  helps a lot i have a brain tumor which causes me to experience vertigo  dizziness  and nausea   all on a fairly regular basis  i have medication  ondansetron hcl 8mb to be exact  which works  but gives me an incredible headache as a side effect of making my nausea go away  as a result  i need to take aspirin at the very least  with the medication to offset the side effect  not a pleasant experience to say the least i ve had ginger before as part of juicing  which i do from time to time after watching the movie fat  sick  and nearly dead  available via amazon prime streaming video and hulu   however  i don t have the energy to make juice as often as i would like this tea allows me to get some ginger into my system much easier  the ginger doesn t have the side effects that the aforementioned medication does  so it s my first choice  this tea is way too strong as is though  instead of using a whole packet in a large cup of water  i use a teaspoon  and go from there if i need more ginger to relax my stomach  at least this means that the tea will last much longer if you have chronic nausea for whatever reason  i d give this stuff a try  just beware of the strength and be prepared to adjust the amount you use  unless you want your throat to burn from the high concentration of ginger  strong  but good,1,0
5054,i regularly get the starbucks coffee syrups for my lattes because they are easy to get and have great flavor  i hoped to buy the pumpkin spice syrup from starbucks however they are not sold at any store   so i found this after reading the reviews i was hopeful as one person tried the pumpkin spice and said it was horrible then they tried this one and enjoyed it   i was excited to bring in the fall with a pumpkin latte this morning   however i was surprised  my wife warned me that it was bitter and did not taste good   i didn t believe her and made a latte following the instructions on the bottle which is nice  2 pumps  it suggested 1 5  and i didn t taste much just some bitterness  so i doubled it and put in 4 pumps  it tasted nothing like pumpkin pie that i have made or bought in a store it was bitter and had a spice flavor to it   it also tasted nothing like the starbucks pumpkin latte i have had in the past  i tried drinking it to see if it got better but i could not do it  so i tried the syrup by itself and it was gross  bitter and nothing like pumpkin pie   not sure if i got a bad batch or if this product just is horrible edited update i just got off the phone with amoretti and remade myself a latte with some new information     first the starbucks syrup that i use has 19 grams of sugar in every pump amoretti has 4 grams   this is significant if you have a sweet tooth and if you try to watch the calories   in the 4 pumps of starbucks syrup for my latte i am getting 76 grams of sugar with amoretti i got 16 grams of sugar   if you have a sweet tooth like me that makes a huge difference  second the syrup is more of a syrup than sugar water like starbucks so it is full of flavors   when i put 4 pumps because it wasn t sweet it did make it bitter because i put in way to many spices   so when i remade my latte  total 16 ounces  i put in 2 pumps  1 at first and didn t taste anything so i added another one  with some agave nectar for my sweet tooth   when i tried it there is no bitterness just pumpkin pie flavor that i can taste     so lesson learned read the directions and don t think every syrup is made the same   the amoretti is healthier and full of flavors  to much and it will be bitter  follow the directions around 1 pump for every 8 ounces   amoretti had great customer service when they called and explained the difference in the syrup  i assumed it would be like starbucks and was wrong  right now i am enjoying a pumpkin latte with the amoretti pumpkin syrup   they have a full line of syrups and i look forward to trying the crema di syrups which have a creamer flavor which i like  can t wait for them to arrive  confused,1,0
5029,pros enforced side protectiondon t have to turn the bag upside down to write the info oncons does leak every once in awhilepricieri ve used both honeysuckle and lansinoh bags and i have to say both have leaked on me  however  there was a higher percentage of leaking with the lansinoh bags   the extra side protection on the honeysuckle bags made me feel less worried that it could burst open at any moment   a little pricier than the lansinoh bags  but think of it this way  breast milk is like gold  would you rather pay a cheaper price and end up losing the milk you spent 20 30 minutes pumping because it was leaking out of the bag  great milk storage bags ,1,0
5028,it is not vermont maple syrup   i am originally from upstate ny and grew up withthe vermont maple syrup and i am used to it  this syrup lacks that little tang for lack of a better word  that the vermont syrup has   it does come in second tho  this is a good syrup but   ,1,0

5023,wow  this stuff is off the hook  it arrived in a nano second and was packed so well i was very impressed  i had this at my parents the other day and couldn t resist asking where they got it and when they said amazon  i knew i had to get it for the upcoming chilly days ahead  don t even think about changing your order for this stuff you will not be sorry  i will also reccomend the other sauces that i have purchased which are also scarpetta  vodka sauce is a bsolutely amazzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzing  run don t walk to get yours because it is frequently on backorder and that should tell you something about this product     scarpetta barely bologenese,1,0
5021,i cannot stop eating these things  at first i was a bit underwhelmed by the amount of seasoning on almost all flavors  probably because my point of reference is chili peas that i get locally from big lots which are pretty spicy  i couldn t stop eating these though and they got better with each tasting  i would be ashamed to say how many peas i have eaten in the last 24 hours  i expected to like these  so i ordered all of the flavors and the unexpected standout was bombay curry  it s just so true to the actual flavor  also  there are a lot of peas in these bags  it s a great product  ups screwed up but i m not going to factor that in to this review  somebody please stop me,1,0

5017,i received two jars and gave one to my daughter  now  i don t know what chat should taste like  but this one is strong and peppery tasting  i like the taste  if you don t like that much peppery taste  maybe you would like garam masala  which means  warm mixture    i have to experiment more with this before i can recommend what type of dishes to use it in  ingredients label  salt  dry mango  cumin  musk  melon seeds  musk melon i e  cantalope seeds   coriander  black pepper  pomegranate  ginger  chili  mint  caraway  nutmeg  clove  asafoetida  citric acid  black salt  a lot of spice for the money,1,0
5015,it sat unused in my refrigerator for months until i gave it another chance   i decided every time i got a burrito from chipotle to eat it with this hot sauce   pure torture   but as you become acclimated to the super hotness  it grows on you   now i m trying it on chicken nuggets  still too hot  lol  too hot  but it grows on you   kinda,1,0
5013,i don t normally write reviews  but felt compelled to give another viewpoint based on the poor reviews of these bottles  i exclusively pump and measure my milk accurately  i have had absolutely no inaccuracies in measurement between my breast milk containers and these bottles  and my breast milk collection bags   so i d have to conclude that the measurement on the bottles is accurate  in addition  i ve had absolutely no leaking  with the exception of once when the nipple was not placed in the cap correctly  and none have broken  i have 7 bottles in rotation that have been used for over 3 months  and again  no breakage  i would have to question how some of the bottles that have broken are cared for  they really should not be placed in the dishwasher    especially not on a heated dry cycle  i hand wash my bottles with a bottle brush and hot soapy water  then steam sterilize once a day  we are extremely happy with this product  no issues here,1,0

5010,this is a resubmittal of a previous review   originally  when i received my cheesecake i was very disappointed with the careless way it had been packaged and delivered   and i said so in my review   i now say that if anybody ever says that omaha steakes doesn t care about their product feedback  do not believe it   after submitting my original review  i was contacted by mr  sendgraff of omaha steaks who apologized for their poor packaging and inormed me that omaha steaks has a 100  satisfaction guarantee on all their products and  that he was refunding my entire purchase price  including shipping   even after i told him we had eaten the cheesecake  and it was really quite good  he insisted that my experience had not met their 100  satisfaction guarantee standards and my refund would stand   i say  thank you  mr  sendgraff  you are a credit to omaha steaks customer service and have restored my confidence completely   i m looking forward to my next purchase of an omaha steaks product  update of previous review,1,0

5055,i like hot things and usually when items boast being hot  they re usually somewhere in the medium range  i have to say that this one is pretty hot for not being a specialty product meant to raise eyebrows  flavor is pretty good  the meat in this brand  general western s meat flavor not flavor type  is on the tangy side and texture more soft compared to tillamook and other more traditional beef sticks  but it doesn t seem greasy  the sticks are also smaller which is ok with me  the casing may be  natural   but i d say manufactured and not intestine which i tend to prefer overall  not my favorite stick or flavor  but the quality is good  price is fair  they warn that cajun is their  spiciest   and everyone has differing tastes  that s not their fault  so i they still get 5 from me  by the way  i followed with a purchase of the peppered bacon which i like better  pretty good  hot stuff   ,1,0
5031,this is one of my favorite coffee additions  starts the day off well   so i was very sad when i got the box  not properly packed in the outer box  eight of 30 vials were broken and unusalble   the spill of sticky liquid was fortunately contained in the product plastic wrap  just another week of not feelling as good as i d like  broken vials ,1,0
5034,used to buy these all the time at the small general store near my old home in vermont   upon moving back to connecticut  i could never find these   finally thought to look on amazon  and not only are they just like i remembered  they re way cheaper buying in bulk actually  not just like i remembered   these are way more moist and tasty than when i used to buy them   i assume the ones in the store were probably old and stale which is why they were more like leather in their consistency  while these are like thick fruit rollups will definitely be buying these again  really good,1,0

5051,i like xango but one of the two boxes recently ordered showed signs of leakage of the product  the inside of the box was purple with xango juice  however the bottles were sealed  storing the bottles on their sides in a cupboard also caused two of the bottles to drip  though very slowly  i did have to break a seal to open the bottles i will likely order more but may discontinue if such leakage continues to occur  xango bottles leaked,1,0

5049,this garlic product will sting your mouth about two thirds as strongly as fresh  raw garlic cloves   this indicates to me that the beneficial phytochemicals have not been damaged too severely   in order to eat this product  you can reduce the  sting  in your mouth by using this dried garlic on top of other food   to completely eliminate the  sting  in your mouth  simply rehydrate this dried garlic with water   this product is slightly less healthful but substantially more convenient to use than fresh  raw garlic cloves  occasional dark brown chunks among the tiny  yellow garlic chunks   not a serious defect,1,0

5045,i ve never had a canned mushroom that comes close to what a fresh  shroom tastes  the canning process really does a number on the texture  and dials down the taste big time  but  when time is tight and pizza is on the agenda  canned is the quickest option i ve been buying this brand at sam s club for a few months and have been pleased with them  the texture  like all canned mushrooms  is very soft  but this brand seems to taste a bit better than other canned brands i ve tried  plus  the pieces are mostly large they won t hold a candle to fresh  and also take a back seat to a good quality dried mushroom  but for dishes where the mushroom is not the star  such as a pizza topping   these are not bad  not bad for a canned mushroom,1,0

5042,my baby had bad reflux and spit up and we tried multiple formulas including those specifically made for spit up   the similac organic is the first one that he has shown very little to no spit up after eating   great for him  bad for me because it is a bit pricier   not sure what is different about it that it affects his spit up differently but happy it works   i did run out and used some packets we had on hand of another formula and the spit up immediately returned   i knocked down one star because i really don t understand why the label  organic  has to mean much more money   health should be affordable and accessible  great for spit up,1,0

5035,i purchased another brand sold on amazon  and the taste was strong  unpleasant  possibly rancid the difference with this brand is that it has been specially processed for mild flavor and the stearines removed so that the product is a clear oil  instead of a semi solid  if you are taking this for health reasons  i highly recommend this more is explained on their website  exceptionally mild flavor  buy this one for health,1,0
5043,when i received the product  the container had exploded in side the box and the sugar was all over the bag   thank god for the bag because the product would have been unusable   the shrink wrap seals were broken and they were not big enough to adequately protect the container   you should investigate for further packaging ideas to protect your product   aside from that the color was perfect and it met all my needs  shipping disaster,1,0

5185,clipper is my favourite brand of chai tea  i ve tried several brands over the years i have bought the clipper chai in the uk frequently  and in the us only once so far  recently i found a single box of clipper chai in a small tj maxx store for a couple of dollars  and snapped it up  apparently tea that is packaged for sale in different regions of the world  even by the same company  can have a different taste   i once wrote to the twinings tea customer service department to ask about the us and uk earl grey flavour differences that i was perceiving in their products  and they admitted that the twinings us and uk earl grey flavours were different  because their flavours are modified based on what the consumers in each country region seem to prefer in the case of the clipper chai  i m not sure if it s my imagination  but their us market chai tea that i got at tj maxx a few weeks ago might taste a tiny bit different from their uk chai tea    or maybe that is just a function of the us market tea bags  being sealed in individual packets instead of intermingling unprotected in a cardboard box  relatively open to the air  like most uk market tea bags are   in any event  their us market chai tea is very good  clipper is my favorite tea,1,0
5184,my 4 stars is for the original price    i bought a 35  bag of hi tek naturals lamb meal for less active and large breeds in 10 6 12 for  36 80  only a week later it is over double this price   76 34 on 10 11 12    it is a good dog food  but for  36  it is not worth over 75 dollars  i hope they get such a decrease in revenue that they revert to their original price as for this food itself  i do like hi tek brand and have tried multiple foods  my dog likes all of them fine  and her stools are smaller  less frequent  less smelly  the fat content of this less active formulation is 12  as opposed to the normal 16    hi tek chicken meal with sweet potato is my comparison   47 38 for 30  on 10 6 12   45 99 for 30  7 7 2012   however  the protein is decreased from the normal food   this one is 21  and normal food is 32   i believe this is a reflection in the decrease of the quality of ingredients  the first five ingredients in the less active formulation are  lamb meal  pearled barley  white rice  brown rice  whole milo  another grain  followed by pork meal and some vitamins  seems to me  a smart person would just buy the regular food and add some rice  the first five ingredients of the regular formulation are  chicken meal  sweet potato  peas  pork meal  egg followed by duck meal  salmon meal  and a bunch of fruits and vitamins bottom line  love hi tek  kinda upset about the price changes  this food is not worth a penny over the original formulation even though you get 5  more  in this food they just cut protein sources and fruits and added more  filler  like rice  drastic cost increases ,1,0
5183,i like this much better than splenda  it s satisfyingly sweet  the first time i used it  it was in a glass of iced tea  i ended up using too much and it was too sweet  that saying something since i love very sweet tea  it did have a bit of an aftertaste that time 0 i didn t notice any aftertaste when i didn t use too much  it s container has two lids  one for pouring and one for spooning ingredients are  erythritol  sugar  monk fruit extract  molasses 4 5 stars  i liked it  i d buy this  nectresse,1,0

5188,this is the fourth item from  tiptree  that i ve tried    their  little scarlett strawberry  is out of this world   the regular  strawberry  and  damson   plum  were also very good    truth be told  i found myself a bit surprised at first taste  being it s somewhat bitter aside from random u s  marmalade s  i have tried one of  mrs  bridges   a scottish  orange  marmalade  of which  there was no bitterness the previous reviewer said this one from  tiptree  is made from  seville  oranges  which neither the website nor my jar indicates however  i just read some info on  seville  oranges  and they are supposed to be bitter  they come from the mediterranean    one page stated that no  pectin  is required   since this particular one does not contain  pectin   as some other marmalade s of  tiptree  do   this could very well be made from seville s fyi  the label also states   45 grams of fruit per 100 grams  with that said  after a few times of eating it now  i m quite used it s unique flavor  and find it delicious on toast   for those who aren t keen on a slightly bitter spread  perhaps you should steer clear of at least this particular blend flavor from  tiptree     p s  i just read a review on their  tawny   orange  thick cut   which said it s also bitter  in conclusion  i hope to try another of their marmalade s in the near future   tiptree  orange marmalade  medium cut   slightly bitter  but good ,1,0
5179,the seller shipped very quickly and with secure packaging  such that the product all arrived frozen solid  shipping obviously was a little high  especially for those of us used to having the amazon prime shipping deal  but it was reasonable compared to other sellers i had looked into the actual product packaging is also well thought out  each rectangular box  which stacks well in the freezer and conserves space  contains two vacuum packed plastic bundles  each of which contains three bison patties  separated by butcher s paper  the outer boxes are sturdy enough to support and stack well without getting limp from moisture etc   and the inner plastic wrappings appear secure and so far haven t leaked  a problem i ve had with many meat products in the past few years  being someone who has consumed a lot of bison  i was a little dubious upon seeing these patties described as  80 20   which generally means 80  meat and 20  fat  my concern there was because bison has virtually no fat  my understanding is that one cannot really even find enough fat on the animal to add it to the ground meat to up the fat percentage for burgers  so i suspected  and this may be true  that this product has some beef fat added to it  the patties also hold together well  unusual for ground bison  and they don t have quite the normal dark red color  either still  upon cooking the patties  they appear to be pure bison texture wise  and they taste like pure bison  if a little fattier than normal  they did release a fair amount of liquid  again abnormal for ground bison   so i do think something  extra  has been added  however  this is probably due to the fact that people expect  burgers  to have a certain cohesiveness and slightly fatty taste  and regular ground bison is actually difficult to form into a burger due to its leanness  anyway   i wasn t overly concerned by the end about these issues  although i think such things should be clarified in the packaging information as well as on any websites where the product is being sold  i have encountered  100  pure bison  labels on products that had at least 10  beef added  i ve even encountered claims stating that the  law  required them to add beef  which is nonsense   anyway  could be i m mistaken and these really are 100  bison  but in the end  after cooking  it appears that is what you are eating  even if beef fat was added the burgers shrank a bit in cooking  but that s normal for burgers  they remained a good size and i have enjoyed them  i would probably buy them again  even though i am still a little unsure about the mix issue  good if possibly adulterated basic bison patties,1,0

5175,when i was much younger  i actually popped popcorn for a living  for both united artists theaters and general cinema  this salt is  as far as i can recall  exactly what i used there  and in my own experiments this salt creates the correct color and taste in your movie theater style popcorn but  and this is a big but  i only used 1 2 teaspoon for a typical  large bowl  batch of popcorn  any more and the flavor became too salty imo  for a camping trip recently  i popped about 10 pounds of popcorn for my campmates over the course of 4 days  and i still have at least 4 5 of the 35 oz carton left  your mileage may vary  but i think one of these cartons would easily flavor about 30 40 pounds of popcorn so  my advice is definitely get some of this salt  but get one carton and order more later if you really need it i rated the product at 4 out of 5 stars because the quantity in a 35 oz carton is simply too much even for wild popcorn maniacs  and it is not obvious from their description of the product how much you should really buy  great stuff   but one carton will last a lifetime ,1,0

5172,the first time i tasted cacao nibs i thought they were very strange  but  after seeing on doctor oz that these are healthy and may help boost metabolism  i tried them again   now  i look forward to my 2 tablespoons a day   i should mention that i am basically a chocolate lover  but when i tried these the second time around i had given up my daily dose of dark chocolate   perhaps that was what helped me get over the fact that these have no sugar  i was no longer used to eating the sweet chocolate  so this no longer seemed bitter to me   i now use these in baking  as well   i put the wet ingredients of a recipe into a blender with one or two tablespoons of the nibs and process the ingredients until the nibs are grounded down and no longer chunky  and people are amazed at the way my chocolate cakes taste  acquired a taste  now i love these,1,0

5169,as a patron of generation x i refused to partake in the recent fad that is energy drinks  it seems that everywhere i look nowadays i see other 20 something year olds clinging to their monster energy drinks and slim shiny cans of red bull  i never fell for the marketing ploy of energy sugar water but still need that pick me up for the daily grind  since all night high school and college cram sessions i have become a coffee guru  ive tried numerous brands  cool coffee makers and travel press mugs and can easily discuss coffee with anyone for hours at a time during a recent drag a truck driver gifted me with a tiny stok cup  i gulped it down shooter style and found it to taste like a mild albeit watered down cup of tepid black coffee  the taste of caffeine is prevelant but not overwhelming  nothing enjoyable but not at all bitter or gross  anyone familiar with espresso will be well akin with it  within minutes i was wide eyed and bushytailed just as if i had drank a full cup of french roast  it was a mild alertness not overly caffinated jitters or quick ramp of energy like that of a 5 hour energy  stok is litterly the efficiency of coffee in a no nonsense delivery  of course i was impressed by this and immediately purchased this years supply from amazon as it is quite hard to find elseware  i have been experimenting with different blends and found that it compliments eight o clocks house blend quite well when mixed with half and half  just helps to punctuate the taste and of course deliver some extra caffeine the only detail i am confused about is why they suggest only two a day  humans can safely consume 500mg of caffeine where these only pack a modest 40mg  in fact a mere 7oz of drip coffee contains over 100mg of caffeine  regardless of that fact it still seems to do its job and i am more than happy sucking them down whil smirking at the monster drinkers and their  4 super extreme mega special edition cans of putrid sweet tart tasting fiz juice  supurb idea  works great in tandem with beverages ,1,0

5190,for some reason they are no longer making wolfgang puck hawaiian hazelnut k cups  my absolute favorite flavor  after i got over my shock and sadness i looked around at other options and found these  54 pods for  20  yes please  i put the coffee into the my k cup attachment for my keurig and brew that way  and the taste is the same  if not better  than the k cups were a disclaimer  i still have no idea what these pods are actually meant to be used in  i didn t even know what i was getting when i purchased it  at first i thought it was just loose coffee inside individual packages  which is close but not accurate   inside the package is the loose coffee inside a filter i first tried to just stick the filter and coffee in the my k cup  and the result was pretty watery  so then i decided to rip the filter open and dump the loose coffee into the my k cup  this works great  although it takes 1 and a half packs per my k cup  so just keep that in mind if you are purchasing these  delicious  using with my k cup,1,0

5136,i was impressed with the taste and quality of other virginia diner products  so i gave these a try i was not disappointed   like all virginia diner peanut products  they came vacuum sealed with a heavy liner keeping the vacuum in   you ll hear the hiss when you break the seal   the nuts are fresh and crunchy however  the product picture makes them either look larger than they are  or it makes the container look smaller than it is   these are average sized peanuts  the same size as you would buy in the store   the container is larger than it looks in the picture   the nuts are mostly halves  with a few whole nuts and very few pieces they are not as spicy as the title  cajun  would suggest   at first  you barely notice the spice   it builds a little as you eat more  but not very much   a nice flavor  but less than i expected   minus one star for not being  nearly  spicy enough  but four stars for the superior quality  good  but not very spicy,1,0

5132,i was on a ferry from seattle to victoria and the waters got rough and the crew started passing these around   i was skeptical  but tried them and found that while my stomach was a little uneasy  i was certainly not as sick as i had been in similar experiences in the past   i was still skeptical as to whether it was the ginger that helped or if  maybe  i had just outgrown sea sickness  but a couple of months later when i went whale watching  i realized that i had definitely not outgrown it   so  when my family came to visit and we decided to go to disneyland  i decided to buy this candy   a lot of the rides make me queasy and can send me to the sidelines for 15   30 minutes   way too long for kids to sit around and wait   anyway  i found this candy really did help   i had a piece about every hour and then also immediately before and after a fast crazy ride   it wasn t as though the motion sickness was completely eliminated  but it was greatly diminished   i went from being sick to being a little uneasy   and it definitely didn t last long   i didn t need to sit down at all  i just kept going and a few minutes later  i was completely back to normal btw   these don t taste bad  especially after you ve had a few  they are different tasting enough that your kids probably won t be bugging you for a piece all the time  which is a bonus  works great for motion sickness ,1,0

5117,we grind this a bit  just enough to break the seed when making sourdough rye bread  only use 3 tablespoons for three loaves but it adds the sour zingy taste that just takes the bread out of this world  taste wise  when we got it  my initial thought was that it would go stale by the time we got through the huge 10 oz jar  but it keep pretty fresh almost all the way to the end  we did replace it before it was totally used up  i guess we might have gotten another batch or two of bread from it  but at the price  even tossing that little bit away  it was a bargain  can t be beat ,1,0

5158,i rescued my havanese dog from a breeder who was going to put her down for a hip deformity  turns out the hip was fine but the ball on her leg bone was broken sometime when she was a puppy  it caused her immense pain when moved in certain positions and caused her to limp  running fast was out of the question and jumping was only for the lowest of heights  even when she sat her left leg would be out to the side at an awkward angle  she was stuck in a catch 22  she couldn t make it stronger because it hurt and it hurt because it was so weak we tried glucosamine supplements  but they were powdery and she seemed to not like the taste  the chicken jerky with glucosamine all seemed to be from china with an fda advisory for liver and kidney problems that s when i found zukes hip action  the first time i opened the package the dog danced on her hind legs just to get a better sniff  the squares are soft and dense  they split into smaller pieces easily for training or to extend the reward time  the dog is sure to find even the smallest crumb  these treats last a long time with a small medium sized dog like mine   the bag makes a satisfying crinkle sound the dogs listens for  i really like that they are high quality and made in america the improvement began immediately and after a few weeks of daily treats the difference was in the use of her hind leg was amazing  more cushion and flex in her hip let her use her leg more  now she is much more active with better behavior and lots more running and jumping  she even sits down with both legs under her  another thing i noticed was when she would lay in her bed on her back her bad leg would be pulled in  now both legs spread out like normal for easier tummy rubs  when she is being silly she even army crawls  i only wish we had found them sooner  if you saw this dog running around you would never know she had a hip problem in the past  fixed my dogs hip,1,0

5152,i believe it worked  not like magic  but did increase my supply  i struggled a lot at the beginning  does not seem to have side effects on me  would recommend this  i think it worked,1,0
5151,it is a great tasting  coffee  but in fact it is more akin to a hot chocolate than a coffee   the flavor is coffee  not chocolate y   but  i noticed it didn t give me the pep as my other kcups  so i decided to open one of the cappuccino kcups and noticed that  unlike my coffee kcups  this was only a powdery mix   not ground coffee placed over a filter   the standard innards   if you are ok with the idea that this is a coffee equivalent of a hot chocolate powder mix  then this is a great tasting buy  with less pep than coffee  good flavor  not real coffee,1,0
5150,the heat of the peppers varies dramatically between peppers and between different parts of the pepper   the hottest part is the white part next to the seeds while the red shell is less so   after gifting some peppers to some friends at the office i removed the stems and ground the remainder   basically filling a baby food jar  smoky flavor   i assume they dried over coals   i tried germinating some seeds   no luck  the heat from drying probably killed the seeds  the real deal    smoky flavor noticeable but not too strong,1,0
5149,treacle one of the highest sources of dietary potassium available   30 grams of this is equivalent to two full potatoes  three or more bananas  12 16 oz of fish   if you like this and want to easily boost your potassium  and possibly lower your blood pressure and risk of other diseases  this can be one easy way to do so  bitter tasting for a reason   1400mg potassium   30g,1,0
5146,taste is ok  but too sweet and too much sugar may keep me away from this sauce  also won t recommend using it without cooking  since the oder seems raw  a little bit too sweet,1,0
5145,i guess the best way to review these is by flavor   some starlight mints can have a cheap plastic like taste  and these do not  they re nothing special  but at   16 oz they are more than adequate for desk candy  what is there to say about mints,1,0
5142,this is a nice berry flavored herbal tea in which the vanilla accents but does not overwhelm the fruit  i call it  berry flavored   though  because it does not seem distinctly blackberry  the ingredients list reads  hibiscus flowers  rosehips  sweet blackberry leaves  natural flavor  dried black current  sic  pieces  dried blackberry pieces  dried blueberry pieces  dried raspberry pieces  sunflower lecithin   so do not think of this as a  blackberry  tea i sweeten my tea and thought the flavor was lovely  but my husband  who does not like to sweeten his tea  thought it was a bit sour the pyramid bag is very pretty and adds to the aesthetics of the brewing and the presentation when serving guests  but i do not see that it adds anything to the tea itself this will not replace my favorite lipton quietly chamomile  but it makes a pleasant change  nice berry tea in a pretty package,1,0
5400,i love this product as it is a soft  melt in your mouth variant of popcorn that poses no threat to the teeth for those of us  past a certain age    i e  no threats of teeth chipping kernels  etc   i would love to have the convenience of purchasing it via amazon  but not for this inflated price  the shipping charge i understand  but not  5 over the price on the bag  fantastic product but horribly overpriced here,1,0
5401,the product works well and my dog did not have any adverse reaactions   it would be nice if the company included something to reduce itching because of dry skin  and other reasons   it is hard to tell if my pet s scratching is due to fleas or dry skin  works well,1,0
5402,just purchased my first bottle  chilled from local duane reade  and all i can say is    it tastes like water  yes  the dark color is off putting but taste wise it was normal as compared to water cooler water i wish it was less costly   won t be drinking 3 day  but that s only due to price i ve read the negative reviews with fascination because my experience is the opposite  tastes like        water ,1,0
5403,mimicreme is great  bought it at a health food store in the spring  but not at  43 and change for 16 oz  either number of product per package is not listed  or people must be willing to spend dollars per ounce  mimicreme 16 oz,1,0
5673,starbucks via just work  you can stash them anywhere so when you are ready they are too  threw our coffee pot away a couple of years ago  works,1,0
5672,this is a good tasting bottle of water   it is not unlike many other brands tastewise  but did seem to has a smooth feel to it as i drank   there are many health claims attached to the product to which i cannot speak   i had one bottle  so verifying any health effect would not be possible  its wet ,1,0
5671,this is very overpriced  chinese markets used to sell them for 75 cents a can  but because of their popularity in new york they now sell them for around 2 50 a can  it is very salty  and you can even eat the bones  it sounds strange  but if you like salty goodness then you will love this black bean fish  surprisingly addicting,1,0
5670,bearing in mind that i wasn t trying to imitate coffee  if i want coffee  i will just drink coffee since i don t have any issues with caffeine or coffee   so i wasn t expecting it to taste like coffee  that s not what i was going for  i must say  it s good  it s got a much smoother flavor than coffee  some would call it  weak  but i don t like strong coffee  either   really nutty and grain y  meaning  it tastes like grain  not that it has a gritty texture   very little if any bitterness to speak of  maybe the bitterness comes out if you add more crystals   on it s own it has a nice sweetness and mild flavor  i m not a black coffee drinker  yuck   and i ll occasionally drink tea  black   certain types of tea   but this is definitely enjoyable on its own  if you add creamer it really does taste similar to coffee  if you handed me a cup of cafix with creamer and told me it was coffee   i would probably believe you  though i might think your coffee tasted a bit  off    you definitely need to make it stronger for creamer though   unlike coffee  my flavored coffee mate completely overwhelms this stuff  i like this   ,1,0
5668,we had our son on gentlease since he was 4 months old due to our son not being able to tolerate similac advance  he was horribly gassy and fussy   his dr diagnosed him with mild ar so she advised us to add some ceral to the gentlease  i tasted the gentlease as i taste everything my son eats and omg it was horrible   the cereal helped to mask the bitterness and our son drank it for 4 months   as our son got older  ate more and more solids  i wanted to stop with the cereal in his bottles  but he wouldn t drink the gentlease w o the cereal    his dr said she had no problem with us switching to enfamil premium   i was very scared to do so  as i read horrible reviews about the dual prebiotics causing loose stools   our son has been on this premium formula for 3 weeks now and we are very pleased  we noticed larger stools but that is not bad considering the gentlease constipated our son at times   the cereal our son was getting did contain the pre and probiotics so maybe his gi system was already adjusted to them  but i am so glad he is drinking this formula and it tastes so much better than gentlease   for those complaining about the packaging   you re supposed to dump the bag into the container  yes  it is a bit messy but it s definitely not something i would change formula brands over  that is just plain ridiculous   if the formula is working  don t go changing it because you get a little bit of powder on your hands  get a grip people  very pleased,1,0
5667,my kids were so excited to get this in the mail   we make hot chocolate now with our keurig and they were missing the marshmallows these work great   but i got the bottle on oct 22  2012 my husband checked the run out date and it was oct 23  2012   wish they would pay closer attention to this when shipping products my husband is a very close watcher of these run out dates  watch run out date,1,0
5666,i was thrilled to see the international cafe orange back with new packaging  i was able to find it in both target and walmart  now it s gone again  i see i could buy it on line but that s very pricey  my next thought is to see if our grocery would special order me a case  it s all i drink and i hope it isn t off the market for good  does anyone else know where it can be found  hard to find,1,0
5674,she had no problem eating this all day long and she never threw it up so it can t be that bad   i switched her to an all wet diet since then though because this did not seem to control her weight  our cat could eat this all day long,1,0
5665,i found this coffee masters flavor to be somewhat lacking in flavor   i expected a rich  aromatic pumpkin flavoring and aroma and alas  found none   with the holidays approaching  i thought this would be a great tradition creator  but it simmply did not carry the day as i had hoped  mild pumpkin pie flavor   a little light on the flavor,1,0
5662,first the positive   excellent product and i could  and have  eaten whole bags at a time   i know a princess who is also a magician  she makes them disappear  blink and your nuts vanish   well amazon let me down this time   i bought a pkg  12oz   and then  on amazon also  found 4 six ounce bags  for the same price  let the buyer beware i guess   next  when i received them  they were all melted together  two messy chunks   also  they were advertised as 12 ounce  i was sent 11 ounce packages  for what i paid  1 ounce is a lot  oh yeah  and i bought two bags  double whammy   then i wanted them fast soon  so  i paid 4  extra shipping  hit the place order button    8 dollars shipping   whoops   that was  4 per item   well   never again  next pkg is coming from the local store   dw mauna ripoff,1,0

5660,this product is simply the best organic whole grain brown rice gluten free cereal that i have ever tasted   it is crispy and flavorful  and it stays that way even when sitting in almond milk   so if the phone rings or you finish reading that fascinating article  you won t return to a mushy mess  simply the best   ,1,0
5659,i haven t ordered  but i m confused  is this a 16 oz bag for forty something dollars  while others are around 12oz for like  15  expensive ,1,0
5658,the bee cake decorations were a very cute addition to my daughter s 1st birthday cake and cupcakes   the best thing about the purchase was that they were packaged exceptionally well      not a single bee was broken or damaged during shipping  bee utiful cake decorations,1,0
5657,both of my cats could care less about ingredients because  junk  food seems to rule the day   taste over ingredients matters  i do not like to alter their diet  but if i m lucky enough to find a good pet food offering both taste and ingredients i ll stick with it  regardless of cost  changing formulas is routine  but i seldom radically alter their diet  this is a big advantage as i ve found that not all premium formulas work  there s no real correlation between cost and taste  i have tossed a lot of  premium  formulas i have 2 healthy  adult cats  and they are both  finicky  eaters  not only do they like merrick  but i am thankful that my guys like something with healthy ingredients  taste over ingredients,1,0
5656,i have been drinking bai for several months on a daily basis  when the blend is right it is great  however  earlier the producer s quality control was very far from good  out of every box usually there were 1 or 2 bottles that were  off   they did not taste uniform and had unmacerated solid material floating in the bottle  i hope it was fruit   it was very unappetizing and just nasty looking  lately the product appears to be much more uniform  i don t know if anyone else experienced this lack of quality control but it was bad  very good but not perfect,1,0
5664,been trying to find a grass that would grow and couldn t  they would just mold  so we ordered and our cat loves it   cat grass,1,0
5655,the quality is good but its more like eating seeds than clusters   there is no way you can just grab a handful and go   you have to have them as a topper on yogurt or oatmeal   this product would rock if it was in clusters   i will not be purchasing it again because of this reason not so cluster y,1,0
5675,obviously food for the wealthy pet owner  they ll never miss  60 for measly 24lb bag nor having to fork out  34 for 12cans cs which amounts to nearly  3 per 12oz can  pedigree is 68cents a can and our black lab always gets complimented for her coat  she reminds us of a miniature black horse with a shiny illustrious mane  so blue  yah nu uh  dogs can t read and are always happy to see their owners feed them even if it s table scraps where both the owner and dog know it s real meat  bones with marrow  vegetables and wheat  if was more competitive maybe just maybe but they re not so why bother  high priced,1,0
5677,does what it needs to do  i ve tried other brands that taste disgusting and this one actually tastes like candy  gu not gross,1,0
5694,i got this at a local grocery  it was 2 pkgs of ten on sale for  3  i had not tried it before  so thought i would try it  at that price  there is not much downside i like it  as with the other flavors of this product i have tried the lemonade flavor dominates over the cranberry flavor it is not as sweet tasting as the cran grape flavor ocean spray on the go sugar free cran grape 10 per box  but i liked it enough that i will probably buy it again  tart and sweet at the same time,1,0
5693,this flavor is very intense  i can t drink it without making funny faces and i prefer the grape or original flavors but i love the concept of donating to avon foundation for women breast cancer crusade mammograms are not an efficient way to diagnose breast cancer but it s really all we have  you can literally have breast cancer for years before it shows on a mammogram  what we need is a blood test  much like the psa test men have to diagnose prostate cancer that s why i support donating to the avon foundation  they are more upfront about what they spend the donations on  unlike another popular breast cancer foundation  and they are pro cure but they are also for finding better ways of diagnosing because the earlier breast cancer is treated  the better the survival rates anyway  this flavor of 5 hour energy works every bit as well as their other flavors and part of your money will go for a great cause  intense flavor   love the concept,1,0
5692,i bought this curry because i heard it tasted just like coco s curry  coco ichibanya is a curry house in okinawa japan  and i was not disappointed   very delicious   i just wish it was hotter  coco ichibanya,1,0
5691,we used this bbq sauce all the time in california   didn t know what we were missing until we looked for it on line   we purchased a couple of bottles to begin with   then we bought 2  6 packs    if i could store a barrel of it i would buy one    too bad it is not shelf price a bit expensive but if you are frugal it is worth the cost   spetacular ,1,0
5690,this is not for the weak  it requires work and i mean daily maintenance to grow your grains and maintain them  i can buy a few people getting  bad grains  but most are probably irritated by how much work it is  you have to keep them fed and alive and you have to care  it s ok if you give up and decide it s just not for you  but don t blame the seller for your own issues  my sister in law got me interested but her milk grains were suffering because she was using raw milk  she researched  not me  that using low pasturized milk helped to grow the grains so when i bought my own  from this seller  i took her advice and used low pasturized milk only as a start  holy cow  i uploaded a picture of my grain and it is huge  that is just one grain mind you  i have either gifted the others  used them for making cheese or  sniff  sniff  tossed them in the disposal because i don t need that much kefir  most of my grains i have gifted have been murdered because the folks who took them didn t like the maintenance they require  it is hard work people  but it s all about what you are willing to put yourself through for good health  it s ok if you can t handle it  life is hard enough but like i said  don t blame the seller just because you couldn t hack it  just fyi  more sis in law research here  for a casein and lactose free diet you must let the grains sit for at least 25   28 hours  i screwed up and only did 24 hrs and my son is supposed to be on a casein free diet so be careful    it s a science after all  my grain is now large enough that i can use raw milk but i have noticed i still have to rock back and forth between low pasturized and raw in order to keep the grain healthy  i m sure some folks would disagree with me but i m just going on my own experience here and the proof is in the pudding so to speak  have fun  it requires work people ,1,0
5689,we have 2 cats and they both just love this flavor of temptations   when it is treat time they both just sit and look at my husband until they get them and there is not a crumb left  cat treats,1,0
5688,i found these very good  but  they are really small  a bit pricey for the size of the pops  want to try to find them cheaper   note  i do not rate items based on pricing  the rating should be on the consumer s like or dislike of the product  drives me crazy when i see someone give an item a low rating because of the price  because when you push the button to order  you ve agreed to pay the price listed   taste just like dr pepper,1,0
5676,gummi bears arrived quickly and in good shape  not melted or all stuck together   the grape flavor was not too artificial or overly sugary   they made a great addition to our candy bar  good flavor  not too artificial,1,0
5687,i wish my cats would eat this  one cat will lick up all the liquid  eat some of the shredded chicken but not all  bummer cause this is the cleanest canned cat food i ve come across  from the smell you d never think this was a cat food unfortunately petco only had the good karma chicken dinner adult canned cat food in gravy   99 per can  or i would have gotten all of their offerings i ve recently taken in  or been taken in by  a stray and he will not eat anything but safeway s mom to mom chicken baby food  and california natural chicken and brown rice dry  weird and totally frustrating  which is how i came across this soulistic btw  my other cat has been getting real finicky for the past couple of yrs  smells like chicken    not like cat food at all   o ,1,0
5685,a great way to save money on buying k cups   in supermarkets these go for about 8 9 bucks for 12 cups   you save so much money buying them in bulk like this  if you use them regularly   i just picked up the 96 count after buying the 48 count 3 months in a row  i ve been buying these regularly for months now ,1,0

5678,my dad loves sardines  but doesn t like the sharp little bones that are usually in the cans   at one time  a local box store carried boneless sardines  but not anymore so  i went to amazon to look for these boneless sardines  yes  i informed my dad of the price   double the price of sardines with bones  but for him it was worth the priceof not having to dig through and separate those tiny boats from the fish  furthermore  if one doesn t eat those tiny bones  a lot of what is in the can is just waste anyway so  i ordered a pack of 10 cans some months back and now my dad was ready for more  if someone goes back for a product again  you know it s good  great tasting sardine without having to pick bones,1,0
5686,i love smart water but not at twice the price  sam s club has the same 12 pack for  10 48  ouch  twice the price ,1,0

5651,i like the tea     i am not positive that it helps my allergies but i like it and i like the rather bitter  tangy taste  tea for ones allergies                  ,1,0
5622,first of all  i agree with the other reviewers  way to expensive here on amazon  you can save at least  10 00 if you pick it up a your local sams club  that is where i got mine  sad to say since amazon makes it so convenient with that out of the way     lively colombian by folgers should be categorized as a medium dark roast to me  not everyone has the same taste buds but i found it to be a wee bit on the bitter side  even at the largest cup  would i buy this again  yes  i don t mind it being a wee bit bitter but in my opinion colombian coffee should be bold   smooth tasting not bold   bitter  i know diedrich colombia coffee has that bold   smooth taste i prefer  there must be something in the word  lively  that folgers put on this box to indicate that it may be bitter  like i said  not everyone has the same taste buds so if you are the least bit hesitant about the word  bitter  i typed here  i would suggest you get this k cup in a variety pack first instead of buying this 80 count then regretting it later  would call this a medium dark roast,1,0
5621,as demerara sugar cubes  these are basically identical to any other product of their type  so there s no point in describing subjective attributes  the notable thing here is the price  the most well known and widely distributed brand  la perruche  typically costs  8  per box  both here on amazon and elsewhere   whereas these cost roughly half that for the same quantity of product  so if you re in the market for demerara sugar cubes  get these  it s a no brainer  why buy the other brand when you can buy this ,1,0

5616,i had decided packaged oatmeal was a disappointing mush   umpqua oats won me over   always warm and hearty  with just the right amounts of sweet  salty  and whole oats   mostly sunny and kick start are my two favorites  but i ordered the 12 variety pack to change it up a bit  and was not disappointed  i love this company ,1,0

5608,i really appreciate being able to toss a packet into my diaper bag for going out   although i am breast feeding  nothing is worse than a super hungry 3 month old at a time when i cannot immediately feed him   so  i carry a bottle and a pack of formula just in case   i have also measured formula into ziploc baggies  but it is not nearly as easy to pour and is less convenient  extremely convenient,1,0
5607,the coffee taste great and for the price you cannot beat it  however  not sure yet how well it works in our keurig coffee maker  it seems to me the flow is somewhat restricted  maybe it has something to do with the k cup design  this k cup is not made of plastic  instead it is a filter mesh like material  not bad coffee for the price  howerver,1,0
5606,after reading reviews on several products designed for popping corn that renders a theatre like taste to the popped product  without one having to add flavored salts or ancillary toppings   i decided that coconut oil would be the safest and most satisfactory route   paragon s gallon container of a coconut oil  specifically targeted at popcorn lovers  seemed the best choice   and in many ways it probably is  but it has some aspects that disappointed   1  the container of oil arrived on a 66 degree day in a near solid form  way more solid than a can of vegetable shortening     2  its heavy jar is awkward to maneuver and the small mouth of the jar makes it quite difficult to  scoop out  extract three tablespoons of the product    3  as this coconut popcorn oil apparently becomes quite solid under 70f temperatures  one may not be able to easily transfer the contents to more user friendly containers    4  in three comparison popping sessions  this paragon oil left more un popped kernels than did vastly lower priced  pure canola oil  and   5  lastly  the popped flavor of this coconut oil indeed is good but not stellar   crisco s pure canola oil left a lighter and not unappealing taste  ok  but not as fabulous as expected ,1,0
5605,i bought a couple of these from my local grocery store and was so sorry i had not bought more  these are so gooey chewy and full of flavor  i never did try them warm just straight out of the bag  i have been looking for them for the last few months and have not had any luck in finding them in stock  so as always amazon comes to the rescue and was able to order them  like one of the other reviewers pointed out  if you like hard and crunchy these are not for you   wow    ,1,0
5604,i can t speak of the benefits yet  but i ll comment on the taste  it doesn t really taste like ginger  it tastes like the spiciness left behind after you ve eaten a sliver of it  it doesn t taste good  it s drinkable  but not pleasant  it s really spicy  all i taste is spice  it s not  strong  per say though  it also has stevia in it  and i can taste it  and i hate stevia  leaves a bad aftertaste  i will only buy this again if i notice any benefits  but i m only on my second cup  tastes bad,1,0
5612,i ve been through 3 bags of this stuff and not had a single bad piece of jerky  i sometimes have to toss out half the bag if i buy a brand like jack links because of the nasty tough pieces definitely subscribing to this  a very tasty beef jerky with high quality control,1,0

5628,i m very happy with this product   one thing that did shock me was how fast i received it    i have it filled with all my flavors and one row for various creamers   everything is in one area   love it   i m also getting a second one for my desk   not for coffee  but for pens  pencils  markers  etc   i don t like those stand up containers   the dark mesh design matches the rest of the desk items and i can put other things on the top of it  simply smart,1,0
5650,isn t it odd   people get passionate about their sweeteners almost like football teams   i have a buddy who can only tolerate pink   i m a blue fan   neither one of us is a yellow fan  though i can tolerate stevia   i regret that costco no longer carries blue  so i had to get it here  at a higher cost than costco  true blue,1,0
5649,about two years ago we bought a product from china at costco that was  dog chews  i have an australian shepard that can chew up anything  and she ate the costco chews and was literally coughing up blood i couldn t imagine it was the product  after all costco is a good store we took her to the vet and she checked out fine so a month later the dog had been fine  decided to try again  same result  once sick dog  blood coming out of her mouth the chews did not cut her  we took her to the vet and he could find no reason for her to be bleeding  it was coming up from her throat  i called and reported this to a lot of people and heard from them similar stories  only thing that bothered me was costco didn t seem to care and didn t respond to our calls and letters  which were courteous  we didn t blame their store  just wanted them to know the product they were selling was harmful made me very upset that i was so stupid to trust anything from china  and especially that i gave it to my dog again  i still feel very badly about it  and have not bought anything from china since that day  nothing  not cloths or shoes  nothing  makes it hard to shop in wally world thank you for carrying these products  thank you for carrying this usa made item,1,0
5648,admittedly i m much more of a coffee drinker  and i opted to try this product more for the pyramid teabag design than the flavor the phramid bag design allowed for a much greater flow of water through the actual bag and  as a result  more of the ingredients are evenly infused  additionally  when you pull the bag out of the water  the string design allows for automatic  squeezing  of the bag  no more using your hands or a spoon to press extra water and flavor out not a fan of the flavor  while i do like blackberry and vanilla  this tea  even when steeped less than the required time  seemed extremely sweet  love the  bag  design  not the flavor,1,0
5646,i bought these for about  2 50 each 45 ounce jar  this is for a family size pot of spaghetti  it s not as sweet as i was hoping for  a traditional tomato basil sauce was always sweet when my grandmas from sicily made it   i suppose you could stir in some sugar while warming it if you like sweeter sauces  all natural ingredients  tomato puree  water  tomato paste  citric acid   diced tomatoes  sugar  soybean oil  salt  xtra virgin olive oil  dried onions  basil  spices  dried garlic  from the label  can get recipe ideas and extra at their website  www dot francescorinaldi dot com the plastic jar is strong stiff  i was able to store a 1 2 jar of this sauce in the freezer in the plastic jar it came in  and it didn t crack in the freezer  the lid is a plastic circle and a round metal disc  just like canning jars  i also used this sauce to dip bread sticks in  and added to pizza that was a little dry when delivered  i could not find a expiration date if you found this helpful  plz click on the  yes  box  thanx tasty and hearty,1,0
5643,this costs more and has the too many grains in it that cats aren t supposed to have in their diet  but they like it the most and eat it like candy  must be the flavoring  expensive and not healthy  but cats love it,1,0
5641,i bought this because i wanted to give my kids the experience of blowing a super bubble  i grew up in southern ca and i remember buying this gum for 3 cents a piece  the good thing is you can chew this for about an hour until it gets gross  plenty of time to make multiple bubbles  the sad thing is this package was hard as a rock  not bad after you chew it down for 15 min  but would of liked it to be a bit fresher  super bubbles ,1,0
5640,these are much better than the other major brand variety pack  much better outer layer  less  grainy  feeling in texture   taste  the filling is tastier also  i ll definitely buy these again but not the  grainy  brand  great tasting  great price ,1,0
5627,this is a wonderful candy  any time of year  cool mint  creamy white chocolate  individually wrapped  one big bag has like 28 pieces  sadly  when i open a bag  i usually eat about half of it     no wheat ingredients listed  but not listed as gluten free  great candy  chocolate and mint,1,0
5639,i have long been a fan of the tully kona blend coffee  i was disappointed when my local retailer quit selling kona products i actually ordered this house blend by accident  thinking that i was ordering the kona blend  i had more than 4 cups of coffee before i noticed on the packaging that it said house blend instead of kona blend  i would not have known that it was not the kona blend had i not seen the packaging  one caveat  i make  lattes  by adding an equal amount of steamed milk to my coffee  so the coffee flavor is probably diluted for me   someone drinking it straight up may notice a difference in the flavor my bottom line is that it is much less expensive than the kona blend  due to vendor and shipping costs  and it is more than good enough for me   i ve since ordered another box  less expensive alternative to the kona blend,1,0
5637,extremely easy to work with  i did not have any difficulty using this like others reported   i used a large kitchen knife to cut off a small section and did not microwave it to make it supple as recommended on the package   i simply kneeded it in my hands and then rolled it out   i like this product much better than the wilton fondant    much easier to use  better taste and it didn t  sugar  or change color over time   i made samples and left them out over a week and they still looked awesome a week later  extremely easy to work with,1,0
5635,this is good stuff for quick veggies and a little carbohydrate energy   sadly it might be cheaper at your grocery store than here  i like it too,1,0
5634,every complaint says that this product is misrepresented   however  the box clearly states organic whole wheat   quinoa blend also  the description on the page states   ingredientsorganic whole wheat durum flour  organic quinoa flour  i think the reviewers are misrepresenting their search skills and reading ability   if all else fails  always check the website of ancient harvest  or at least find a health foods store and look at the box  maybe a reading class would help ,1,0
5633,taste wise  nectresse has moved to the top of my list of no calorie sweetners   it s a blend of erthritol  sugar  monk fruit extract   molasses  erthritol  erythritol   listed as the first ingredient  is a sugar alcohol that has been approved for use as a food additive in the us   much of the world   it occurs naturally in some fruits and fermented foods   is 60 70  as sweet as table sugar  but is almost noncaloric  does not affect blood sugar  does not cause tooth decay   is less likely to cause gastric side effects than other sugar alcohols  all of the ingredients are almost noncaloric  but the suggested serving size of 1 4 tsp has virtually no calories   i find nectresse to provide sweetness in my tea or coffee without the unpleasant aftertaste of stevia or splenda  excellent no calorie sweetner,1,0
5632,rao s sauce is very similar to this one  but they stealth changed their ingredients and reduced their quality  this one is much better and tastes better  ontop of that  this is half the price at only 4 bucks a bottle instead of 9  if they do like rao s and reduce their quality then i will change my review count on it  and go back to buying organic tomatoes and making my own  i have np making my own but this is a great jar sauce  better than rao s,1,0
5631,so i do drink alot of tea  bagged  loose  with cream  without cream  sugar  lemon    what ever works for the tea   this tea is overall just tea and really not worth the extra cost   i found it to be a bit bland weak when brewed to directions and bitter if left to sit too long   this is in a class with any of the mass market breakfast tea  it s just tea  nothing that amazing,1,0
5629,it may be an acquired taste  but if you like canned octopus and you know how to prepare it  vigo won t disappoint you  consistently tasty,1,0
5638,i bought my first box of fuggedaboudit about two months back   i was only able to have three or four cups out of 12 k cups of coffee   the seals would pop off causing the grounds to go everywhere   this was a huge issue as coffee grounds are one of the most difficult things to get completely cleaned up i wrote an email to the manufacture about this issue   they responded promptly and even admitted the issue   these days it is uncommon for a company to accept responsibility   this was a step in the right direction   after apologizing  they told me they were going to send me some coffee out of the new batch   i expected a couple of cups  instead i received almost a whole months  worth   they definitely gave me a reason to give them a second try the new k cups work flawlessly   every cup is good and the flavor is consistent   so far i have tried the fuggedaboudit  cyclone  and the french roast   these are all darker blends which can have a tendency to be bitter  but not these   they are all very smooth and flavorful don t let the bad reviews about the cups scare you away   the manufacturer has stepped up and fixed the problem   i will be buying coffee from brooklyn bean roastery again  great coffee  great customer service,1,0
5697,i bought those things for my chinese friend  she said those cereals  we called babaozhou  were really closed to what she had at china  but she also said that those cereals were way too sweet for her        oh  there were a little damage on some of bottles  but luckily  nothing got out      good,1,0
5699,this is very good seed and alot of it   i use itfor growing wheatgrass for juicing   grass actually is greener than the already grown grass i have gotten from the health food store alot of seed,1,0
5700,arrived in the plastic container   just as if you purchased at costco  sell by data is more than 6 months in the future  looks like others did not recieve the plastic container   but i wasn t expecting it anyway if you ve had the nuts from costco  these are literally the same product  everyone in the office loves them  3lb of costco brand chocolate covered almonds,1,0
5772,i have found what i was looking for in a popcorn seasoning  i have been looking for at least three years  i plan to order more soon  found what i been looking for,1,0
5769,if you want to add a bit of zest to your meatloaf  try the lysander s cajun meat loaf mix   the only way the family will eat meat loaf     totally rocks     cajun meatlof mix,1,0
5768,octavia japanese genmaicha  green has always been a favorite of mine   this package had much greener dried tea leaves  took longer to brewand seemed to contain less tea   i transferred the tea to another container and cannot identify the tin it came from  next one i open i will keep the container  good but different this time,1,0
5767,oh my gosh   my church was making green pepper jelly for our christmas bazaar and i was told it would take a lot of food coloring so i ordered a pkg  of 3 16 oz  containers of durkey green liquid food color from amazon   it took such a small amount of color that the only bottle opened was still almost full and we made about 100 jars   we couldn t believe it and kidded that we probably have at least a 50 yr supply   hope it has a long shelf life   lol durkee green food color,1,0
5766,first of all  shipping and packaging went very well  i m impressed in that regard  after reading the previous review  i was kind of expecting to be blown away by the wonderful smell and taste  i m not saying it tastes or smells bad  but it s not as amazing as the other reviewer puts it  the fragrance and taste is hard to describe  but good  i brewed it at a relatively hot temperature for about 6 minutes  and added sugar with it  the tea tastes fruity but with a cinnamon kick to it as well as floral undertones  i would recommend this product to another person  but i don t think i ll be able to use all 16oz of it  buying a smaller bag might be a good idea  worth the money  but nothing to write home about ,1,0
5765,i bought this coffee seeking fall flavors  but unfortunately  it just seemed there wasn t enough in this coffee  but the price for the amount of coffee you get is unbeatable and the flavor it still wonderful  just not as pumpkin y as i would have hoped  plus  it s organic and all that good stuff  not a pumpkin y as i would have hoped  but a great flavour,1,0
5764,i was thrilled to discover that some companies are trying hard to provide the general public with a healthy solution to their sweet tooth   i am trying to avoid any food products that have aspartame or any other sugar free sweetener with the exception of stevia  which my doctor has recommended we use as the alternative to all the others  so my hat s off to you for your diligence and care  thank you i tried the hard candy  sour fruits  licorice  and lemon but was disappointed   i guess my sweet tooth craves something a bit sweeter  the sweets just weren t sweet enough for me  everything arrived to my house in a short time of ordering  the packaging is good quality and well presented  i just didn t care for the candy   i felt there could have been more flavour again  i commend you for providing this alternative to all of us who are trying to live a healthier life eugenie stevia sweetened hard candy,1,0
5773,my dog is doing very well on this food  better than she did on many others including merrick s other brands  foster and smith  and brothers complete  but the recent price increase means i will be shopping elsewhere for this product   not to mention that i almost always had at least one bag in my order come unsealed during shipment due to poor packaging   more than enough reasons to shop elsewhere  great food  but no longer a good value on amazon,1,0
5763,this is really strong chai tea  the leaves smell like a pack of big red and cinnamon cloves are the strongest flavors the resealable bag is pretty sturdy so even if you threw it against the wall your tea would still be safe  not really much else to say besides it s well packaged tea that tastes good  really strong on the cinnamon,1,0
5761,i m sure this is healthy   in some way  i began using this in my morning strawberry and banana smoothie and i could barely taste the over powering grass or alfalfa  i wouldn t recommend in a plain glass of water  i ll give it a month and see what health benefits come from it  tough pill to swallow,1,0
5760,this coffee has a full body and a rich taste  the price is far below the  other  coffee in the k cup and does not use as much plastic  fog chaser coffee,1,0
5759,as my title says  you either will love it or not  i love it  some friends who tried it and didnt like it were disapointed the flavor didnt quite match the aroma  this is one you will have to try for yourselves  love it  or not so much,1,0
5758,you love k cups  but get annoyed with paying  1 50  apiece  this product is for you  it s not a k cup  so my guess is that they don t pay royalties to keurig  and they pass the savings along to you so if it s not a k cup  what is it  too hard to explain  it s like a cross between a tea bag and a k cup here s all that matters  it fits in your keurig machine  no problem  they package it in a way that it stays fresh  and it brews as good of a cup of coffee as any k cup but it s way cheaper try it  you ll love it  the alternative to high priced k cups you ve been looking for ,1,0
5757,i just researched about the korean noodle recall because i love this shin ramyun noodle    the best taste and texture instant noodle i have ever tasted  it is the neoguri seafood   mild noodles and neoguri seafood and spicy noodles that are problematic  not this shin ramyun type by the same company nongshim  read this article      advice  because of high sodium in instant noodles  put only partial seasoning package and also try not to drink the soup  instant noodle with best taste and texture    see recall info,1,0
5753,these were great healthy crackers from costco   but they seemed to have vanished into thin air   it looks like the company changed their formula and packaging  judging from their website    that s a shame when they had such popular  and delicious  product that was available at costco   maybe kirkland should consider a private label of this one     either way  i hope they will bring this one back soon    sadly i can t find this product anymore ,1,0
5752,blackberry tea   vanilla tea   you like it or you don t  i like it because it s decaffeinated and easy on the throat  to me  the pyramids do not pose any steeping advantage but i do like how they don t come individually wrapped  i shudder to think of where all those envelopes went as i discarded them over the years so if you re serious about your tea  by all means  go ahead  i do not love it  but i like it  i do not love it  but i like it ,1,0
5762,first  let me tell you that i didn t buy this coffee from amazon as they couldn t ship it to my default shipping address  i bought one bottle for 6euro from my town market the aroma and taste are fine  however  this is the first organic coffee i try  what i didn t know and it doesn t write it anywhere on it s label is that the amount of caffeine in every organic coffee tea is less than the regular one  so  now daily i need 2 cups of coffee instead of one i used to drink  in past  aroma   taste fine  caffeine less  ,1,0
5750,so  my dog likes it  i ll just get that out there right away but  it s awkward to carry and can be messy  which i didn t think it would be  but since you have to sometimes give it a little encouragement to get anything to come out  sometimes it just decides  oh you want all of it   and i have a sticky snouted puppy and  she has since lost interest in it and prefers treats she can smell better  not sure how to feel,1,0
5774,nifty container  i love nifty things    and my mustache kitty went ape when from the day i wrapped it  all the way until the unveiling come christmas day the only reason i took one star off   the cat needs some  down time  before this becomes exciting again after a few days use about the fifth sixth time i opened the container she would just sniff it  and look at me  like hey  it s your turn now bub  i believe that to be the inherent nature of catnip however  dangerous  cat loved it ,1,0
5776,i m not complaining about this   i think this item is great   but i didn t realize how little i needed when i first used this in my chai tea   hahahaha wow   okay   put a small tea spoon in   even that may be too sweet  very sweet ,1,0
5796,bought these to decorate cupcakes for a kid s halloween party  they are very cute  look like the picture  as advertised  cute ,1,0
5795,this product is very good on all meat products  vegetables and soups   it has just the right amount of pepper i would not pay  9 32 for it when it is available on other websites for under  4 00         this product is great however the price of  9 32 must be a misprint   it is available for around  3 50 on other websites ,1,0
5794,at last a sweetener with hardly any of that nasty aftertaste  there is a very slight aftertaste but not the same as the others    it is acceptable in my opinion   sweetens like sugar  only slightly sweeter  so don t use quite as much   this swerve product is too expensive  which is my only real complaint  which is why i rated 4 stars and not 5  finally ,1,0
5792,it was tasty and fresh  the other one i bought was old and tasted moldy  but this one was good  came as expected,1,0
5791,the tea leaves arrived in perfect condition with clear instructions for use   i ve made and drank two batches of the tea   each makes four 8 oz cups  and i assume all the health giving properties are doing their thing   the tea itself is bland and pretty tasteless   i drink it icy cold and it s like drinking water   no better  no worse   people can add sweetener and drink it hot or warm also  but i just drink it in place of one of my usual water beverages because that is what i prefer   it s a health drink and i can t imagine anyone disliking it  and that s the main thing   you don t have to hold your nose and choke it down   it s fine  hoping it s all it promises to be ,1,0
5790,i have been using this product for many years   it is a great non poisonous method of controlling the insect population in and around your house i could not believe all that i caught   spiders  roaches  earwigs  a poor lizard  more spiders  more bugs     just put them in corners along the baseboard and check them periodically   mine filled up in no time with nasty critters you will not be disappointed with this item if you are looking to catch bugs  you won t believe what you ll catch ,1,0
5788,i ordered these for my silky terrier and he absolutely loves them   however  i see the price has gone up again since i placed my order just last month   i think the seller may be taking advantage of the chinese made jerky treat scare   these are just much  much too expensive   i would not purchase again   a really small bag for a really big price  much  much too expensive  ,1,0
5775,i like the clear scalp because it actually manages to give a bit of the old feel back  without making my hair feel greasy as if i ve left conditioner in it  i ve used this for about a week now  and really like how it makes my hair look and feel  definately worth a try if your trying to avoid that brillo pad head of grey hair like me i used to have to worry about greasy  oily hair back in the day  i searched out shampoos that would dry out the scalp and leave my hair less oily  well a handful of years ago i started to go grey  and when i went grey  i skipped right over the  salt   pepper  look and jumped from a dark brown to bob barker in what seemed almost overnight now  i didn t mind losing my hair color at a young age   at least i still had a full head of hair which is more than i can say for several friends  but what i hated was that the grey hair was of such a different texture and feel from my regular hair  it was coarse  dry and wiry  suddenly shampoos like head and shoulders and pert we too harsh  and my scalp felt brittle  great product,1,0
5787,i m surprised to see so many negative comments about this product  i don t notice any kind of aftertaste nor do i notice this  cooling effect   so far i ve only had this by itself  just to taste it  and in coffee  both experiences were positive  look  it s not really that much money to try it  so if you want to avoid sugar and don t want something like slenda  or stevia    yuck   then why not give nectresse a try  this stuff is great ,1,0
5785,after hearing about the health benefits of dark chocolate i decided to buy some at our local health foods store  i did not buy this on amazon but wanted to comment   i was very surprised by this chocolate  i will admit  at first i was thinking   omg  this tastes nothing like chocolate  but  it s 88  cocoa and since i ve never really had any other dark chocolate except the hershey bar  i didn t really know what to expect  i m not a baker too so give me a break   anyway  this is definitely growing on me  i had my second piece today  i bought the little pkg of 10 individually wrapped squares  it is very good and you definitely should let it melt in your mouth and savor the flavor  like another reviewer stated   like a glass of wine   i will definitely be buying more of this  and for those that say  yuck    it s not your typical candy bar  it s more of a delicacy per say  i was very surprised,1,0
5783,the bag came broken  product was leaking out of the box  due to poor packing standards hope next items arrive unscathed  quinoa tasted good  busted,1,0
5782,this is a wonderful alternative to soda pop   it s carbonated for those like me that just enjoy fizzy drinks way too much for their own good  yet it also contains 70 percent total juice   i m not going to say it should be a substitute to drinking normal fruit juice  but if again you re like me  and both are almost addicted to fizzy drinks and can t stand the taste of any artificial sweetner to even try to gag down a  diet  soda  then this is very much the way to go   i also do suggest this flavor  most or all of the izze line uses some of the flavor of juice listed on the can  but also some grape and or apple juice as a  filler    they do the same here  but it tastes first like clementine or at least orange juice  and then a hint of the others come through   i ve found with most other flavors of izze it will taste more like the  filler  first  and then the flavor listed on the can or bottle price may seem high  but compared to what a 4 pack costs here it s actually not horrid considering   and if one has an amazon prime account  then shipping costs aren t a major issue  wonderful alternative to soda pop,1,0
5781,v8 v fusion may appear to be the typical energy drink that is available today  but the difference between v8 and drinks such as red bull  this drink contains vegetable and fruit and 50 calories   this may be a nice alternative to carbonated sodas or sugary fruit juices because it contains nutritional ingredients that may provide a bit of energy for the day   the drink contains fruity peach mango flavor  green tea  and vitamin b  but also a concentration of potatoes  yellow tomatoes  and carrots with the natural energy that v8 v fusion provides  one may want to switch from the regular cup of coffee or fizzy pop that usually contains the energy for the day   the taste is satisfying  not too sweet  fruity  acidic  or watery   and after trying the 8 fl  oz  can  one may not be enough  however  the contents warn that it may not be recommended for children  women nursing or pregnant  or individuals watching their caffeine in take   but one recommendation  chill the drink before serving  neither too sweet nor fizzy,1,0
5779,i have always heard about vinegar being great for cleaning  i m sure i even used it to clean a microwave before  and i know i ve soaked mildew smelling clothes in vinegar water which was successful  but  it wasn t until i bought a steam mop  here on amazon  and tackled my vinyl kitchen floors  that hadn t been well cleaned in years    that i discovered the magic of vinegar  this steam mop left my floor so tacky and sticky  if i stood in one place  i felt like either the floor or my skin was going to come off  i took to the internet for a solution  someone said to mop the floor with vinegar  skeptical  but desperate  i did one mopping of the vinegar all over the kitchen floor  just like that  as soon as it dried my floor was clean again  extremely excited  i looked up more magic ways vinegar cleans  then i ran out of vinegar  and had to buy some more  i have used it now to clean faux wood blinds that had grease   dust buildup  air return vent that had years of residue   dust build up  and stained toilets  i now keep a generic spray bottle of vinegar for cleaning anything alright  i am a believer now  vinegar is magic  vinegar is magic ,1,0
5778,i first heard about this on america s test kitchen where it won a blind taste test against a premium italian brand and so we tried it  and verified that it was excellent and remains so to this day   but the amazon price is beyond comprehension   18 88 when compared to in store price of  7 49 and on top of that  and for reasons that are totally uncler  the store is marking it down by an additional  3 50 so that the price came out to be  3 99   and to anticipate a quesiton  i checked the  expiration  date and it is off until late 2013   even if there was no discout  the  7 49 regular price is a bargain  at least compared to amazon   and this is good olive oil  the olives are grown and harvested in california with processing on site  excellent but price ,1,0
5777, hand selected premium black teas from asia provide the foundation for this regal blend  but it is the essence of italian bergamot  a fragrant orange  which gives earl grey its flavor and aroma of distinction  there s that word  regal   have you ever met someone who used that word in a sentence  and not as a joke  higgins   burke excites your senses with premium teas that will inspire and revitalize you  indulge   escape  it s earl grey  i steeped it for three minutes and i steeped it for five minutes  i had it plain and with 1 2   1 2  it s still earl grey  don t get me wrong  i like it  but please  tooting your own horn gives me a headache guess i ll go drink more tea now  it s earl grey  man ,1,0
5786,i don t know how they can label these as lentils    lentils  is the third ingredient listed   the first two are water  and tomatoes   having said that  it s a nicely seasoned tomato soup with some lentils in it   just not what i thought i was buying  tasty  but    ,1,0
5749,we purchased these regal walnuts twice before   the last batch was not satisfactory as they were beginning to turn rancid   amazon credited me back  no problem  and i returned the unused portion at their expense with shipping label provided   the replacement shipment was excellent again  like the first   and  this time  the bags have a  freshness use by  date which was not on previous bags   again  they are excellent  regal walnut halves are great,1,0
5746,i did enjoy this product in my hair usually i get too greasy or too watery the product had a nice consistency and the smell was very pleasant yet like with all products like this  it s difficult to get out of the bottle  my fingers get messed up and once you get to the middle it gets even more difficult if someone could design a better way to get the product out that is like this  i would love to buy this product more  nice not too greasy,1,0
5745,i could be wrong but it seems like these used to be better  after reading reviews i think something went down in quality once bigs took over production but with that said  these are still good sunflower seeds and addicting  there was an abundance of seeds that looked like they were smashed together or had gotten a ton of whatever the seasoning was glued onto them in a glob but at least 90  of each package was the normal single seed  non misformed kind  all in all these are worth buying if you like sunflower seeds but if you have had them before bigs was outsourced to produce them you may be a little disappointed as i was as they went from great to good  good but not as good as i remember,1,0
5717,post seems to have discontinued this product much to my disappointment   i really don t care for the other flavors of honey bunches of oats so will no longer be a customer   i simply do not understand why such a good product was shipcanned  delicious product,1,0
5716,i have mixed feelings about this cat litter when my cat first poops  the litter mixes with the smell of the feces and creates a horrid porta potty smell  however  after about 5 minutes  the odor is completely gone  it clumps poop very well  but if you have multiple cats  this litter does what all litter does  makes the  wet sand  consistency at the bottom of the pan  and it smells like ammonia when you scrape it out  get a h super scoop if you are sensitive to perfume  it works the same as double duty  just a bit less feces odor control   get double duty if you would rather smell chemicals for 5 minutes than poop all day this litter also has the tendency to stick to paws  if you get it  keep the box on a non carpet surface so you can easily sweep the granules that your cat may track out overall  good product  just be prepared for a nasty smell for 5 minutes when your cat takes a dump  mixed feelings,1,0

5713,i am so glad that i purchased the sampler pack   my keurig coffee machine is a recent purchase  the sampler pack gave me the opportunity to trial different brands and blends to get an idea of k kup likes and dislikes   none of the coffees were horrible  but i definitely learned which ones i liked and which i really didn t care for   it s a great way learn the ropes of k kupping  it was worth the price  decaf coffe sampler k kups,1,0
5712,i purchased 2 of these jars for use in my garden  i plant many bulbs every fall  but only half of the bulbs survive the onslaught of the squirrels  faced with spending ever increasing amounts of money on more and more bulbs  i decided to fight back  i searched far and wide for a squirrel deterrent that would be organic and non toxic for humans and pets  there was no product on the market that was not accompanied by a page of toxic warnings  i decided to try cayenne pepper after doing some online research i used a lot of this pepper  everywhere in my garden  covering all of the planting surface  i sat back and began to await the oncoming squirrel offensive  they came  but they did not linger  the first squirrel scout appeared  after gingerly tip toeing through a promising patch of ground  she attempted a hole  but immediately left the garden to dig in the grass  i was thrilled  as time has passed  i have observed no new squirrel digging holes in my garden  i may actually see most of my prized tulips in the spring  hooray for cayenne pepper this product is the best price quantity value that i could find  try this for your garden  it works  happy gardener ,1,0
5711,we went on the dukan diet and began using stevia   we  muscle test  most of the products we eat  and this is the only one that seems to give a positive muscle test   i can barely taste the difference from sugar   not true with other stevia products i ve tried   this is the only one i ll buy  this one works ,1,0
5719,i never buy flavored coffee   i m a cream  sugar and drizzle of caramel sauce type of coffee drinker   when i read the reviews about this toffee flavored coffee i decided to try it with high hopes as the coffee was brewing into the mug  i smelled a slight toffee scent   it  and the coffee smelled good   my hubs wanted a cup  just black   i brought him his and after he drank some  while i was brewing mine  i asked him how he liked the flavor    what flavor   he asked    it tastes like coffee to me  he said   more questions to him and he said all he tasted was coffee  no flavor and the coffee was ok now for my cup   i used about 1 inch of milk  one spoon of sugar and the keurig on medium brewing setting   the same faint scent of toffee was there along with the coffee   i took my first sip and hardly tasted any toffee flavor   i looked at the k cup and it said  toffee  on it so it was the correct k cups that were sent   it is such a mild  almost non existent flavor that i wouldn t hesitate to serve this to those who don t like flavored coffee  i m sure they would like it   i m disappointed in the weak flavor of toffee but the coffee itself is good tasting so it s not a waste   i m used to extra bold  dark french roasts so this is a much lighter roast for me   all in all i like it  not what i expected,1,0

5709,after reviewing the other reviews i took a chance and ordered this directly from amazon i am also not a fan of decaf and was worried about how many decafs i would receive in my order only 2 of the 35 were decaf so as the title states i got the luck of the draw  the rest were all coffee and only four were labeled  iced coffee  versus coffee or cappuccino it gave me a nice variety in an easy to open cardboard box  it gives me a nice variety of two of each item with the exception of  island coconut  where i received three of them which is ok the box has an expiration date of 12 21 2012 which is fine as i ll easily drink 35 cups between now and then i hope others have the same luck  lucky draw,1,0
5720,yes  orgain changed their formula recently  among other things  it no longer contains soy  which i think is a good thing since it can be an allergen and can cause digestive discomfort  gas  bloating  in some cases  unfortunately  with this change  apparently some bad batches made it out into the market  mine were dated 8 21 and 8 22   these batches have a weird and very strong  grassy  flavor that is indeed quite disgusting  which i think i ve tasted before from some organic milk from grass fed cows  however  if you receive these batches  please try contacting them with your concerns before jumping to conclusions  i sent them a private message on facebook         with the codes on top of my drinks  and they quickly responded  sending me free replacement cases the replacements tasted just like the formula before the change  as far as i could tell  they know there s a problem  and are working to resolve it  customer service still exists in the internet age of automation  orgain is still great  just beware of bad batches,1,0
5721,i wasn t too impressed with this previously but sweetleaf must have reformulated along with the new labels because it is really good now  you get a lot of raspberry flavor with just a few drops  new formula is deliscious ,1,0
5722,i recently picked a bushel of jonagold at a local orchard  and was asked to bring an apple dessert for 14  i had found this mix at the market but still wanted to check my cookbooks for a traditional crisp recipe  no luck   maybe this type of dessert is too old fashioned   so i decided to give the mix a go  for texture i added chopped crystallized ginger and a half cup of granola  one with mostly cereal grains  and a bit of flour and brown sugar  the taste was ideal and i can t wait to get more  on the  hit  list ,1,0
5744,these triangle tea bags are small  so i thought they might make a weak herb tea   but it s quite pleasant in flavor  not weak  not overpowering   my taste buds first picked up the blackberry  with a candy like flavor  followed by the vanilla   best flavor is experienced when the tea is allowed to cool 5 minutes before consumption   i do not find a sweetener necessary in this tea  nice flavor  pleasant tea,1,0
5743,i hope they never stop making these coco mints  or their licorice mints   i use xylitol gum and candies a lot  and i get awfully tired of the choices of cinnamon fruit mint fruit cinnamon fruit mint fruit cinnamon      offered elsewhere   i like the fact that these are made of simple real ingredients  xylitol  cocoa powder  and peppermint oil   the fact that they crumble a bit never bothered me   when i finish off a tin  i dump the sugar at the bottom into my coffee  hope they never stop making these ,1,0
5742,these are decent bags with an easy tear off strip  they hold the contents well and basically do the job they are intended for  i guess the bright colors makes them a bit more exciting  bags on board waste pickup bags,1,0

5737,my 7 cats like this food but it is a little yucky for the human  pieces of mackerel swimming in a dark broth  it is billed as a  complete  food and contains carrots  peas and pasta  why  i don t know  since these are not foods that a cat would eat in the wild  an ok alternative to go along with their dry food  the cats like it,1,0
5736,didn t buy these here  but they are the best   company certifies gluten free and kosher  it would be really nice if that information were available on amazon  but it s not   i got it from the company   i believe they also are made in a facility that doesn t process nuts  but you d have to check that on the company web site   search for the company website for allergen info  also guten free and kosher,1,0
5735,i have read the reviews and noticed some complaints of coffee ground residual left after brewing  i have tried all of the blends and i have not had a single problem my kuerig is over a year old and i can honestly say this coffee is very good and a reasonable price i was so thrilled when the new hazelnut flavor came out and it is very flavor filled and  no unpleasant aftertaste  i give it a solid 4 as the only way it would get a 5 is if i brewed a whole pot and i can t with my k cupsbuy    you will not be sorry no coffe ground in my cup,1,0
5733,i bought this since i read about the more than positive reviews  my husband and 5 yr old take this daily as a shake added to our oatmeal and although we have not seen a change in our energy level  we seen a lot of movement in the bathroom arena  i gave it a 4 because i have not seen any energy change yet  which is really why i bought it  if our energy level explodes then i will change my rating  good product    no energy boost yet,1,0

5731,i convinced my sister to stop feeding her dog purina beneful original dog food  15 5 pound  after reading the ingredients in it   she tried this one next   it had a much better ingredients list  but her dog did not like it   i believe because her dog is use to eating chicken or lamb   the beneful was the only beef dog food he had eaten in a long time  and there was so little beef  he probably didn t even taste it  i told her there was chef michael s oven roasted chicken dry dog food 11 5 pound bag  but she instead let her husband choose the next bag of food  he bought something very expensive that had new zealand lamb as the number one ingredient  and had absolutely no corn  the dog loves it  better than beneful        ,1,0
5730,i was looking for a snack that was high in protein but low in fat so i started looking at beef jerky  but all the other brands have at least some sort of fat in them  usually a minimum of 1g  which may not sound like much  but when you re dieting  every gram counts  so when i found this brand i was very pleased  it tastes great and did i mention it has zero fat  oh yeah  i did  but each service  28 oz  only has 50 calories  no carbs and some good protein  switch to this brand style  you won t be displeased  tastes great  completely fat free ,1,0
5729,i can eat these sunflower seeds and not get an irritated mouth  as i do get when i eat david s sunflower seeds   these are not as salty as david s sunflower seeds in my opinion   i ve gotten two orders of these and both packages have been fresh  with not too many bad seeds in the packages   also  the price is just about  1 50 per pound  which is great  especially for jumbo sized seeds   given the choice  i cannot imagine opting to buy another brand of sunflower seeds as long as the price and quality of jumbo brand sunflower remains consistent   also  i will never again buy anything but the jumbo sized seeds   after eating the larger seeds  i cannot imagine wasting my time eating those annoying little seeds which david sells in their regular sized seeds  way better than david s   a great price ,1,0

5726,the taste of aloe gloe is excellent   there is however a little bit of stevia aftertaste  not too bad  like many expensive waters the amount of the healthy ingredients isn t much   the bottle indicates 300 mg of aloe   i m assuming that is for the entire bottle not   this is actually a reasonable dosage but perhaps a bit on the low side depending on how much benefit you expect to obtain  and who s opinion on dosage you listen to  this is a good low calorie drink  only 35 calories for the entire bottle  and an entire bottle is only 8 grams of sugar all in all this seems like a good product but due to the cost i doubt i ll drink much  i d rather buy coconut water  excellent taste  moderate potency,1,0
5723,my son has soy and milk alleregy issues and had a minor reaction after eating a bag of these chips   it happens every so often when he eats something marked with   34 made in a facility that processes soy or milk  34  so i don t blame popchips but he loved them so much i wish they had thier own production facility  fantastic chips but caused food alleregy issues,1,0
5602,i have been drinking this coconut water since 2 years and so far  i do not have any claim  i hope always getting the same quality  because when you say a product is good suddenly change to a low quality  i don t know why this happen  anyway   i like it the flavor and natural features of this coco water   good product       ,1,0

5470,i was addicted to diet coke but began experiencing ill effects from the aspartame  i gave up all artificial sweeteners and was thrilled when i found a soda sweetened with stevia  i was so excited to receive the shipment  however when i took that first sip of zevia i thought it tasted terrible and my husband wasn t very pleased with it either  not wanting to pour  18 down the drain we decided to finish it off but had no intention of purchasing any more  well obviously zevia is something your taste buds need to adjust to over time  yesterday i opened my fifth can and wow  it actually tasted really good  i wondered whether the good taste was just a fluke possibly related to the flavor of the grilled chicken salad i was eating  well  i opened my sixth can a few minutes ago and was wowed again  it tastes even better today  my husband had the same reaction and actually said he thinks it tastes better than diet coke now  i just ordered two more cases  if you are trying zevia for the first time and don t like the taste  don t throw it out  give yourself a few days to adjust to the flavor  you just might grow to love it  this review is for the cola flavor  give it a chance  it takes a few cans,1,0

5467,this was a fun assortment of coffees  if you re looking for an assortment of all the different things you can have in a keurig you re going to be disappointed  there were two ciders  two hot cocoas and one tea  the rest were coffees  both flavored and not  i liked the ability to try all sorts of coffee and was suprised at what i ended up liking best  now i can go out and spend money on one brand  knowing what i liked best  on the con side  there were only 34 k cups and two of them were stale  so when you put them in barely anything came out and then it clogged the keuirg  but overall it was a good buy  it did come in a brown paper bag  but that didnt bother me either  good selection of coffee,1,0

5456,i really like this very delicious cocoa  no question about it   that s why i gave the product itself five stars   but   a bullet on the product description page states   specially designed packet to be used with any keurig machine  and the rest of the description and other comments emphasize some intrinsic keurig connection   that is misleading   the only connection with keurig machines  or their k cups  is that keurig packs sample packets in with their brewing machines   this product is simply a box of single packets that each create one 8 ounce cup of not overly sweet cocoa from any hot water source  tea kettle  microwaved mug of water  etc     milk is not necessary  as milk solids are some of the ingredients as for amazon s  20 price  i buy the same box of packets at smart   final stores  a west coast chain  for under  10  great cocoa  keurig machine unnecessary  cheaper elsewhere,1,0
5455,i was trying to supplement with formula because my baby was not gaining weight  unfortunately he rejected the bottle formula for 3 months even though i tried many different brands  other brands i tried would make him gag at the taste and i felt so bad giving it to  him  i saw good reviews for gerber good start even though there weren t as many reviews  but i went for it because there wasn t much to lose  not only did he take the bottle  he took the formula  i was so relieved  i don t know if it was just coincidence that he was ready to take the bottle  but either way gerber good start saved me  he is not gaining weight and looks forward to his bottles  amazing  life saver ,1,0

5460,i like chunk light tuna better than albacore for most things  sometimes things get dented in shipping  we all know mass shipping is not always kind to products  and if they know it s not breakable like glassware  they are not careful  anyway  i saw other reviews where people were afraid to eat dented cans  and i had to say something  this is misinformation  it is bulging cans and or cans with rusty looking seams that you are not supposed to eat  if it looks like the shipping container got wet  just clean the cans first  as you would do after a flood  i am a health inspector in california  most people don t know that it is not even illegal to sell products past the out date  at least in this state  those dates are a guideline and we even license stores called food salvagers that sell primarily expired goods at a steep discount  now i wouldn t necessarily eat expired dairy products  except yogurt with live cultures  and some bottled juices will separate after a very long time  way past the out date   and the main problem with that is texture  meat  maybe  depends on how it looks and if it s been frozen  but packaged goods are mostly good for a long time after that date  if it smells rancid or stale  then don t eat it  oddly enough  saltine crackers are one item that gets really rancid eventually  and i m talking a long time after the listed date  i get mad when i see grocery store personnel dumping wagon loads of food in dumpsters that are past the out date when they could be donating them to people in need  but anyway  a can that is dented from shipping is no reason to not eat something  what a waste  dented cans are not dangerous or bad,1,0
5451,having tried these during a trip to europe 2 years ago  my kids and i love popping one of these in our mouths while watching tv or doing their homework   made of real sugar and fruit juices   this is not for anyone looking for a healthy snack  lol  but it certainly better tasting than the traditional fructose corn syrup  yes  made from corn    candy one other reason why i am writing this review is to caution folks that the latest order directly from amazon had an expiration date of feb 2012   called amazon who quickly took care of this for me   another earlier similar order from another amazon seller this month had an expiration date of oct 2012 which is a little more acceptable than feb 2012  let s see whether my kids and i can finish 12 of these rolls  2 were gone the first day  within a reasonable time without going way past the oct 2012 date wish there was a way to check the expiration date before ordering oct 22nd update amazon reshipped the same item and it was delivered with the same feb 2012 expiration date   called customer service and i accepted their offer for a refund  be aware this item comes directly from amazon   amazon is suppose to pull this listing until they are able to investigate it  addictive  high quality  tasty candy,1,0

5493,the 3 flavors of this candy  mandarin  orange and lemon  all taste so realistic as to be completely unexpected  the mandarin is so realistic that there is no other candy that even comes close in acurate flavor in my opinion  at first i thought   oh  i ll get bored with only 3 flavors  but i don t think that anymore  and the lemon which i thought would be something that i would have to sort of suffer through  i mean  come on  lemon  but it is my favorite of the 3 flavors  it is expensive but i personally don t think there is anything comparable in the market today  how all citrus candy should taste,1,0
5492,i used these for the candy buffet i had at my wedding and i must say these were literally bursting with orange flavor  i usually find gum balls to be pretty bland no matter the flavor  these were very hard to me and hurt my teeth a little bit  so it lost a star  but i would recommend them based on the flavor alone  they looked great for the autumn themed candy buffet we had going on  a little hard for my taste  but the orange flavor was great,1,0

5482,one cat likes it  one cat doesn t   in fairness  the one that doesn t like it is not a big fan of canned food in general and  well  we all know about cats and finickiness the ingredients here are excellent  and if you couldn t read the label  your nose would tell you   instead of a cat food stench  it smells like you popped the top on a can of chicken while it is significantly more expensive than many brands  compare ingredients   cats are obligate carnivores who must have meat  and meat is more expensive than soy  grain  starches  and nebulous by products   additionally  i checked the label of a well known brand name canned cat food and found titanium dioxide  which is essentially a white pigment  and currently classified as  possibly carcinogenic   i e   cancer causing  and caramel color   who s that for   pretty sure my cat doesn t care what color the food is i would consider this a very high quality food and a good choice   the missing star represents the vote of the picky cat who won t eat it  50 50,1,0

5478,i purchased two packages of these twist chews  they arrived quickly and were exactly what i wanted  but both packages had ants in them  after knocking off all  hopefully  the ants  i repacked the chews in plastic bags and stored them in the freezer to kill any critters i missed  the dogs ate them over time and had no bad effects  so i don t think the product was unsafe  it was just a creepy experience  good product  but had ants,1,0
5477,my husband and i purchased a bottle of this in playa del carman on our honeymoon  we know we won t be back there for many  i was very disappointed to see the last drop come out of my bottle  that is when i decided to do a google search and found this on amazon   quick delivery  sealed product  couldn t be happier  i have already used it twice  wonderful flavor ,1,0
5476,not really  but i guess in principle i m in favor of fair trade stuff so what the heck   i m not a honey connoisseur by any stretch of the imagination  but i thought this tasted good  i mostly eat honey on toast or use it when i make my own salad dressing my wife thought this had a slightly  off  flavor  she felt it tasted like molasses  actually  compared to the regular honey we buy at the supermarket  but i did not notice that  you can taste the fairness   ,1,0
5485,on a nostalgic whim  i wanted to see if my favorite lollipops from my childhood in the mid 70 s were on amazon   the answer was  of course they are   unfortunately they re not quite as i remembered  in look or taste   not as much sour to contrast with the sweet  which was was the main thing i really liked about them  hey  i was a weird kid    granted my tastebuds were much younger and more sensitive then  so maybe it s just me   different packaging  too   i remember an opaque  colorful  square wrapper that was just  twisted  on  instead of the clear  sealed  somewhat less tamper proof plastic   in fact i have a heck of a time opening them  but at least i won t be inhaling the whole box anytime soon   sadly  the wrapper may just be a sign of the times  all in all it s still a good product but i probably wouldn t buy this again  i was feeling nostalgic,1,0
5495,followed directions  falafel mix 1 cup add 1 2 cup water  falafel 1 box 10 oz   add 1cup of water  so you would think the total mix in the box is 2 cups  correct  no  i found that there is a little more left it is wonderful surprise i like the flaver  the texture is little rough made it little difficult to form the patties or the balls  surpriseindeed,1,0
5450,this is good stuff  i m quite surprised that it doesn t taste woody or have any artificial taste issues whatsoever  it tastes just as its advertised   like peanut butter  and to top it off  its low cal and low fat which is why i m buying more of it  try it  you won t be disappointed  a great quality product ,1,0
5447,the smell is not like anything from the store smells clean and somewhat like freshly cut grass  i don t know if that makes it healthier to use  but it just seems like it is   if you drink it you can taste  nothing but when you swallow it  it has a mild burn  with zero after taste  i use too much of this stuff when i cook because i marinate things in it then dump more on my food  i also use it on my skin if you can t drink it you shouldn t put it on your body the skin is the most important part of your body  i give this oil a ten out of ten two thumbs up  fine smell that makes me want use in all my cooking,1,0

5420,in august i placed an order for dog food  royal canin dry dog food  and paid  31 29   i am ready to place another order but the price increased to  44 84  which is quite a large increase   i am not sure this is an error in the pricing  but at this price it is cheaper to purchase the item locally  high increase in price ,1,0
5419,first  go to this website       look for the rating section  and find the food that you are feeding your dog or cat right now   they have a cat food link   look for the ratings  and see what your food is rated  then go up to the next rating  and see if you can find a better quality brand  for about the same price  this is exactly how i found a better rated brand   do the research  and see what you can do to  get your pet the best possible rating  that you can afford  keep in mind too  that with less fillers  your dog will get more use out of the food  and it actually goes further than the cheap foods  the doggie waste is also much less in the yard  and   lets just say that he has a much smaller problem with room clearing gas problems  when eating a premium food this brand is one of the few that gets a five star rating on         this website has proved to be indispensable for help in picking out a decent food for our dogs  but nothing is fool proof  when it comes to how that food is produced  and that is the fault of the government not having enough oversight over what can be put into the food  it is sad  because our pets deserve better  after using a  premium brand  food brand iams  for year  i was very sad to learn how terrible the food actually was is for the high price  again   you don t have to purchase this brand  but get the best food for the money that you can afford for them  having a website like amazon  is actually the most helpful because just about every brand mentioned on the dog food site  can be purchased and delivered to your door   something for me that is well worth  not having to lug around that huge bag yes it   this brand   is expensive  however  in light of all of the salmonella outbreaks happening to even the best of dog food companies   like buffalo   i chose this company  because they have not had a recall on their products  that i could track down  i was using premium plus  another expensive brand  but they have had a few recalls  for unclean factories and fungal tainted batches   if you are like us  your pets are no less important to you  than your children  truthfully  unless we hand cook everything for our dogs  we have no control over the way the food is made  or what goes into it  sadly  there is also no oversight  as to what they are allowed to put into that food  this often includes any and all scraps and pieces of whatever  animal product   that will be the base protein  being used for that type of food   any of these scraps qualifies for  meat   because of the recalls on so many brands  i still keep a watchful eye on the company  and hope that they keep up their standards for a clean facility  on a regular basis  to try and keep up with the quality and safety of his food  to the best of my ability  better to be safe than sorry with a sick pup  or worse yet losing him to a food born illness caused by tainted food be warned though  if you have a very large breed dog  the kibble size on this brand  is extremely small  we have since put his food into a  kong feeder  that he has to roll around  to get the food out  which forces him to  take his time in eating it  if we didn t do this  he would totally gulp down an entire bowl  within minutes  often getting sick  because it was not chewed up at all  well worth the extra money,1,0
5418,i m a huge fan of the pumpkin spice coffee that s being sold at starbucks   it gets expensive  my bestfriend told me that coffee mate was selling this so i gave it a try   i m very impressed by the quality and taste  the only down side is 5 grams of sugar for 1 tablespoon   i recommend to any one reading this to buy it but go easy on the teaspoons  wish it wasn t seasonal,1,0
5417,i am not a big fan of sugared drinks and i always try to consume sugar free liquids  red bull regular is a taste i do not like so i take the sugar free kind  this is better to mix with vodka too since you don t need more sugar with alcohol  decent taste for sugar free,1,0

5412,the bully stick wrapped around the bone is probably a standard size  which  for people who don t know bully sticks as well as i wish i didn t  is less than 1 inch thick  but usually bigger than 1 2 inch   my dog is a heavy chewer  she has not met a bully  a bone  a pen  a tissue  a piece of wood she doesn t like to chew   i think that it takes her a little longer to get through this bully stick than a normal straight  12  stick because it is more of a puzzle   the bone adds a little bit of a challenge she doesn t spend a lot of time chewing on the bone   i think it must be frustrating because she can t get anywhere   instead of throwing it out  i stuff it with peanut butter and a little kibble and put it in the freezer   i think of it as a  bone kong  even though that sounds gross   anyway  i give it to her as a treat and she loves to dig for the peanut butter the bully bone is approx  3 5  long and 1 5  wide at it s widest point   my dog is a 50lb pittie mix and she chews on it without a danger of swallowing it   if i had a bigger dog  i might steer clear of this treat   for small and medium sized dogs  this  3  treat is worth it  3 in 1 bully wrapped bone,1,0
5410,well  we were immediately drawn to these  since they have a caramel apple flavor we ordered them from amazon  and quite frankly  a lot of the small bars arrived a bitmushed  we put them in the refrigerator to firm them back up  but that wasn t the problem i m not sure if it was from the cat toy  something for them to rub their faces on  in the sameshipment box could have done the smushing  or if they were improperly stored at the warehouse level we haven t found any that didn t have the actual bar cracked  making the caramel stick to the paper that being said  i love regular milky ways  so didn t think this could be too horrible it isn t  but  it also wasn t worth the price we paid for them i have included a photo of the inside the taste is pleasant  for sure  i think it was the relative cost to candy ratio and the condition in whichthey arrived which was annoying for me  the caramel is just like a regular milky way and tasty the apple part is the bottom nougat   it is a white shade  and tastes like a candy apple more than acaramel apple  so  you have a candy apple bottom with the caramel on the top again  good  but nothing to do a city wide search to find  these are good  but nothing to faint over,1,0

5407,while heating up some oil to fry some vegetables and an egg on  i threw about a tablespoon of this sauce into the frying pan for seasoning  i had used about 1 3 of the bottle so i knew what i was getting myself into  i must have not realized that the oil was too hot to add liquid to without causing it to vaporize  instantly after pouring it in it began to boil violently  a sizeable cloud of dave s hot sauce quickly formed above the pan  i thought it would be ok at first  i backed off after getting a small whiff of it  it was very potent  like mace  after about 25 seconds i couldn t stop coughing but i continued cooking thinking that just the small whiff had gotten into the wrong place in my throat and i would soon return to normal  little did i know that it s vapors were spreading throughout the house  within minutes my roommates were coughing across the house  my dog was also wheezing after opening all the windows and doors in the house and turning some fans on i ate my egg vegetable patty sandwich  even with no visible signs of dave s hot sauce left in the pan it was still very hot  to my liking this sauce should be used with caution  when consumed the wrong way it is very unpleasant  sauce not meant to be inhaled,1,0
5406,i was looking for a delicious  yet healthful vegan vegetable broth powder and came across this brand   i did my research online and almost every site had favorable reviews for this product   reading some of the other reviews for other brands   cough  vogue      i found them suspicious  always need to be careful with reviews  since companies hire people to write positive reviews    i was torn between buying this product or rapunzel    i was not familiar with this brand  but was familiar with rapunzel because i bought it in the past at a local whole foods and thought it was adequate but did not like the fact that the cubes contained so much palm oil  took forever for a cube to dissolve into boiling water    i am in no means a crunchy granola vegan and think that i am pretty discerning when it comes to taste i followed the directions of this product and dissolved 1 teaspoon into 1 cup boiling water  pros  the result was a fine tasting broth    some of the yeast extract did not fully dissolve into the solution  i stirred quite a bit  but the broth was good nonetheless    surprisingly  the broth was not as salty as i thought   additionally  you can see all the bits and pieces of the herbs that this product contains  cons  the container is a bit flimsy   it was hard to pull off the inner aluminum foil   if not careful you will have vegetable powder all over yourself   this may be trivial  but the packaging is very outdated   it s 2012 and the company can surely hire a graphic designer that can produce better packaging design than what they have now   while i was researching  it seemed as though a fair amount of people make their own vegan vegetable powder   almost all recipes use nutritional yeast as its base  but differ on the rest of the ingredients  for instance  once used powder versions of many ingredients  while another recipe basically took whole vegetables chopped up  cubed  and dehydrated and food processed into powder form  i prefer powder broth over cubes   it s a lot more convenient  and you have better control and adjust the strength of your broth   with this said  the broth does in some way feel like it is missing something     i might purchase the rapunzel powder to see how good that product is   i predict that i might get tired of this broth  considering amazon sells it to you in a pack of 6  it isn t a bad idea to have a back up brand to change up the flavor   the rapunzel powder however has more salt  and seems to have less vegetable ingredients  i like the fact that this brand has a lot of vegetable ingredients  and some that are not common in the u s   like lovage    what rapunzel has going for it is that it is organic  while this is just  all natural   which is fine  buy all your vegan broth products on amazon   you will get an amazing price   i can t find any of these products at a normal supermarket  and whole foods charges an arm and a leg for these things   even with many new trader joe s that just opened up in nyc giving whole foods competition and a run for its money  tj just doesn t have the wide variety of niche products that whole foods has update     this product tastes better than the rapunzel vegetable broth powder  i have both    using the recommended directions for both products  seitenbacher has a deeper  more complex flavor whereas rapunzel s tastes very salty  salt is the  1 ingredient in rapunzel    if you want flavor  go for seitenbacher   if you are obsessed about everything being organic  then go for rapunzel  surprisingly satisfying ,1,0

5445,i bought this item for an occasional treat but still have to find the right setting use to make it have that perfect flavor  the largest  travel mug  setting leaves the coffee too weak and the smallest  coffee cup  setting is too much and even the middle size isn t  just right  and sort of tastes like a  lite  cappaccino  i never thought i was hard to please but it seems like this has proven me wrong the price is pretty good so i can t complain on that note  but i guess i m going to continue to drink this item and let it grow on me  as a now and then cup of cappaccino it s ok the 4 star rating is for the price and convenience of not traveling miles to get a cappaccino  not as good as starbucks  but better price,1,0
5444,somehow i purchased this very high quality organic miso paste under the assumption that i was buying white miso   this is red miso   i am honestly not as fond of red miso  and i would not have bought this had i realized i was ordering the red   that being said  it is obviously a fantastic product  and it does have a lot of flavor   unless you eat miso soup every day  i think the three pack will last people a long time   and  truly  i just bumped this up from a three star to a four star review because i don t want other people who do prefer red miso to be turned off by a bad rating  when indeed this is a fine product   but i really want to just give it three stars   it s okay   because i honestly don t like red miso as much  i wanted white miso instead  and i m disappointed i made the mistake of buying red   so i guess you could say i took away a star because i don t think it s very clear on the package exactly what type of miso you re getting when you order this product  the rating is for the type of miso  not the quality,1,0

5437,this tea was different than i expected  but not due to any kind of misrepresentation  in the past i had purchased my kukicha tea from adagio teas  their kukicha is not roasted  and the color of the tea is a mixture of green and blonde  perhaps it s not a true kukicha  but i really enjoyed it  the davidson s tea has a dark brown roasted color and consists of fairly small twigs  i admit to being a bit disappointed initially since i have not enjoyed roasted teas in the past  ugh  i thought  now i have a huge one pound bag to get through  once i made the first cup  i was pleasantly surprised  the roasted flavor is  to me  more subdued than the dark color would suggest  still prominent  but not overpowering  i ve had at least 25 cups so far and i m not at all tired of the flavor  i also appreciate that it is easy to clean up  some teas cling to the brew basket as they dry  but these  twigs  drop right out  given the price  i m pretty satisfied  different than expected  but enjoyable,1,0

5564,i m a popcorn fiend  maybe too much for my own good   but after a great deal of trial and error  this is the only popcorn we buy   it offers the best value for the money    the kernels pop up light and fluffy and the cost is a whole lot less than what you might pay in the store for even the worst supermarket popcorn   the only popcorn that beats the paragon is orville redenbachers  but i refuse to pay the outrageous price when this stuff is close enough   so  i gave the paragon 4 stars only because orville s is a little better  but if looking strictly at value it s a 5 star deal  the only popcorn we buy ,1,0
5562,i tried this a number of years ago and did not like it  i don t know if my tastes have changed over the years or it has been reformulated but i started using it again about 3 years ago and have been using it ever since on a regular basis  i get it at a local grocery store  the last time i think it was about  4 a bottle  i probably use a bottle every couple of months the texture takes some getting used to  i suspect it is hard to get the typical ketchup texture without using a lot of sugar and actual tomatoes  but they are full of carbs so you can t use much in a product like this i emailed them and asked  they told me all their products are about 4 calories per serving and 0 3 to 0 4 grams of carbs per serving  so it just sneaks under the fda guideline for labeling it as zero carbs and zero calories one you get past the texture  the taste is not too far off  i give it 4 stars as a low carb ketchup substitute  it does not stand up well though against regular sugar laden ketchups  including the low sugar ketchup that really isn t all that low in sugar   not bad as a low carb ketchup,1,0
5561,after reading about pu erh  and then tasting several kinds  i ve decided i like the ripe teas better  but i m open to new pathways  so i decided to get this one and stash it for a couple of years to experience the aging process for myself  it s a small cake  so storage shouldn t be too difficult  and it s a minimal investment   so i m not out for much of a loss if i m not too impressed when i do break it open  from the tasty description  i may have to get another to baseline the taste  stashing this cake for later,1,0

5556,in the past  the donut house k cups have been of the highest quality   would have been rated 5 stars  however  even tho the quality of the product is still there  the last time i received the 80 pack  several of the k cups were broken   the coffee missing  some of them were broken within the box   the coffee was everywhere  that is the reason for the 4 star rating   will order them once more to see if the last order was an anomaly  donut house k cups,1,0

5563,though london fruit and herb company s blueberry bliss tea is one of the best teas i have ever had i cannot understand why amazon has not begun shipping it out to customers who ordered this item months ago  it is now available through other vendors  i e  wendell tea company in ma  but not at the amazon price   if is s available to them it should be available to amazon or they should take it off their inventory as an offering london fruit   herb company blueberry bliss tea  20 count  pack of 6  missing in action,1,0

5576,as a gluten intolerant person  i loved it when i found annie s macaroni and cheese  which i always made with lactose free milk because i m also lactose intolerant  found it creamy and yummy and healthier  but otherwise much like those other mac n cheese box dinners i ate as a child   for some reason  the cheese in angie s original gluten intolerant mac n cheese didn t bother me    hard cheeses generally don t bother my lactose intolerance   always safe with parmesan  swiss  aged cheddar  but cream cheese  marscapone  brie  etc   are trouble    unfortunately  this creamy deluxe max dinner triggered my lactose intolerance   tried it twice  thinking the first time must have been a fluke  but it wasn t   something to think about if you are both gluten and lactose intolerance   i m back to angie s original mac n cheese and not feeling like i m missing out at all  beware lactose intolerant individuals ,1,0
5578,tried this coffee shortly after getting my keurig brewer   mainly because i hoped it would taste just like blueberries   while of course it didn t  taste totally of blueberries  i was definitely not disappointed   first cup i brewed  my kitchen smelled so good    couldn t wait to taste it i am one who normally likes  a little coffee with my creamer    not with this coffee   the blueberry taste is not overpowering but i find that i don t need to use as much creamer as with other coffees bottom line if you like the taste of blueberry in your coffee  you ll love it   and have never totally disliked any green mountain coffee   to me it s a a good coffee at a reasonable price   and blueberry is the best   favorite coffee flavor no doubt ,1,0
5596,i had to write something here after reading all of bad reviews  these are obviously reviews from people who s tastebuds have been ruined in regards to what tea is actually supposed to taste like  i can see how this stuff would taste bad if you are used to the majority of tea drinks out there  which are ridiculously high in sugar and added flavor  even the  healthy  and  natural  varieties i was very pleased when i found this tea because it s the only bottled variety i ve found that tastes like the green tea i m served when i eat at a japanese restaurant  it s very refreshing and if your tastebuds arent totally ruined then you ll find it has a very distinct and pleasant leafy flavor  it tastes like  you know  tea leaves  awesome tea  don t listen to the haters ,1,0

5593,the good news is that it is dark and relatively full bodied   it was certainly better than the eight o clock coffee 100  colombian 96 k cups that i tried before this cup for twenty years  eight o clock colombian  ground fresh at a p  was the only coffee we drank   so i ordered both it and the dark italian just as soon as they became available   either my tastes have changed or the coffee has changed but i found the colombia version weak and lacking in character the eight o clock italian roast  however  was stout enough and should be to most people s liking   i brewed it at the 7 oz  middle button  size and tried it without cream and then with a single squirt of coffee creamer   it was strong enough to not let the cream taste dominate the bad news is that it does not come up to the standard of either barista prima coffeehouse  italian roast  24  count k cup portion pack for keurig brewers or timothy s world coffee rainforest espresso k cup  48 count   good news and bad news,1,0

5589,the product is as advertised and the quality is un compromised   the only issue i had was not knowing that by saying  sweet li hing mui  i was really getting something with virtually no saltiness to it   they fine  just not what i was looking for   i gave it 4 stars because there s nothing wrong with it  it s just that i  like others have commented  wanted something a bit more salty than these  sweet indeed,1,0
5577,i had decided packaged oatmeal was a disappointing mush   umpqua oats won me over   always warm and hearty  with just the right amounts of sweet  salty  and whole oats   mostly sunny and kick start are my two favorites  but i ordered the 12 variety pack to change it up a bit  and was not disappointed  my favorite breakfast,1,0
5588,pink grapefruit juice is one of my favorites  unfortunately the bottles were not packaged well  could not pour without spilling because the top of the bottles were misshapen  i guess something heavy was put on top of them  delicious  but top of bottles came crushed,1,0
5586,other reviewers are right and wrong right the packaging sucks  all 3 of my little tubs came flattened and semi crushed  luckily they had a thin plastic seal under the lid or i would have had a slimy mess  surely you guys could pack this better  right the product is almost tasteless and looks like old crisco wrong to some about the taste on the corn  i thought it was delicious  it woke up each salty nugget and helped them to slide right down  by itself no taste  in concert with the corn  perfect  tasted just like theater butter to me  i did get a feeling of major vessels closing down a little with each bite  i was tinged blue and short of breath when i finished  but what do you expect it s fat poured over salty corn  it is supposed to kill you anyway i ll be ordering more     after my bypass     the real story,1,0
5585,i recently purchased a keurig machine and wasn t cure what kind of k cups i should get i didn t want to commit to a large box of one flavor becausea  i like variety and b  what if i didn t like the flavor so  despite many awful reviews  i decided to take a risk and order this project and like the title says  i was pleasantly surprised the product came in a rectangular box  not the paper bag many reviewers were offended by  and the k cups were nicely organized inside i received a wide variety of k cups from different companies  while many of them were vanilla or caramel  even those came in a variety of blends and companies also included were several cappuccino k cups  which i didn t even know existed additionally  considering it was fall  i received two pumpkin spice k cups   yum 2 brooklyn maple sleigh2 brooklyn hazelnut2 brooklyn vanilla skyline1 green mountain mocha nut fudge1 green mountain wild mountain blueberry2 green mountain island coconut   limited edition1 green mountain french vanilla decaf1 green mountain french vanilla1 green mountain hazelnut decaf1 green mountain french vanilla iced coffee1 green mountain hazelnut noisette1 green mountain caramel creme vanilla2 green mountain pumpkin spice   limited edition1 green mountain southern pecan2 grove square french vanilla cappuccino   dairy2 grove square caramel cappuccino   dairy2 grove square hazelnut cappuccino  dairy2 kahlua original1 gloria jean s mudslide1 gloria jean s french vanilla supreme1 gloria jean s butter toffee1 gloria jean s hazelnut1 wolfgang puck jamaica me crazy1 donut shop collection cinnamon roll1 donut shop collection chocolate glazed donutas well as a couple others that i have already drank and don t recall which they were overall i was very pleased with the variety i received and none of the included cups were expired  damaged or dried out in any way would definitely order again and suggest it to others p s  all of the included k cups were certified kosher  pleasantly surprised    and kosher ,1,0

5583,i m picky about my green teas  sometimes they re too weak  sometimes it just doesn t smell taste like green tea  or sometimes it s just horribly bitter sour and unpalatable  think most grocery store teas  but stash s green tea is terrific  there s a good element of leafyness  it is green after all  without much bitter sourness  i can usually pull at least 2 good cups of hot green tea from each tea bag i was actually previously disappointed by yogi s green tea  it s just purely green tea leaves  can t remember the exact name of it though    when steeped in hot water it smelled like burnt tires  so i almost lost hope in american grocery store teas  i previously would only buy the yamamotoyama green teas  slight roasted flavor  and stash s green tea tastes remarkably similar  which makes me incredibly happy due to the stash tea sales that have been going on at my local markets  woo    delicious ,1,0

5581,these cakes are quite tasty and similar to the commercially available zingers  only about half of the size per cake  each one is about four bites worth  a nice expenditure if you have reserve points but not filling if you are hungry for sweets   oh  these are available at about  3 50 per box  three costing you  10 50  in stop and shop and most supermarkets  amazon charges double  i don t know about you  but i work hard for my money and cannot see paying twice what is it worth    um    talk about a rip off ,1,0
5579,i drink this with sparkling water   the taste is great   if you re not worried about calories you can stop reading but if you haven t tried it before  don t be fooled by the name  drinking vinegar   there are a lot of sweeteners in this   here are the first four ingredients   cornelian cherry and pomegranate rice vinegar  high fructose corn syrup  dextrose  fructooligosaccharide   that s vinegar  then three sweeteners   the remaining ingredients are apple juice  mixed apple juice  and water two ounces of this drinking vinegar has 120 calories   so this not the miller lite of drinking vinegars one other thing  since cornelian cherry is a type of dogwood  this should probably be called  sempio drinking black rice vinegar    dogwood pomegranate     great taste   but not less filling,1,0
5587,nice change from the old style  boxes  where there was lots of packaging that went into the garbage  eco friendly  good seal so no problem with pectin becoming clumpy  at least so far screw bottle style also useful when you want to do a smaller batch of fruit towards the end of the season ball is the gold standard in canning supplies  i gave this product a try and was not disappointed  usual great ball quality,1,0

5511,all of the luck s edible images are beautiful  and they work exceptionally well on fondant  gum paste  buttercream  royal icing   i ve even used them on white chocolate   i ve never had a problem with the luck s edible images arriving dried out or broken    but you must keep the images in their foil package when they re not in use  otherwise  they will dry out    these images don t come with instructions  so if you do not have experience with edible images  you ll have to do some online research about using them on cakes or cookies   for basic cake decorating  roll out a large piece of fondant  drape it over your iced cake  and smooth and trim the fondant all around the cake   then  slightly moisten the fondant using a paint brush and water only at the points on the fondant where the edible image will cover    you don t want to get the water on the areas of the fondant that will not have the edible image covering    peel off your edible image  wrap it around the side of the cake or place it on top of the cake  and voila   you have a decorated cake  beautiful designs for your cakes  cookies  etc ,1,0

5501,a coworker shared her braggs acv one day at work when i came in terribly hungover  i swear this is not a common occurance  but hey i m only human   to help flush my system  i can t say that it was a miracle hangover cure  because really nothing is and if someone knows of one message me will ya  but it sparked my interest in this natural remedy  i bought my own bottle and began drinking 1 to 2 tablespoons diluted with water before bed  i didn t expect to see any miracles occur  or even to notice a difference in how i felt  and at first i didn t  however  after a few weeks it dawned on me that i had not felt tired at all throughout the day  nope  no usual after lunch  lethargic  i need a gd siesta feeling  it also dawned on me that everyone in my family had been sick  not to mention salon clients who pumped themselves full of cold medicine to come get their roots touched up  as they all but sneezed in my mouth while getting their bangs trimmed  i mean really  while i m mixing your color you want me to mix your theraflu too  stay home    sorry  that sneezing thing is gross but a reality  and guess who defied the odds and did not get sick  me  i figured you got that but just in case   and on top of that  and maybe the best difference i noticed  is that i slept like a freakin  baby  i had grown accustomed to waking up 1 to 2 nights a week and not being able to fall back asleep for four or so hours  i would toss  turn  my mind would race  then i would flip on the tv and watch 6 syndicated episodes of roseanne in a row at 3 in the morning  now as much as people are impressed that you can name all 6 of aunt jackie s professions in chronological order  they are even more impressed when you don t nod off in your car while at a four way stop  i m telling you i got the most restful and peaceful sleep i have had in years  like that deep nyquil sleep  except you re sober when your alarm goes off in the morning  so i have continued the acv regimen for months now  and if i wasn t convinced before  a couple weeks ago i didn t take it for 5 days and guess what happened  yep  daytime tiredness  moody as can be  and insomnia for the first time since i discovered this wonderful rotten battery acid tasting magic that is so so good for you  now  this expiriment is by no means scientifically sound and there are  of course  some uncontrolled variables that come into play  but from this skeptic s point of view  this stuff is the jam  i just know it works  and as for the afformentioned unpleasant flavor  i plug my nose while i chug it and pretend its lemonade  doing this completely blocks the flavor and you just have the acidic mouthfeel  those who tell you the flavor is good or just to add a little honey and its good or whatever  are lying  they will probably also tell you that they love the taste of quinoa and that apple sauce makes the perfect substitute for butter in your baked goods  okay so takeaway  get yourself some braggs and get on the road to better energy  immunity  and quality  sound sleep  i probably could have just said that right off the bat and spared your the rest  huh  sorry   from a skeptic  this stuff works ,1,0
5500,i like the fact that this product is all organic and tastes ok but is very salty   if you use this product  you pretty much can t add anymore salt to your dish   i prefer the taste of seitenbacher s vegetable broth powder over this   it has more flavor and is far less salty   don t get me wrong  this is a fine product but if you want more flavor  less salt  go for seitenbacher  i wrote a more in depth review on that product s page   tastes ok but   ,1,0

5544,i like to have a few treats on hand for my 2 cats  these were a good price  and i have twice bought the multipack of beachside crunch  since they tend to prefer fishy flavors  i would try the other flavors if they came in a mixed multipack  in case they didn t like the other flavors  they love these  they like most  treats  actually  and come running  as they hear the packet opening  or if i shake the bag  they are also a good way to sneakily apply their flea medicine to the back of their necks without them realizing it  they have a sixth sense about this and make themselves scarce whenever i even think about doing this  however  they also have outsmarted me when i tried to fool them into scarfing up some of their regular dry  friskies  cat food that i spilled on the floor when filling their bowls and thought i would try and get them to eat it straight off the floor  they ignored it  so i thought i would sprinkle a few treats among it to make them think they were getting a big treat  they came running  but managed to pick out and scarf up only the treats from among the other pieces  no problem eating treats off the floor  but regular food no way  the cats love them,1,0
5543,one of my children is allergic to wheat  so i ve been looking for an alternative to goldfish crackers for her   she was so frustrated when her sister got crackers for a snack and she did not about the taste   they are made with gouda cheese  not cheddar  so don t expect typical american cheese flavored snack   my older daughter  who can eat goldfish and is used to their flavor  disliked the wellaby s   my toddler  though  loves them   she will also eat  stinky cheese  with me  so she is not a picky eater   my husband liked them  as well  but said the taste was disconcerting at first  because he was expecting the typical  orange  flavor of most snack crackers about the company   they are super nice and responsive when you contact them   amazon did not list the ingredients when i was looking at purchasing the crackers   i emailed the manufacturer for the ingredient information   they emailed me back quickly with a complete listing of ingredients potato starchgouda cheesemilk cream  cow s milk corn flourrice flourcorn starchpotato fiberssodium caseinate  listed as milk protein saltyeast extract  from barley paprikaxanthan gumammonium carbonateglucono delta  lactonesodium carbonatemono and diglycerides  as a processing aid i would recommend these to anyone who was allergic to wheat or had gluten sensitivities  tasty  but not a typical cheese cracker,1,0
5541,i purchased this after success with the green pea and duck formula   i had hoped that our cats would take to it as well as they had the duck formula  but one has started to lose fur since switching   i suspect that she may be allergic or sensitive to chicken  so we ll be switching back to the duck and may try the salmon to add a little variety  lid green pea and chicken ,1,0

5534,ok  lets face it   sometimes you just want some good old fashioned sugar bombs for breakfast   but when you go to the store all of the  name brands  have gone to the dark side and are now  high fiber   whole grain or some such similar hooey  as if you could actually make sweetened breakfast cereal good for you   and they taste crappy  not at all like the original versions tootie fruties taste just like the old fashioned froot loops before being wussified   if you want the original taste and have not succumbed to the silly idea of making your sugar bombs  healthy  these are for you  tasty sugar bombs,1,0
5533,we typically buy the donut shop coffee and the jet fuel  my wife prefers donut shop  while i like the bolder jet fuel   it s not too strong  and not too weak   just right  in my opinion   i ll keep buying in the future  terrific coffee ,1,0
5532,i have tried it all from grinding my own beans to many different single cup devices  flavia  keurig    frankly the single cup devices wouldn t deliver the strong coffee flavor that i like  in addition the amount of waste from each k cup or flavia foil bag was disconcerting   with a senseo maching and melitta buzzworthy coffee i now get a rich cup every time and the amount of waste is  essentially coffee filter material wrapped around the ground coffee as opposed to foil or plastic refuse  great coffer at a great price ,1,0
5531,i purchased this product after it was recommended to me i found it to be a high quality product and my dog loves it however  after purchasing from this company online  i found that it was available locally for less than half the price that i paid here  fromm adult gold dog food,1,0

5526,i was looking for a zero or low calorie drink that didn t contain a lot of unnatural ingredients that could take the place of diet pepsi which i love but is not good for me since i have acid reflux   plus i had read where the artificial coloring to create the caramel color is not good   vitamin water didn t appeal to me because i thought how much of this stuff can i really drink   i don t want to overdose on too much vitamins   when i found hint water it seemed to be exactly what i was looking for  the first bottle i tried i was a little disappointed   you can smell the  flavor  more than taste it    it really is just a  hint  of flavor   however  the more i drank it the more i started to love this product and now this is my choice of drink   i don t write reviews   this is only the second review of written out of all the many products i ve purchased from amazon   give this product a chance   like i said  it was instant like for me but by the second or third bottle i discovered that this is really a great product and excellent way to drink more water  simply the best ,1,0
5522,product is delicious   however we ordered the last shipment in july  since the hot weather we recieved the item in chunk form as it had melted and stuck together rendering it unedible   recommend this item but not for shipment in hot weather  choclate covered,1,0

2572,i purchased mine at target  but the cost there is comparable to amazon s pricing  this definitely does not taste like coke  if that is what you base your tastes upon  please stay away from this  if you have an open mind to something along the lines of a pepsi or an rc cola or even a cola generic branded drink  i think you will be happy as this taste like it has a fruity essence to it without the sharp bitter edge that coke has  kind of like a softened soft drink of coke  very pleasing to the palette if you ask me if you re looking for a cost effective solution to having your own cola drink  then this is the way to go  definitely tastes different from coke,1,0
5005,i buy this from amazon because our local grocery stores do not carry any form of this rice  just do not overcook this  i tried it in a rice cooker so it would be done when i came back home  it was way overdone    just follow directions on the box  very good rice,1,0
5002,package is not same as what you show  am i getting an outdated product  i bought some in a foodlion in nc last summer and the package looked like what you show not what i got  and i think it was richer and better  roy package different,1,0
4477,i was looking for a sugar free breakfest drink which i thought this was  after i order it and the powder version i found a web site that showed the label  it has 12g of sugar so if your a diabetic beware  haven t got it yet so can t say about the taste update  drank 2 packs of the three so far and i m very pleased with this  the taste is rather good and after drinking this you can see we really do have to much sugar in our diets  it has a dark chocolate type flavor to me which i guess is do to it being low in sugar  regular version of this has 31g of sugar  turns out the 12g of sugar is from the 11oz of milk which isn t a problem  i reordered 4 more 3 packs  at the price of  14 64 with free shipping it beats walmarts price of  4 88 a 4 pack  looks like it pays to report a lower price when you find it to amazon  i did and their price dropped for this since my last order  beware  not sugar free    but    ,1,0
4475,natural balance indoor ultra dry cat food is a product that my cats love   at least i guess they do because they vote with their eating behavior   this is one of two products they will choose to eat and that doesn t make them throw up   of the two products this is by far the healthiest   it even makes their poop smell okay and that is saying a lot for a cat  my four cats love it ,1,0
4474,o my gosh   this bite size lemon wafer is so tasty   we enjoy almost everything lemon and these wafers do not disappoint if we must inject one concern  it is some of the nutrition info   some ingredients 1st three 3  highest content in product for such a small serving size  see below          a serious guilty pleasure because a serving is just eight 8 bite size true to description wafers   it is so hard to eat just eight 8 because wafer is tiny and taste good     you decide     nutrition facts serving size   8 cookies  servings per container  about 4  calories  150  calories from fat 70  total fat  8g  sat fat 6 g  sodium  30 mg  carbohydrate  19g  sugar  9 g  protein  1 gingredients wheat flour  coconut oil  glucose syrup  sugar  whey powder milk   dextrose  soy flour  barley malt extract  powered lemon juice 2  in the cream  salt  raising agents sodium hydrogen carbonate  disodium disphosphate   emulsifier soy lecithins  bourbon vanilla pods  lemon essential oil  spices   may contain hazelnute  almonds  and oats product of austria   no colouring and no preservatives   keep cool and dry  can t go wrong with lemon        ,1,0

4470,i liked these candies alot  but thought they were costly for the amt of pieces i got  after all they werent chocolate just plain candy sticks candy review,1,0
4469,i actually purchased this to origanally replace galic powder as that what i typed in when this came up  i figured i use a peppercorn grinder and a seasalt grinder  so why not a garlic grinder  sadly the grinder on this unit still leaves the dried garlic in large chunks  which means it is essentially putting dried minced garlic on or in your food  with how readiliy available peeled garlic cloves are at the grocery store  mincing fresh garlic is almost as easy  is cheaper  and tastes better than this product  that being said this is the best tasting dry garlic i have ever had  but i cannot recommend buying it overall i am giving it four stars  as i think it is the best product at what it is  but the failed logic behind it will prevent it from getting five stars  tastes great  but not so useful,1,0
4478,i read a review from someone who stated that the cdm coffee was bitter  not like the version that he she got at the cafe du monde coffee shop in downtown new orleans   here is the secret   when brewing any coffee  add a pinch of salt   you will not taste the salt and the bitterness will be gone   btw  the coffee  is the same as that used at the cafe du monde  but two things are different   1  they grind beans from cdm fresh each day for their brewers and 2  you are using a different brewing system than they do cdm coffee   chicory  regular grind  13 ounce cans  pack of 4  removing  bitterness  in coffee,1,0

4466,i m not familiar with the safcol brand but being a tuna addict  gave this a shot  the tuna tastes like it s good quality but i found the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland  it s better than something plain but it didn t pack the punch i was hoping for  it s still a great option for a low calorie  low fat meal  not bad,1,0
4465,this fi shock ss 725rp ac works  our 11 yr  old labrador decided to start digging at garden age 9 as there is a cider block barrier wal at the back of it  that the garden fence seperated the dog from  mice find the wal as an oasis because our dog who patroled the wall religiously  can now no longer get there to keep them away  he therefore could not stay out of our 20x20 garden  once a fence went up  we have a chicken wire fence around it  and he just dug at the bottom constantly  we installed this unit and it quickly stopped him  we heard him yelp aboout 3x s  and that was all that was needed it is not most convienient to have to plug it in  but the price break for an ac unit compared to a solar unit makes up for this  we turned it off a few times  and our dog would know so i assumed they can feel a vibration or hear a frquency  but that theory fell through as it has been unplugged for a month now and no digging it works great for us i plan to put in at the base of the porch where we buily a shed where the our dog digs like crazy  as there are mice or moles around it  it really works  also those plastic owls thatyou can purchase seem to keep squirrels nd birds form eating tomatoes  peppers and so on   hope to store it and use it again next summer  i totally recomend it  if you have a digging dog in the garden  thisworks   ,1,0

4463,i enjoyed this product very much and am a little disappointed that i couldn t get more of it but will definately check back to buy more  i enjoyed this product,1,0
4461,i commented on someones review of this product whos dog became very ill  which caused me to look at some of the other negitive reviews and i would like to offer information about this product and my experiance with smokehouse   i have purchased this brand for many years  i have also purchased other brands  none of my dogs has every gotten sick from a smokehouse bone  at one point i purchased a bag of 3 bones that were a differant brand  when i opened up the bag a cloud of mold poofed into the air  obviously i didnt give them to my dogs  my point is this the brand this happened with is well known and reliable  but that doesnt mean nothing ever goes wrong   most people at sometime in their life have purchased a moldy loaf of bread  or cheese or even gone to a resturant where there was something very definantly wrong with the food  it may not happen often but when it does its dangerous  and unpleasant  but we still continue to buy food at the grocery store and go to resturants there are differances in opinions of even vets as to whether or not you should use properly cured beef bones or raw hide chews  i have never had a problem with the cured beef bones from smokehouse and i know of vets that recommend bones vs rawhide chews and rawhide chews vs cured beef bones  yes pieces of bone can be broken off  swallowed  and then get lodged in the system  i also know of dogs that have had rawhide chews that have caused serious health issues  if a dog gets a large enough piece of rawhide swallowed  contrary to what some think it does not get fully digested and can also cause vomiting and even a blockage when you deal with food whether its for pets or humans things do go wrong the smokehouse bones keep my dogs teeth free of tartar  they have fun  im happy and have never had a problem  i under no circumstances will give my dogs rawhide anything  ive know of several dogs that have had issues with rawhide and only one dog that had a minor problem with a cured beef bone and it was not a smokehouse bone  smokehouse is an excellant brand,1,0
4460,purchased this through amazon  as i could not find them locally and they were needed as part of a candy jeopardy game in my workplace to go with a theme   they arrived in a small envelop  in a see through plastic bag  the bag was sealed very well  as when you opened it   the waft of hot cinnamon was intense there were 80 small fireballs   if you put a dime over the fireball it nearly covers it  the flavor was also great would buy again  would recommend to others and would give as a gift  if the occasion called for it   80 small fireballs,1,0
4459,this stuff stinks but your dog will love it   if your dog is a fussy eater  mine are not   or if they re feeling under the weather  supplement this or any of the tripett blends  and you will be surprised how well your dog responds  i read about the benefits of green tripe when one of my dogs became very ill and could not handle dry dog food anymore   i switched both dogs to a raw diet and tripett  and presto  a remarkable rebound in their health and appearance   i was feeding a very high grade dry food at the time  so i did not go from junk food to high quality  it is just that dogs need to eat whole  raw foods not cooked processed meal  it s the carbs in dog food that create most of the skin and health issues not grains   carbs turn to sugar and then to yeast   it is the yeast that causes ear infections and bad skin and coat  i don t work for tripett  just a good customer  this stuff stinks ,1,0
4467,i feel this was faulty advertising on this product   the picture looks like two boxes of coffee   when i received the package it was only 1 box   the price was ok  but not really a bargain  faulty advertising,1,0
4457,i had no idea this water was black  i thought it was just the packaging and as i was driving had no idea until i looked down  shocked to see that the plastic bottle was indeed transparent  so  completely unbiased  i thought that the water tasted just like another alkaline water   alka pure   which is in the same price bracket  i have no idea as to the veracity of claims fulvic minerals are good for you or not but the taste of this water  and the cool fact that it is indeed black  put it at the top of my list for expensive bottled water  no idea what people are talking about that the taste is  salty  or weird  it obviously has a slightly metallic taste because of the mineral content which i vastly prefer over the calcium softness or chorine tinged waters available by tap or cheap mass production  hope that common sense will prevail over the overwhelmingly negative reviews this product seems to get  if people can look past the black  which i think is its chief selling point   then i think consumers will ultimately champion this water  best water on market,1,0
4479,completely opposite of other reviewer   i love these cookies   however  if you are looking for a cookie that is laden with sugar and chemicals  this is not it   these aren t overly sweet   and really not too much chocolate taste in these either   but i like them   finally  a cookie that tastes good that i can eat   no chemicals  very little salt  35mg  and only 5mg cholesterol   oh  and the sugar is only 3g   so  definitely not sweet  i love these cookies ,1,0
4484,i absolutely love these pretzels   i am very disappointed that i can no longer buy them on subscribe   save   don t know who s at fault with this but i wish you could get it worked out  glutino gluten free pretzels,1,0
4504,well  i ll be darned  i tried the    contains no alcohol   jack danials   jim beam   budwieser   and white lit ninbarbeque sauces  so i tried this when i saw it at my localstore   it s okay  but i think i ll just keep pouring real dr pepperon my ribeye steaks  charcoal flames ummmmm  10 00 2 00 4 00   drink a bite to eat     indeed  great flavor  but not enough doctor pepper flavor to make a decent ice cream soda ,1,0
4503,i thought i had had real ginger beer until i drank this   cut off a piece of ginger from a ginger bud and see how it taste and then compare that taste to this beer   you will quickly realize that this is the real thing and that you have never had real ginger beer till you have tasted this   great too for an upset stomach this is the real thing ,1,0
4502,i ordered the 180 pack from amazon which came in a sturdy brown box  however  the creamer s container itself is so thin that 14 pieces leaked inside the box  we ve always bought the powder form and wanted to try liquid creamer this time  it still tastes great  same coffeemate creamer we ve loved for years  i just wished the container was not too flimsy  poor packaging,1,0
4501,we have a black female lab  and since she was little she would not eat anything but pedigree and as long as shd was fine we gave it to her  for the past 3 months she was licking her paws  itching  she had bald spots  i treated her with different kind of oitments which brought her coat back at thr bald spots however she was still licking and itching  shaking  we finally decided to change her food from that horrible by products pedigree to wellness and two days later less itching licking and everything  although it is pricey i dont care she is herself again  great ,1,0
4500,mccormick cinnamon sugar is truly special  a mixture of ground cinnamon and granulated sugar doesn t cut it  yuck    you ve got to have  mccormick cinnamon sugar  on your creme of wheat and oatmeal  boy  do i pour this stuff on  want to make french toast to die for  sprinkle liberally on both sides  so tasty  syrup isn t necessary  enjoy   regrettably  since all amazon vendors charge high shipping fees  i only now replenish my stock at the local grocery   french toast to die for,1,0
4499,i ve been buying this product for years   it is definitely the best baby white cheddar cheese popcorn i have tried   for those who love strong cheese flavour  this is the strongest you will find  at least that i know of    i wish they made it in extra sharp  but they probably wanted a  middle of the road  cheese for the majority of consumers who might find extra sharp too strong for them in any event  there really aren t that many companies that make baby white popcorn with cheddar cheese in the first place   the larger sized corn and yellow corn just are not the same quality as baby white  cheese or no cheese that crap made by smartfood that is sold in the markets is horrendous  not to mention lots of partially popped kernels    the popcorn made by deep river has less hulls because it is baby sized  which is better for the digestive track  especially for those of us that are older    also less partially popped kernels than the other brands i have tried there is great popcorn out of colorado  cornzapoppin  made fresh just before shipping  but it is full sized   the flavours are great  but there s just nothing like baby white corn  did i say that already     it s also rather expensive  but does make a great gift for those you want to spend money on so until someone else makes a high quality baby white sharp cheddar popcorn  i am loyal to this deep river snacks product  best baby white cheddar popcorn on the market ,1,0
4497,but the actual taste is fantastic  i usually don t drink a large amount each time because it leans toward high price size  but it s well worth the money  it contains a balanced nutrients from both fruits and vegetables i like its taste  but the last bottle i purchases had a slight change of taste  which was a similar taste i disliked from a similar product of another brand  it s fine the taste change slightly because it means the smoothie truly uses fresh vegetables and fruits  which do have changes of tastes from time to time  however  i hope the new taste doesn t last long  at first glance it looks creepy,1,0
4481,i don t mind receiving this in a paper bag  it has a 35 different kinds as shown  it has 2 hot coco k cup and i am not a hot coco person but again i don t mind  at least i get to try it  it even arrived 4 days earlier from the estimated day of arrival  over all 5 5  i am happy with the product  received as promised ,1,0
4496,i love this product but the packaging was deficient   several sugar packs were broken and there was sugar throughout the box  product good   packaging not good,1,0
4493,my dog really enjoys these and they do not last long  she is not a big chewer  and doesn t like bones  so i wanted to get something that she could much on from time to time so to help clean her teeth  i was attracted to these because they are low calorie and made in the us  when you get them out of the package they don t look like food  but the dogs don t really mind  they are flexible enough to cut in half with kitchen shears if you have a small dog  my dog really likes these,1,0
4492,this gum has to be the most sour thing i ve ever had  way more sour than there own hard candy  after the sour goes away the gum is pretty darn flavorful  and fairly long lasting  extreme sour,1,0
4491,makes a very good cup of coffee  not too strong and not bitter but very flavorful  stands up to creamer and you can still taste the coffee  very good cup of coffee,1,0
4490,very interesting product to say the least   quite frankly i found this no different than any other water i have been drinking throughout my life  so if anybody is wondering how it tastes like  i hope this helps   whether or not different ph helps or hurts you  i cannot answer that as i am not a doctor nor do i play one in real life  but it was very good and very drinkable   however since i do not know whether this actually helps me somehow  to me it is just a bottle of slightly overpriced water  tastes just like water     nope  not a joke ,1,0
4488,i use to be able to set my watch to af after iud  copper  i became irregular  would skip atleast 2 mos no longer have iud still irregular  went to the dr  the prescriptions came out  i don t take hormones or b control because it does not work well w  my system at all        so that was out  you would think that the dr  would try alternatives knowing that depo almost killed me  one shot  only but not quite  of course not  right  story short after labs i needed to balance my hormones naturally  i had all kinds of symptoms from the imbalance  e g   sore nips  tired  not sleeping well  irritated and retaining unwanted weight to say the least even working out not loosing as fast as i know i should  i thought i would try this tea  now i have a really sensitive system  i don t drink i don t smoke and if there is a side effect usually i would get it  i drank this tea  one bag  wednesday afternoon and immediately started feeling weird and felt cramps  i got tired hence  suppose to give you energy  and went to sleep when i woke up i felt rejuvenated had the best sleep i had since june it is now september  the next day i felt soreness in my nips subside a great deal  but i was sore in my neck and my butt as if i had worked out hadn t this might be a side effect   so i decided to lay off the tea for a few days until the soreness left  thursday was feeling a bit lighter so i got on the scale lost 2 lbs i weighed in at the dr  wednesday at 157 tax and was 155 00 no change  by friday once i got home from work af  very light but  it was there  one cup of tea for me  last cycle may  wipe spotting on august 28 september 3 it is september 22nd we we will see what else happens i just finished my 2nd cup  i usually don t write reviews  but with the hope this product gave me i thought i would share  p s  i dont mind the taste is it amaaazzziiinggg   absolutely not but it is ok  two days later,1,0

4485,synthetic food dyes are  1  gross  and  2  cause lots of allergic reactions in our family  if you just want to add flair to your food for the holidays  ie   easter eggs  christmas cookies   birthday celebrations  etc   this is the way to go  the price is a bit steep and it will not last as long as an artificial food colorant because it s made from actual food and not crud  but buying it once or twice a year won t totally break the bank either  color food without all the crap ,1,0
4495,the advertised weight was 5 lbs  for  58 and the actual weight was 4 4 lbs   the product quality was good but i got short changed by 10   short changed on the product,1,0
4505,these are good  and if you like ghost chili s then don t get me wrong you have a good batch here  however this batch screams quantity   quality  because smelling the peppers as a whole smelt like cardboard in some parts  and a few peppers i ate tasted like that  still had the spice though   so it feels like with this batch someone takes all the bhut jolokia peppers they harvest  ignoring the strange smelling ones  so while it s a good batch overall and most of the peppers are good  the 18 gram is all perfect quality peppers  all of them ripe and not giving off the musty cardboard smell  so if you want quantity this is perfect  but if you want quality buy a couple of the 18 grams  not as good as the 18 gram batch,1,0
4456,now you may ask why pay to have h20 packed and shipped half way around the world just to be guzzled in a mater of seconds  minutes at the most well  nothing  is the reason  everyday you hear about the odd stuff that is in local water supplies  my favorite statement is  it may look nasty and taste awful but it is perfectly safe   so we turn to bottled water that is everything from the same local water just packaged to fancy mineral water that needs lime to mellow it out  included in this category is a concoction called drinking water  they take everything out and put back what they guess makes water drinkable  the worst sort of stuff is items packed in colorful plastic bottles that taste like colorful plastic evian on the other hand is water the way that nature intended  it goes down smooth and has no after taste  it is refreshing when cooled but can work well even at room temperature  gourmet coffee locations use this as the base water because it does not distract from the taste  the water is even used externally for applying and removing makeup  i keep a case in the car incase of any emergency that may come up there is  nothing  more satisfying  nothing,1,0
4454,my puppy finished the edible bone in a couple days  but unfortunately she also ate half the non edible brown plastic bone     tha only bone she still has  2 months  is the whilte bone  okay,1,0
4432,but there is something strange about the packaging   my home is constantly over 76f  so it is always a liquid   when it arrived  the box was partially soaked with coconut oil   i can t find the leak and the bottle and inner seal seems to be ok   since i only use it for hair and skin care  i am keeping it the smell is really nice and not overwhelming   maybe it s the only oil available in bulk that do not put off people with the smell update  it s the same thing when my other oils arrived   they are dense   since their bottles are almost unbreakable  they packaging is normally just big air bubbles loosely around them   they experience violence forces during transit   the bottles have a pretty normal secure seal like any normal products in the supermarket   but their seal broke during individual transit   that explains the slight leaks   when fall comes  the oil turn into a beautiful solid now i understand what is a light oil   coconut oil is not   you can t apply it to your hair without using a normal shampoo to remove the greasy feeling   the strong greasy feeling that you cannot stand going to bed with it in your dry hair   you may want a thick oil for the skin though   you got instant soft skin even for hardened sole   but whether it does anything to the skin long term is another story btw  many other oils are near odourless   this oil is the exception that have a faint coconut odour to it  i like the product,1,0
4431,i have problem hair  there s all kinds of textures in it  from thin and silky to fried and crinkled  i can t wash it every day or it would be more on the fried side  also  as i ve aged  my scalp has started to dry out  i wouldn t say i have dandruff every day  but i  can  have some if i end up itchy right before i wash my hair i really did itch less with this conditioner  in fact  i ve been trying all sorts of conditioners since i ran out of this  and i also went back to my old conditioner  but nothing has worked to both moisturize my hair and calm that  need to wash my hair  scalp itch  i thought it would end up drying my hair out further  but i used it about a month  and that didn t happen  so  i m sold on it  and if you have some scalp itch  i think it s worth trying out  this is my new conditioner,1,0
4430,the real stuff  great  unlike what has horribly happened to see s version that i used to love  artificial flavor now and tastes nasty   great peanut brittle,1,0
4429,my order was turned over to usps priority mail for delivery to me and  unfortunately  was apparently lost in mail handling   i was initially upset with the delay in receiving the product but  when the vendor was appraised of the contretemps  i was notified that a replacement shipment had be sent which i could expect to receive within two days the replacment shipment arrived promptly and i was pleased with the quality of the honey and its convenient packaging   i cannot hold the vendor responsible for the mis handling by the united states postal service and as far as the product itself  it was as good  or better  than any honey i have ever purchased anywhere  including honey purchased in the comb   i unhesitatingly recommend ys organic bee farms clover honey to anyone interested in an excellent organic product   i will order it again  an excellent organic honey from a producer who cares,1,0
4428,to start i should say i hate almonds  i don t dislike them  i hate them  and i have tried all manner of almonds  from raw to various flavors   a former co worker brought a huge jug of these to work and urged me to give one a try  like the stubborn child who refuses to eat her veggies  i popped one in my mouth  with a large glass of water in hand to wash down what i expected to be the awful  to me  flavor  i was shocked to find i not only didn t object to these  but became hooked on them in short order i have been unable to find this flavor in the mega jug my co worked purchased at a big box retailer over a year ago and was pleased to find this option on amazon for a price lower than my local grogery store  i wish that big jug were available  but these smaller cans probably assure a fresher product i will add  that i am a big fan of vinegar  but am not a big fan of salt and vinegar chips  these almonds have an excellent balance of flavor  full of flavor,1,0
4426,romeo really enjoys these treats and i recommend them  but i was shipped 1 package  not 6   when i called to have this fixed   i was shipped 1 package  twice again   i ended up just having them refund the remaining 3 packs   maybe i ll just order the larger 7 oz package next time  dog really likes  but shipped incorrectly,1,0

4433,we ve used beneful several times in the past year  overall it s a good quality and the dogs seem to like it fine  they re not terribly excited about it though  they look at it and almost say  well  ok if that s all you got   we have three  australian shepherd  jack russell  and a mini schnauzer  we also have a neighbor dog  lab mix  that comes over to eat whenever possible  since there s enough competition  think  if you re not going to eat that  then i will or i ll eat it just so you can t have it  there are rarely leftovers  sometimes there are leftovers and like i said it rarely happens  but does more often with this brand  decent feed  but there is better out there  dogs like it just fine  but not terribly excited about it   ,1,0

4419,on that warm july day when i first opened the recently arrived cardboard box of mystery  i was deeply saddened and upset when the dinobone i purchased was in fact a stegasaurus and not the advertised t rex what would my dog think  surely all humans and animals are well aware that the stegasaurus comes nowhere near the badassness of a t rex  would my dog like it  would it chew on its nylony stega carcus yes  dinobone   ,1,0
4418,the product is fantastic   a lovely tasting tea that brings clarity  peace of mind  and a really positive natural energy   i would buy it regularly except for the ridiculous postage and customs charges   the postage was more than the actual product itself   27  however i do believe the tea is very reasonably priced  at around 23 for 100 tea bags  no more than any other herbal tea that you can buy at health food stores    and there s no match for coca tea     so i thought ok  i ll do it this once its worth it    and then i was hit with a further 25 customs charge that i was forced to pay or my product would be going back to sender   i was not going to let it go back when i d already paid double for it   i wasn t informed that there was a possibility of this happening  and my total charge for a 25 product now came to 75   it wasn t at any point told what the postal costs covered  what exactly was i paying for if not the ensuing customs charges  i was also not notified that my package was even being held anywhere  it just didn t show up and i had to contact the seller to ask what was going on  i was further unimpressed by the defensive attitude of the response i got  which stated that they had to pay an extremely high postage to get it to me         i m sorry but i have a hard time believing that when i d just paid 50 to get a 25 item delivered   are they telling me that it cost more than 50  that they too paid high postage prices on top of mine  i don t think so  whatever they had to pay they would have made sure they covered it with what they charged me  if i am wrong i strongly suggest they investigate the postal services that they are using for over charging as i have never heard of anything quite so unreasonable  i ve given it a high rating only because the actual tea is such a great product  but i won t be buying it here again  i don t know what other sellers are like for postage but i m disappointed with amazon   with this seller after that experience  i think people need forewarning about the charges before they make a decision to buy      great product  extortionate postage made a 25 item cost 75  ,1,0

4414,i m a us soldier currently deployed to afghanistan   i experienced these in a series of care packages from a group called operation gratitude   they re the most tasty things i have ever received in a care package   i ran around the whole camp  asking anybody else who received these if they didn t want them  so i could have them   now i m trying to buy them on my own  but sadly  no business s seem to ship them to apo address s on their own   i m having to have my family buy them and send them to me  wish they would send them overseas   ,1,0

4453,i bought some of the potato popchips   some of the tortilla chips in the flavor variety pack   i felt the potato were good  but the texture was odd  the taste was onlt from the powder  and it absorbed the water from my mouth   stuck to my tongue   only the bbq popchip was really really good i would buy both kinds again  but only one is better than chips available in the store i really liked the tortilla popchips   they have a corn flavor  it has the texture of a puffed up corn chip  and it s not sticky in the mouth   i m not a big fan of powdered flavors  but i didn t mind these so much   i enjoyed the nacho  ranch  salsa  and chili lemon tortilla popchips  more flavor   better texture than potato popchips,1,0

4451,i ve been ordering these treats for my dogs for a few years now   they really liked them  the cookies were not only adorable  but apparently pretty tasty  recently  though  the last few boxes i ve bought have contained nothing but broken remnants of the advertised shapes of cookies that don t even have the cute outlines on them that originally distinguished them from each other  additionally  the cookies look overcooked and are very hard  plus   they no longer have that fresh baked smell to them  i really am disappointed in the quality control from blue dog bakery  for the amount of money i spend on these  i expect consistency to the quality  i guess i need to find another low fat treat alternative for my furry family members  declining quality,1,0
4450,we recently got two 5 month old cats from the shelter   they both love the regular kitten wellness in the pink can  but for some reason won t touch this core formula   they ll eat several other brands and other wellness formulas  so the reason is not that they only like one product   the regular formula still happens to be grain free  so we will not be buying the core again   i still gave this product 4 stars because it looks like a quality product and is grain free and chicken based  kittens do not like the core formula,1,0
4449,it arrived quicker than i thought     but when opening the bags of chocolate some of the peices had gone kind of pale and white   it looked like it had melted and then dryed   i am sure it got hot and just melted   the taste was ok but not very appetizing   not sure how this could be avoided       but overall it was fine  bounty bars,1,0

4446,i live in an urban neighborhood and i hate flies so i m starting to buy these things by the crate   everyone should use them  they work pros   i ve killed literally thousands of flies   gallons of flies  eventually i think i ll manage to wipe out the local breeding population and get ahead of the curve   trick is to start early in the spring   what one is really trying to achieve is population control not just killing a few flies   otherwise  depending on your landscape of course  the neighbors flies will just move in   bottom line if you use it according to the directions this flytrap works extremely well   many of the negative reviews here clearly didn t read the directions   it really needs to be in sunlight cons   it reeks   seriously   i can t imagine anyone using this inside their house   when it gets going you don t really want to be within 20 feet of it   unbelievably strong smell of rotting garbage  and though it s theoretically reusable  you are unlikely to do so unless you have a really strong stomach   think a big jar of rotting dead and half dead flies   it s really foul bottom line  if you use it properly   think some form of perimeter defense  with targeting of fly hot spots like garbage cans with loose lids  you can make your world fly free   if you have really few flies  one jar properly located will take care of them  but you should actually spend some time analyzing what you need anecdotally and by observation  btw  this seems like the most effective fly trap on the market works very well,1,0
4444,saw this  which for some reason i didn t think i would  for about half the store price in my neck of the woods and even with shipping it was still cheaper  don t know what happened to dentyne but this really does freshen your breathe and when you get to be my age ya need all the help you can get  it is a proven fact by the way on that point  saw a review here somewhere where a person said some chemical was in that causes cancer and got a good rebuttal from another that cleared that up  jeeze doesn t everything these days cause cancer  i mean i wouldn t go out and gnaw on car batteries but for cryin  out loud you could probably eat too many banannas or anything else in this world and get that sort of thing  hey its all a crap shoot anyway     like the gum   great price   ,1,0

4441,any instant isn t as good as the real thing  but for instant  nongshim makes a decent group of instant noodles  this is probably the best kimchi instant noodles out there  avoid paldo  that is total garbage  add an egg to this to really add some flavor  but be warned  it may make the soup a little bland  add a tiny bit of kimchi juice to it  to spice it up remember    do not overcook the noodles  it is disgusting if you overcook the noodles  the noodles cook in the hot broth anyway  so turn off stove early on  and don t add too much water of you will get bland soup  and don t let soup evaporate too much  or you will get salty soup  it s all about balance     good luck update  yup  you gotta microwave it  otherwise  it s gross  i know  you smarties are probably laughing your donkeys off     i ve revised it to 5 stars  it s pretty good  but let it cool off for 3 mins  you ll burn your mouth off  if you try it while  hot   soup is spot on  noodles are pretty decent  best kimchi noodles there is   updated,1,0

4445,i made the mistake of putting too much milk in the jar the first time i made kefir with these grains  old habit  but thought  what the heck  it won t hurt the grains  in 24 hours i strained the milk out of the grains and added just less than a pint  about 12 ounces  of milk to them the second time  i drank the slightly soured milk from the first batch  not bad  within 24 hours that short pint had turned into the thickest  smoothest  yummiest kefir ever  i ve made 2 more batches since and the last one was with 3 cups of milk  absolutely perfect  i m convinced that my next batch will do a full quart  highly recommend this product ps  i use a low heat pasteurized milk  i would not recommend using regular pasteurized milk and absolutely do not use ultra pasteurized milk  raw milk will work but only for the first and maybe second batch as the wild bacteria in the raw milk compete with the kefir grains  if you use raw milk then always let your kefir grains renew themselves in some pasteurized milk  best homemade kefir yet ,1,0
4411,let me start by saying i m a very cheap person and for the past 4 years have only give my cats friskees wet food  i actually did splurge and get them royal canin sensitive stomach as dry food though  in my defense  and that stuff isn t cheap  however  in the past few months  my older cat started licking all the hair off of her stomach and was scratching constantly  two trips to the vet and two steroid injections later  everything was ruled out but an allergic reaction to either the litter i was using  arm   hammer  or the food  to avoid paying more vet bills and to make my little fur baby happy  i decided to man woman  up and get the good stuff  you know  the stuff with no disgusting animal by products  rice  grain  and brewer s yeast in it  i never really took the time to read the back of the friskee s label or the label of the royal canin  you think if you pay a lot for something it will be healthy  but it s not  i feel like such a bad parent in any event i completely switched everything  started using pine pellets for the litter  which is all natural  and got this core brand food because it appeared to be exactly what my cats needed  something completely free of anything bad for them  i was also instructed by my vet not to feed them chicken or beef because a lot of allergies come from that  so i have only purchased the turkey duck seafood types of core food  both wet and dry summary of the wet  yeah  it s almost  2 00 a can  makes you a little ill thinking about it  but i ve never seen my cats literally lick the entire plate clean and want more than two servings in a day of anything  when i fed them friskee s i was easily throwing away half a can a day just by having it be left over and stale on their plate  not with this core food  they devour it and come back for more  it s amazing  my wallet doesn t thank me but those cats sure do as for the dry food  it s a little different in shape texture than other dry foods  they eat it  but i think they like the wet better  i leave out dry food during the day in case they get hungry so i know they are eating it  but they much prefer the wet my animals eat better than i do and get better medical care than i do   sigh  my cats actually lick the plate clean  woah ,1,0
4507,at the age of 30 i developed severe hormonal acne mainly on my cheeks  chin  and upper lip area  i went to a dermatologist who said this is  normal  for women my age with a hormonal imbalance    acne tends to develop around the areas that men get facial hair  she wanted me to take birth control  some other hormonal pill  and use 2 facial creams instead i found this tea  now keep in mind i d been dealing with this acne for 2 years and it continued to get progressively worse  i was up to 2 or 3 new zits a day  i started to drink only one cup of this a day and within a month i noticed a significant difference  after 2 months the breakouts stopped altogether  if i stop drinking the tea the breakouts return within a week or so and i have to start the process all over  learned that the hard way    twice  so i ll just continue to drink the tea    i never had any cycle imbalance problems and i still don t  i chose to write this review because the acne had been taking a toll on my overall self esteem and i was getting to the point that i hated going to work    or leaving the house for that matter  i d never had acne before in my life  this tea has been a blessing and is just part of my daily routine now  the scars have healed and i do not get breakouts anymore i never took what the doctor prescribed for me  so yes i m sure the tea is what s doing the trick  and like i said    when i stop drinking it the breakouts start back up  if i skip a day or two it doesn t seem to have an affect  i drink the red raspberry leaf tea with it i really hope this review helps someone else  if it does    please comment to let me know  thanks  cures my adult hormonal acne,1,0

4573,i purchased this gum after an exhaustive search for sugar free gum that didn t contain aspartame  which is an additive that is bad for people with sensitive gi tracts  and may have other negative health consequences   almost all gums contain aspartame and it s very difficult to find a product that doesn t this gum met all the basic criteria i needed  i tried a few other brands that didn t contain aspartame including glee gum triple berry  18 piece boxes  pack of 12    between was the best  primarily because the taste lasted and the gum doesn t harden after a few minutes of chewing  granted  the flavor of this gum won t last as long as standard commercial gum found at the grocery store  but that s the tradeoff for purchasing a more healthy product as a  healthy  gum product  between gets 5 stars  even as judged by commercial gum standards  flavor  longevity  etc    this product would get 4 stars  good sugarfree option w o unhealthy additives,1,0

4588,i received a package of chocolate which were melted and the ice packets hot  i filled out return form and within a couple of days i not only was notified through amazon that i would be getting a full refund but i also received a personal email from the company apologizing for the situation  maybe i will order the chocolate in winter when it s not 100 degrees in tucson  i was so thrilled and felt like they exemplified the best customer service  i will definitely let my friends know and i will look to buy from them in the future  great customer service ,1,0
4574,thats what we acted like when we set up this machine and made snow cones   easy set up  the ice was shaved like a slush bought at a baseball game   we tried a variety of flavors that were all pleasing   it never stopped working for a neighborhood party and we mustve made approx  30 40 cones counting all the adults   cleanup was a breeze  just drained right out   no washing or turning it around to get all the water out our only regret was that we didnt purchase this 5 yrs  ago  grownup kids,1,0
4586,if my dog is any indicator this may be the best dog treat there is  it is made in texas  not china   has pretty wholesome ingredients and from my experience is not unreasonably expensive and the dog loves them  they are crisp and snap easily into smaller pieces if necessary  now about that product description    it says  pack of 5  and shows 5 merrick chicken steak patties just like they would look unwrapped from the pack  the problem is that at  60 99 this comes to about  12 00 per patty which is unreasonably expensive  ok  so maybe what they mean is that there are 5 of these 5 packs which would be about  2 40 per patty  this is still more than twice as much as they charge for them retail at the local pet food store  in the product description it says the product weighs 1 lb  well  one 5 pack weighs 2 5 oz  so 5 would only weigh 12 5 oz  the shipping weight is listed as 4 5 lbs    i just don t understand how this can possibly be correct  if you are brave enough to ignore this questionable product description and try this purchase you will get a great dog treat but if you end up paying more than  1 00 per patty you should just buy from the retail pet food stores next time  great treat  really poor product description,1,0
4584,appearance   weird   honestly  it kinda puts you in the mind of  regurgitated  food from an extremely large pelican   i alllllmost didn t use it cause i thought it went bad or somethin  salty as heck  geesh  you could cure a corpse in this stuff    sorry but seriously   however  i advise you to just take my word at this and just use it  don t taste it    because you might change your mind and decide to throw it out because it taste like  salty regurgitated food from   yep you got it  if you re a  sodium warden    immo be honest   just pass it by and yes   like everyone probably knows on here    a little  goes a lonnnnnnng way   if you use too much  well   don t say i didn t warn you taste     delicious  crackin  delicious   there was no salty taste in the end product   i marinated chicken for 2 days   i got worried because i actually forgot about the chicken and we alllll know the last thing you wanna smell is  bad chicken    now that i think about it  the excess salt probably prevented that unfortunately  i burnt some of the chicken while grilling  definitely grill  it gets the best taste  smoke   jerk  well it just belongs together   the parts i could eat though    fan blessing tastic   seriously  no salty taste what so ever   and if you don t really like chicken thighs  i don t either    jerking is what a chicken has thighs for it s takes that funny   chicken thigh ee   dark meat   errrr   taste out of it i don t know how to explain it but chicken thigh meat taste   well   funny to me   but hey  jerked thighs   jerked juicy tastiness   now  that s c h i c k e n thighs   not real people thighs people   yeeees  it may yield more meat but ughh   yeah   that s demented and you can go to jail for that i will definitely though   get me some more and not burn it this time   tha  bomb  this is some weird looking  yet   tasty stuff   ,1,0
4583,i absolutely love matouk s west indian hot sauce  it s got the spice and the flavor  a great combination all around  i use it in everything i eat  however  amazon is tripping with the price  it went from  9 and change to  14 and change for a 26oz  and that is ridiculous  i m going to have my local market order some with the guarantee that i ll purchase  if you like spice  get this    great product  terrible price,1,0

4580,this is a hearty and flavorful tomato soup with a hint of parmesan   it contains 30  less sodium than their regular soups if you re a cheese lover  this soup has a robust cheese flavor  yummy this soup has no msg  and it is low in sodium   it has 1 2 cup of veggies per serving  and it is low in fat a serving size is one cup  and the can contains 2 servings   each serving is 80 cal  5 fat cal  1 g fat  480 g sodium  18 g carb  3 g fiber   1g soluable fiber  9 g sugar  and 3 g protein the ingredients include tomato puree  water tomato paste   water  tomatoes  onions  1 5  modified food starch  sugar  salt  parmesan cheese  part skim milk  cheese  cultures  salt  enzymes   potassium chloride  cream  parsley  butter  corn protein   hydorolized   maltodextrin  yeast extract  garlic powder  natural flavor  calcium chloride  spice oregano  sodium phosphate  citrus acid  and onion powder the allergy alert states that the soup may contain milk i also like this soup because the vendors state it has 2 1 cup servings which is 16 oz   this soup gives you 18 5 oz  of delicious soup this soup is made in the usa by general mills  inc   minneapolis  mn   the soup also has an expiration date stamped on the bottom of the can  progresso reduced sodium tomato parmesan soup   18 5 oz ,1,0
4579,this is rare find in gluten free cookies when it comes to flavor and texture   unfortunately rice based products tend to crumble and these cookies are no exception   mine were purchased locally and one third were broken   it is possible that better packing would reduce breakage as the current packing does not restrict movement of the cookies  worse  this packing does nothing to distribute g forces evenly across each cookie when the box is dropped   old style cookie tins have crinkled paper cups and shock absorbing corrugated cardboard   pamela needs to take advantage of our ever expanding knowledge of the physics of how things break   put another way  pamela s package is like a car with no seat belts  no airbags  no safety cage and no crumple zone  additional cost would be small in my opinion rice cookies made with honey or molasses hold up better as these sticky sweeteners have gluten s glue like binding power   it may not be possible to make shortbread cookies more durable while maintaining the excellent taste i cannot eat real shortbread so breakage is better than nothing  an excellent corn and gluten free cookie that does not hold up in shipment,1,0
4578,my grandson takes a 1oz  bag of pirates booty each day for lunch in school today he came home  grossed out  his words   because there was   a dark brown  hard as a rock  chunk of something  in his bag my explanation was that probably a piece of booty got caught in a machine  overcooked and the came loose and fell in his bag would appreciate it if you have another or better explanation  he is a picky eater at best  would be a shame to lose a reasonably healthy snack you need another  contact us  method  did not want to make this a review but could not find another way   usually he and his sister love your products  oh dear ,1,0

4552,these flavors are so realistic  the rotten egg and sprout flavors almost made me vomit  now when i think of the rotten egg  i feel dizzy  the cake  roasted marshmallow  and cherry ones are so good though  i would recomand this to anyone p s  try the black ones  eeewwww,1,0
4549,hi  i m not by nature a sardine lover  but for health reasons my husband   i started eating them regularly these are not too salty and taste so fresh   i really like them a lot   the only down side is the cost  at over  2 00 a can they are  sadly a little too pricey for us to eat every day  fresh taste  ,1,0
4528,the price of this food went up 3 50   on amazon over the past month  yikes  that said my cats love it  especially the persians  and it s the only food i ve found that doesn t make my extremely sensitive cat ill  i just buy it elsewhere since the price hike  great food  high price,1,0
4527,i really enjoy these energy shots  my husband has a bad reaction to sucralose and most energy shots have it in them but these don t  they really do give me several hours of energy without a crash and i feel great  the only thing i don t like about them is the taste  if you ve ever had a glucose test and they give you that nasty orange drink  that s what this tastes like  perhaps i ll try a different flavor next time  lots of energy  no crash but tastes bad ,1,0

4522,these are the best  i wish the company would care enough about their customers to make more of them   you would think since so many people keep requesting them that they would do something about it   actually  when a company doesn t honor the many requests for them to make them again  it really turns me off to keep supporting the company  so  i just won t buy their products any longer  too bad  but it is the only way to let them know we mean buisness  really  really  good wish the company would care enough about their customers to make more         ,1,0
4521,this product is great  with that said it would have to sell for  22 80 per 12 pack to make it worth while to buy  i can get these all day long for  2 00 per can  that would put a 12 pack at  24 00 and that still wouldn t get me to bite  fix the price  and sell this stuff   too expensive ,1,0
4520,this is much better for you than regular gum  no toxic artificial sweeteners  no sugar added to your system  it is made with stevia thus is natural and not harmful  for a review of toxic additives  here is that listing       natural with no toxic additives,1,0
4529,i completely agree with some of the other reviewers here  i ordered mine along with several other items at the same time and didn t realize how poorly they were going to be packaged until i got my box with 2 of the 3 umeboshi paste packages damaged and leaking everywhere  amazon shipped this delicate item in a large box along with over 4 pounds of backing flours  what was the thinking amazon     thankfully  they refunded me entirely for the damaged products which had to be thrown out for fear of contamination from other items in the box  next time though  i will definitely not have these shipped with anything else since this is a review of the product  i will say that the product itself is very good and very useful in a lot of vegan gluten free baking  this is all i ever use it for anyway and a little goes a long way  do not have this shipped with heavy items ,1,0

4517,they are oats  wheat  rye  and barley  in other words  they do seed if allowed to mature before getting killed by cats  since i do have a backyard with space to plant  i plant seeds in soil  it takes about 4 months to complete their life cycle  during their growth  i only pick off tips of the leaves so they could still continue to grow  only the last few days of seed maturing the leaves turn dry and yellow and are not edible  in return  i could get seeds  for free  to plant right away  as long as the weather allows it i don t use any pest control or use any fertilizer  so certainly not all of the seeds would survive  aphids  with the help of ants  and snails do invade  and a slight strong gust could break their fragile stems  however  i could be sure that they are certainly organic through out the process  and the source of grass would not die down during the months they grow notes  remember to wash before feeding to cats  and certainly don t pick off parts that had been bitten by aphids or crawled by snails  this is how i plant them,1,0
4516,hi  i have been drinking sobe all flavors about 3 months now   i love them  but the price has gone up   public this week priced them at 1 49 per bottle and walmart last week   1 18   i had been paying 1 00 at publix   so now i am making my own water   lemon and lime juice   too bad  but most retirees just can t afford these prices anymore  the rents too high,1,0
4515,i bought this product with hesitation after the last reviewer mentioned the odd consistency but i can honestly say i had no problems whatsoever   it is a good product  comes with the pump and is probably as good as you get from the major coffee shops   it is really thick but i chalk that up to it being real vanilla and not synthetic   i am 1 3 through the bottle and will probably buy again  really thick but good product,1,0

4512,in fact before ordering it online through amazon the only time i could find this coffee was served at the fitz on freemont the plaza at the end of freemont or the now closed sahara on my trips to vegas how good is the coffee the one place in hawaii that sold douwe egberts was a commercial beverage place and the frozen concentrate that goes into a commercial coffee dispenser like the ones the casino uses would have cost me  240   and i was gonna buy it until i notice it was kona blend istead of filter blend  kona has that  coffee ash  after taste starbuck s is so fond of sticking in all their blends as a  flavor   blech luckily i found filter blend here and been ordering it ever sincee i d travel to vegas for a douwe  egbert s,1,0
4511,these noodles have no calories  quite a bit is written about how terrible they smell  frankly  it is true  however  it is easily dealt with  i open up the bag  drain the noodles in a strainer  and continue to soak the noodles in warm water from the tap for some 30 minutes or so  they are great for use in soups  they also work well in any situation where there will be a strongly flavored sauce  they do not tend to take up the taste of the sauce they are cooked in  to be quite honest  if i had a choice between these and the regular vietnamese rice noodle i would certainly eat the regular vietnamese noodle however the calories and carbohydrates are not workable for me  the fact that these have insignificant calories and carbohydrates trumps any minor problems i have with taste and texture you should be aware that these are available from local stores for quite a bit less  i bought 20 bags of these yesterday from my local asian store in a small to medium town for 2 dollars and 15 cents per bag  great product  terrible price ,1,0
4510,i work at a grocery store and we just barely started carrying the blk water   after seeing several people buying it the past couple weeks  i decided i had to get one and try it   i was totally expecting it to have some kind of bitter taste or something just because of how black the water was   i have to say though  it doesn t taste bad at all  it tastes just like tap water   it has a very slight metallic taste to it if you try to pick a flavor out  but other than that it s not anymore noticeable than the water you get out of the faucet  and we have pretty good water in our city    i don t know what kind of water these other reviewers were drinking because their descriptions of how awful and nasty the blk water is are way exaggerated   i think they were going for more of a shock factor than being realistic  doesn t taste bad at all   these other people are crazy,1,0

4530,well  what else am i going to say to fill up 20 words   it s a bit expensive  but worth it for the lack of salt   for some reason i just recently realized the kind you buy in the grocery store does have salt in it  tastes great  no salt,1,0

4545,this is truly a good coffee for those bothered by the acid in standard coffee  this one also does not have a decaf after  taste  either  the reason i gave it a 4 star was that it was not robust in flavor  but one shouldn t expect that with the lower acid decaf combo  good  does what it supposed to,1,0

4531,i read a review that said some will have almost no flavor and some will have a lot  this hit the nail on the head  grab a handful and eat them one at a time  some are bland like a cheerio and some are almost sour  like jarred banana baby food is  that being said  flavor is not much of an issue  i don t see parents lining up to eat their kid s pureed peas  it s about what is better  i really don t like any food going into my baby s system that has a paragraph long list of ingredients that sound more like a science experiment with a recipe  but i feel better about these puffs than the gerber ones  also  i bought this at target instead of from amazon  satisfied ,1,0
4541,since personally i cannot read what this package really says  i was curious to try them  i had received a couple of these at work and was curious if they tasted like flowers or not  so i ordered my own bag  well when i got my bag of candy  i popped one in my mouth  the taste is very good  candy is shaped like a flower  so i m guessing that is where the flower part comes into play  flower tasting or not  very satisfied with this candy  kasugai candy,1,0

4536,i love the concept and look of this stuff but my advice is to use less than suggested    at least the first time when you can decide for yourself   suggested conversion from liquid vanilla is exactly the same  1 tsp liquid vanilla to 1 tsp vanilla bean paste  which i did for a favorite cheesecake squares recipe and it was too much  too much vanilla can be too much ,1,0
4535,i bought a box of this at whole foods and really liked it  i had it with organic milk  with almond milk  with added cocoa powder  all sorts of ways  and it was just a nice  sounder version of the rice krispies i had as a kid  i will note it is grittier than r k   but that s cause it s simpler  not a long list of ingredients  and uses brown rice  it doesn t stay crispy as long as traditional r k   so only pour your milk almond milk soymilk etc when you re ready to chow down for folks avoiding gluten  but not low carb  obviously   this is a nice cereal for when one wants something other than eggs  i find it s really nice with a sprinkle of real cocoa powder  sans sugar  if you have celiac disease  heed the warnings you see here from others  i m gluten sensitive  not celiac  and i didn t detect any issues after eating this i will not that the only reason i didn t buy it here  from amazon  is that 6 boxes is just too much  i have nowhere to store that much cereal  and i don t like cereal getting stale  laying around  i m the only one in the house who eats this  hubby hates unsweetened cereal   so six boxes is excessive for me  if it were a two pack  yeah  i would have  really nice  healthier version of rice krispies  great for those avoiding gluten  though celiac disease folk may need to beware ,1,0
4534,i like that you can brew it in cold water  although it s stronger in hot   i also liked that it s unsmoked   i was reading that some of the rumors small studies that show mate might be mildly carcinogenic were done on smoked mate  which caused me to look for unsmoked and find this   it doesn t taste the same as smoked  understandably  but it tastes good  tasty stuff,1,0

4271,for years  the only lu s i could find at my local market were the usa lu s  which aren t as good as the belgium biscuits   so  i was happy to find them at amazon this past july  2012 and bought the case of six boxes   unfortunately  they didn t taste fresh and had an expiration date of dec  2012  that explained the stale taste  but i chose not to return them   instead  i nuke two in the microwave for 5 or 6 seconds and it sort of revives the flavor well  last week  sept  14  2012  i found the belgium lu at my local supermarket and bought a single box   that box expires dec  2013  over a year from now  and the cookies definitely taste better   moral of the story  buy them where you can read the expiration date   i surmise that having a year or two shelf life should be about right  buy them off the shelf,1,0

4268,i go into anaphylaxis after ingesting corn    in any form  to my dismay  corn is in just about every brand of baking powder that i searched out  this stuff though       nope  no corn  yes  i am also celiac  so i can t have gluten  a good leavening is necessary when one is baking without gluten  ener g has been the ticket  i am so grateful for this brand of baking powder  it is only a single acting powder rather than the usual double acting  but i haven t had any problems with this  finally   ,1,0
4266,anyone who makes their own spaghetti sauce will like these  just the right size for one recipe  unlike some other reviews  these are whole and have to be mashed up  i am not a fan of anchovies  but these did impart a noticeable but not overpowering anchovie taste to the sauce  a lot of taste in a small container,1,0
4275,the 46 oz canned roland grapefruit sections taste almost like fresh  very good product  i would like to order more  but the packaging was absolutely horrible     there were cans rolling around in a box much too large for the number of cans and there was virtually no packing material in the box   the result was that out of 8 or so cans in the box 7 out of the 8 were so bent on both ends that you cannot use a can opener to completely remove the lid without a lot of stops and starts   where the item says the product is in a 4 pack  they are not in a box containing the 4 pack   what they actually mean is that 4 46 oz cans are inserted into a light weight plastic bag and then thrown into a large box that would easily hold 24 cans and is too light weight to support the weight of the cans  then throw in a little packing and put 1 piece of tape on the top  the tape was actually broken on a box with nothing to hold the cans in the box and because of the rolling around in the box  the cans were no longer in the plastic bag   very good product that you cannot find elsewhere  but beware of the packing  good product   bad shipment packaging,1,0
4265,i was really hoping these would be like j j snack foods  banana chocolate chunk benefit bars  which are only available to school food service and not retail   but they are not  they are tasty though  with a slightly burnt taste  which i figure has something to do with the dried pumpkin in the ingredient list  they are soft  with a little crunch  excellent bars,1,0
4263,on sept 12 i posted the following seller review   3 5 stars    i m sorry to say that this item arrived with some slight cosmetic damage  on the top front edge of the rack there is what i would call a dent  but it s also rough  from the way it was packaged i would have to say that it was that way when it was put into the box  i intended this as a gift  and i don t have time to return it  so i ll just try to sand it down so it s at least smooth    jammies  september 12  2012later amazon added   message from amazon   this item was fulfilled by amazon  and we take responsibility for this fulfillment experience  shortly after i posted it  i received an email from the spice lab inc  offering to send a new block  i sent them a couple of pictures of the damaged area  they sent me a new block and two little spoons to replace the one that was missing from my original order  the replacement block arrived yesterday in plenty of time for my trip to visit my son and daughter in law in hindsight  i should have contacted the spice lab before i posted the review  so they could have had time to resolve the problem  i had jumped to the conclusion that i d need to return the item in order to get a replacement  which wasn t the case since it s a gift  i can t speak to the quality of the salt  but i can say that the block is very sturdy and attractive  and the little spoon is a charming addition i greatly appreciate the efforts of brett at the spice lab  and i would happily buy from them again  review correction,1,0

4260,this is my second box of these creamers   the first ones  ordered about 9 months ago  were great and did not cause me any gastrointestinal discomfort   but after receiving this latest shipment a few weeks ago and after a couple days of having my morning coffee with two of these creamers  i noticed that i was having pronounced symptoms of having ingested dairy   i guess it was my mistake in thinking that all coffee mate products were non dairy   i looked again at the label on these and it plainly says  contains milk ingredients   so even though the product description says  lactose free   it isn t   i can t understand why the last box of these didn t bother me   maybe something changed with the formulation   but i won t be ordering these anymore   i m still giving the product 4 stars because it s a good creamer if you can tolerate dairy   but if i could tolerate dairy i would ve just bought creamers at the grocery store    lactose intolerant folks  beware ,1,0

4258,i wasn t expecting anything from this stuff   i thought it would be all after taste  but what the heck   that 5 hour energy crap tastes horrible and never gave me any energy  so it was a waste   i bought the mio green thunder  added to powerade zero lemon lime  and wow   no calories and it tastes incredible   i thought the powerade zero tasted pretty good on it s own  but now i can t believe there s no calories in my new favorite drink combo mio is awesome on it s own with good water  i like this flavor mainly due to the sour factor   i probably use more than most per fl oz of water   i love sour stuff and this hits the spot  try adding to powerade zero lemon lime,1,0

4255,i read some of the reviews on here and i almost didn t purchase   but i reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule  trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments  my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration   so i bit the bullet and purchased this at a local b m store   when i got home after work  i boiled some water and opened the package   i noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so i guess it did has a pungent smell   i opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff   i was kind of disappointed   it doesn t smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me   yes i will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me   to me  smells like this health food store i used to frequent in the hyde park neighborhood   very musky but weirdly comforting   i have tried it with peppermint  turmeric  for a different affliction  and i have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me   i wouldn t say i have an iron stomach because i can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature   for me  this product took about two days for it to kick in and i am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here  wake up for about two hours  sleep for three  wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours   for those with sensitive noses and sense of taste  you have been amply warned by other reviewers   for others  i say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit   there are some great suggestions mentioned by other reviewers  like mint for example  it works for me and that is all i care about,1,0
4276,i accidentally bought this smaller size  but it s actually better for milk because you have to use what you thaw   so filling up the 8 oz milk bag and you have a lot of milk for baby   i ve been freezing and thawing and have used about 20 of these bags so far and no leaks or holes   freeze them flat then stack them together   be careful the condensation may case bags to freeze together   even so  i ve found that pulling them apart has not created any leaks  these 4 oz bags are better size for milk than the larger bags,1,0

4298,i just called customer service at jel sert  the company that makes this product  snapple customer service told me that they only make the liquid teas  and the customer service agent told me that each serving of diet snapple singles has 16 mg of caffeine   a pouch has 2 servings  so a pouch has 32mg of caffeine total   i was looking all over for this information so i wanted to publish it for other people who are looking i like the taste of this  although i do like the taste of the bottled diet peach snapple a little better   but this is a lot cheaper  so it s worth the trade off   i generally put one pouch in 24oz of water  otherwise it is too strong for me  caffeine content  32mg per pouch,1,0

4289,after learning about kopi luwak from the bucket list  i ve been wanting to try some but never could bring myself to try it due to the cost and the fact that it s been in and out of an animal   but when i found a friend who was willing to try it with me  i figured  how bad could this be   granted  this was an expensive experiment but it s a once thing so the  50 was well spent in that sense we both like strong coffee and this was certainly strong   a 100gm bag was more than enough for a 10 cup pot with some leftover   it didn t smell any different nor did it taste any different  unfortunately    mind you  i m not comparing this to stuff like folgers or starbucks   i m comparing it to the malaysian coffee i m used to    it was strong but smooth   it didn t have the  rancid  taste  not sure if i m explaining the taste correctly  that some cheaper coffee tend to have and neither did it have a charred flavor like burnt beans   unfortunately  it still had a hint of bitterness toward the end of the sip   i tried it black at first to experience the taste unadulterated by anything but couldn t stand it    i never could drink black coffee anyway    a packet of sugar made it pleasant but still retain its coffee ness as an experiment  it was worth it  albeit a little expensive   i don t think i ll be purchasing more of this   it s an ok coffee   i would drink it if presented with it but i won t go out of my way to get it   just a little too expensive for everyday drinking   i ll stick to my malaysian coffee   sweet  smooth  and buttery  almost  smooth but a little too expensive for everyday consumption,1,0

4223,after not having a s more in 16 years  i was beyond excited to find marshmallows that i can eat    i don t eat gelatin    i waited in anticipation to get these and they just arrived   before i even opened the package  the disappointment began   the marshmallows came in a bubble envelope   not a box  an envelope   so i was prepared for them to be a bit squished   then  upon opening the envelope  i discovered that they weren t as squished as they had appeared from the outside   the flatness of the package was mainly due to these marshmallows being super tiny   i m going to need at least 6 to make a s more so even after all of that  i ll still give them a 4 star rating because they really do have the consistency of a  real  marshmallow   my husband couldn t tell the difference   the price is a bit ridiculous as well  but i decided to go for it since it had been so long since my last marshmallow experience   i ll update later after my s more attempt update   they roast just like regular marshmallows   awesome   we used 3 4 marshmallows per s more  so tiny ,1,0
4221,i can t do artificial sweeteners for medical reasons  add that monsanto is behind aspartame s original push through the fda without the added testing the fda wanted     and i m all in for this stuff   it does have a  twang  of stevia aftertaste  but i add about 1 2 teaspoon of agave nectar  i use raspberry flavored in this   and it kills the twang with only about 10 extra calories   that s not bad for 16 ounces of a good tasting drink      naturally  sweetened very low calorie drink mix,1,0
4220,doesn t taste as good as real peanut butter of course  but the small amount of flavor lost is worth the trade off considering how much healthier it is   the texture consistency is also pretty much the same as normal pb once mixed   if you just care about calories fat and not so much about sodium  adding salt makes it taste a lot better  decent taste  great health,1,0
4219,product taste as expected but of the 12 cans that was ordered   3 cans were extremely dented and 6 with some dents on the cans   i will have to throw out the extremely dented cans as i am not sure when the cans were dented   not safe  dented cans   ,1,0
4227,this tastes lovely in terms of spices  but there is absolutely no pumpkin to this  it isn t sweet  either  i currently am mixing this syrup with some sugar free vanilla i picked up today and that is making it better     but still not what i expected  i would still be willing to try other flavors  though  someone said it tastes like those red hot cinnamon candies  that seems very accurate  only not as intense as mentioned in another review  mine didn t have any kind of seal on it other than the twist off cap  but it did sound sealed  so i suppose it is safe good thing  it came with a pump i would say this is likely best used in tandem with either a basic sweetener vanilla pumpkin pie syrup because this by itself isn t what you re looking for    edit 22 september 2012     upgrade from 2 to 4 starsas another reviewer mentioned  the next business day after i made this review i got a phone call from paul  owner of amoretti  we talked about their products  the syrups in particular of course  apparently people either love or hate this one  not much in between  he made the point that none of the syrups are very sweet or sugary  which is what led me to buy this instead of pumpkin pie  worrying it would be too sweet  and don t even use artificial sweeteners  he asked if he could send me the pumpkin pie flavor and some other goodies  which i felt bad for accepting  but i am glad i did he sent  overnight  three full size bottles of syrups  pumpkin pie  violet lavender  and crema di vanilla   a mini sampler of their three olive oils  and two samplers of martini mixes absolutely astounding customer service  just     i am still gobsmacked  if i could rate just the company from 1 5 stars  i d give them a 20 i have used the pumpkin spice a few more times since i wrote the original review above and still am not a big fan of it  though i think i can definitely find some uses for it  it seems like it would be best not as a base flavoring  if that makes sense  but to use more like a quarter to half a pump at the very most to add just a touch more spice to a drink all the syrups are quite concentrated  so that doesn t necessarily work in favor of a spice flavor  because you think oh  it needs more sweetness  i ll add more  do not do that  it will make it taste terrible  definitely stick with the reccommendations of how much to use in a hot or cold drink on the back of the bottle  each pump of syrup has 4g of sugar so adding more syrup isn t going to help  that was  admittedly  a mistake i had made with the pumpkin spice also  for either the pumpkin pie or the pumpkin spice  consider getting the crema di vanilla and putting a quarter to half a pump in your drink  it s like putting the whipped cream on your pumpkin pie  absolutely amazing i may update this again if i can find a way to truly enjoy the pumpkin spice flavor  but everything else seems amazing and you cannot find better customer service anywhere  they really take your input into consideration and want feedback  this brand is definitely worth the money thank you  paul  never buying another brand  again  all spice  no pumpkin,1,0

4213,this review is mostly about installation issues   the target is a raccoon who s been laying waste to my small pond the included fence posts  just plastic stakes  are a problem if you have to drive them through anything but the softest dirt   i had better luck using 3 4 inch schedule 40 plastic pipe  cutting several lengths about six inches to a foot long  and driving the pipe sections into the dirt until only about an inch or so sticks out   once this is done  the pre drilled plastic stake drops neatly into the pipe end   you might have to use a hose to flush some dirt out of the inside of the plastic pipe this also makes it easy to remove small installations around a garden or pond or something  since once you ve discouraged the animal you can just lift the stakes out of the pipes  roll everything up  and put it away until you need it again the box that generates the voltage is not weatherproof  which would have been nice  but i expect it would have added to the price   unless you have a sheltered area right near your installation  you ll need an electrical outdoor junction box or something to protect that box   my junction box cost about 35 bucks  a wiegmann 8x8x4 outdoor enclosure i m going to add an on off switch in its own enclosure box  and a photocell to turn the thing off when daylight comes   i don t trust myself to remember to disconnect it every morning  and i ve got nothing against squirrels  good product for the price   some installation issues ,1,0

4246,those little pantry pests come in with organic foods from just about every supplier   at least the food won t poison them so maybe not us either  that s why i buy organic but these little moths really are a pest  and difficult to rid from your pantry or even the rest of your home i date put these traps out whenever i see those little pests fluttering around   often the traps will be loaded within a month or two   and in general i make sure there are at least a few  current traps around my home at all times   they do work  pantry pests caught in the trap ,1,0
4245,i ordered during labor day weekend  and immediately sent email to  seller contact  with list of k cup flavors   unfortunately  the email went to the wrong vendor  i still don t understand why    the next day i received an email from the correct vendor requesting list of flavors   i sent the information again  and the vendor assembled my order and mailed that same day   vendor was exceptionally understanding and responsive to the email snafu   order was received exactly as requested   i highly recommend this seller   i am now enjoying different flavors everyday to determine which i would buy in quantities  outstanding service ,1,0
4243,this cereal has sprouted grain healthy ingredients and i also like the taste  i also trust this company s philosophy of being inspired by an old time ezekiel recipe for their products  recommend this good quality product to fellow shoppers  i like this cereal,1,0
4242,i concur with the majority of the reviews here  my dog seems to quite like this food  it feels a bit moist  looks somewhat colorful  and even smells a bit of beef  in other words  it certainly comes across as good quality dog food  however  it s worth noting that the ingredients seem to be somewhat of a mixed bag beef is the most prevalent ingredient  which indicates a slightly higher quality of product  look at the labels of many other bags of dog food  and you ll see that the first ingredient is usually some filler    unfortunately  fillers seem to take up several of the succeeding slots on the ingredients list of this chef michael s product  so it s certainly not the highest quality you ll find  but it s definitely not the worst either bottom line  my guess is that it seems to be a bit higher quality than your average bag of dog food  and that makes it a bargain for the price  you could do better if you re willing to pay for it  but i think this food will do well for most dog owners  it will certainly do for most,1,0

4241,i bought this at my local health food store some time ago because it was on sale after tasting it  i understand why it was 50  off ugh it has a somewhat bitter aftertaste which you can avoid by just using less  of course  using less  would defeat the purpose of using a sweetener in the first place  wouldn t it  this stuff also made me gaseous i will  however  use up the box because i must admit  this is not the worst stevia i ve ever tasted  some stevias i ve tried were so nasty  i had to throw them away at this point  i ve not found a stevia that actually tastes like sugar my search  for a sugar replacement  continues edit  9 18 12i ve been using this product for about a month  but recently started using it on a regular basis  thus my review above   i just discovered something which may interest those of you reading this review   this product contains  inulin   which is a soluble fiber   how convenient is that   fiber in a sweetner    edit  9 21 12i am upgrading this product from 3 stars to 5   i m using more sweet leaf instead of less to get the sugary flavor i love   once you get used to the aftertaste  which is not as bitter as others   this is actually a great stevia i will repurchase  does all stevia have a bitter aftertaste ,1,0
4239,i guess i expected a spicier mix of spices  but this just smells tastes like spiced nutmeg  but maybe that s what garam masala is supposed to taste like  in any case  i made a korma with this and other spices and it turned out ok  better than it had before without it  so i can t really complain too much  the korma just tasted a little too sweet  even with sour cream and garlic  and added black pepper and salt because it tasted bland  someone should just make a powdered spice for korma  because i can t seem to get it right  very nutmeg y,1,0

4236,so basically  i like to go to dunkin donuts and get a vanilla chai on occasion and when the random outing with friends or family brings me to starbucks  i like to get a chai latte there  i m a college kid and being a smart person who likes tea failed to get a kettle and wanted a mix that could easily be thrown into water boiled in the microwave  no messing with tea leaves  no adding sugar i got this one and the vanilla chai and this one  is  amazing  not too sweet and is more flavorful than the vanilla  i daresay better than starbucks and for the price and convenience  gives dunkin donuts a run for its money  i d totally get this again  uhm yes ,1,0

4232,first of all i am giving this 5 stars because it is a pretty good tasting soup  but this soup is not for vegans  some of you commented that this was vegan  but it is not  here are the ingredients  taken from progresso com  water  potatoes  tomato puree  water  tomato paste   tomatoes  carrots  celery  corn  dark red kidney beans  green beans  onions  contains less than 2  of  modified food starch  sugar  celery juice concentrate  sea salt  potassium chloride  onion powder  garlic powder  dextrose  corn protein  hydrolyzed   salt  citric acid  natural flavor  yeast extract  dried parsley  spice  beet powder  color   calcium chloride  carrot juice concentrate  onion juice  bell pepper juice concentrate  sodium phosphate  corn syrup  egg yolk powder  soy lecithin  caramel color  milk  freshness preserved by potassium sorbate progresso makes no claim that this soup is vegan  amazon should have provided the list of ingredients  but they didn t  so  if you re vegetarian or eat meat  you re fine  if you re vegan  like me  since august 3  2012   look elsewhere  it s too bad that progresso insists on adding eggs and dairy to their vegetable soups  my favorite was the low sodium minestrone  but it also has egg and dairy products  good for vegetarians   omnivores  not for vegans ,1,0

4381,i have been drinking filtered water for many years  ever since i was young i remember growing up drinking distilled water because my uncle had sold my parents a distiller  since then i have learned that the mineral content of the water is very important and also lends to a more smooth and refreshing drink  if any of you have tasted distilled water then you know what i mean when i moved out and purchased my own house  i installed an r o  filter under my kitchen sink and drank r o  water for several years  r o  water like distilled water has had most of the minerals removed during the filtration process  my local tap water has a ph of about 7 6 and a tds  total dissolved solids  average of about 356 ms  my own r o  water brought the conductivity down to around 30 ms and the ph to around 7 or slightly less   i currently use my ro filter along with a de ionizing filter afterwards to create ultra pure 0 ms tds water for my reef tank  i do not drink it i was introduced to  kangen  or  ionized alkaline water  while i was traveling in japan  it is water that has been filtered  usually thru a sediment  then a carbon block cartridge  and then run past energized platinum plates to create 2 water streams  one stream is acidic and one is alkaline  the acid water can be used to clean  water plants and put topically on the skin amongst its many uses  the alkaline water is what you drink  apparently during the ionizing process the water molecules are also altered  usually water clusters together in 12 or so molecule clusters  while ionized water has smaller clusters of around 6 8 molecules  supposedly this allows the water to cross the cell membranes in our bodies easier and promotes more rapid rehydration despite all the theories and studies  the real evidence for me is the way the water works for me  before drinking alkaline water i would get heartburn or acid reflux occasionally after a long day of hard work or after eating certain foods  after several months of drinking alkaline water i never got acid reflux  three years later since i first started drinking alkaline water i have only had acid reflux maybe twice  i would attribute that to the foods i ate that day and stressful work as well as not drinking the filtered water for several days prior  alkaline water has improved my health in my opinion and am still drinking and prefer it to any other drinks when i am thirsty  it hasn t however kept me from getting sick occasionally or making me look many years younger  it has overall generally improved my health and i do feel better drinking it on a daily basis since i own a several thousand dollar alkaline water ionizer filter and drink the water daily  own an r o  filter and water testing equipment and understand a moderate amount of water chemistry principles  i was very curious to try this bottled version of alkaline water and see how it compares it states on the label that the water has been r o  filtered  then minerals have been added back  it lists sodium bicarbonate  dipotassium phosphate  magnesium sulfate and calcium chloride  after the minerals have been added back then it is  alkalized and restructured using ionic separation technology  all of this sounds very familiar as this is exactly how alkaline water ionizers work  the water needs to have minerals added back to be able to ionize the water  here is what i discovered after trying a bottle taste  i like the taste of it  it s not bad  it s light and refreshing and very similar to my own alkaline water smell  clean  no noticeable  off  odors hydration ability  better than tap  but   nano clustered  water supposedly looses its smaller clustering formation over time measured in days  i wonder if the water is still structured the same by the time it gets to us to drink  didn t seem to refresh quite as well as freshly made alkaline water ph  label states a ph of 9 5 which is on par with my ionizer unit which can produce a range of ph strengths from 7 0 to 12 0 i usually drink alkaline water with a ph of 9 overall i like the water and would choose it first over any other bottled water at the connivence store  its benefits would be the fact that it is filtered  has a proper mineral content  unlike distilled and ro water only   and has an alkaline ph  it s limitations to me seem to be the age of it thus potentially losing its small water clustering  as well as the plastic bottle is comes in  many alkaline water aficionados recommend using glass containers first  stainless steel second and bpa free plastic third as the hierarchy of best water vessels to use  while not providing all the benefits of freshly made alkaline ionized water  it does provide a good many of them  currently a 12 pack of 1 5l bottles on amazon cost  28 75 and this translates to roughly  0 80 per 16 oz of water  which is not bad compared to  1 25 16 oz bottles at my local store  i think the 1 5 liter is a good size and a good quantity of water to drink per day of this water for most people  that amount to  2 40 per 1 5l bottle  i make my own for pennies on the dollar  but when including the initial investment of purchasing the ionizer along with replacement filter costs  buying these bottles will be cheaper for a long payback period  however if getting the absolute full benefits of alkaline ionized water is very important  you may want to consider purchasing an ionizing unit  these also would be a good way to test drinking this type of water before purchasing your own unit  in conclusion i think essentia water is making a very good attempt to bring the benefits of alkaline ionized water to more people and i would purchase it over any other bottled waters  all water is not the same imo,1,0
4380,my dog loves these rawhide bones  he s a black lab mix and it takes him a an hour and a half of pure chewing to get through one  you can tell that the bones are quality rawhide and thoroughly pressed  always a plus  the only thing i didn t like was that each bone had a tag  a small issue  but only takes two seconds to take all of them off   just silly to waste paper i guess  in total  these bones are worth it and will not break into little pieces on the floor  i will certainly buy these again in the future  love compressed rawhide ,1,0
4378,basically  the taste of this cereal is remarkably like grape nuts  which i have and still do like also   the difference is there s no risk of an emergency dental call with the ezekiel cereal  which is not nearly as hard as grape nuts  ezekiel will also satisfy those who mandate organic ingredients  etc sprouted grain products are truly tasty and deserve to be more familiar to more people  they put refined grains  i  e   white flour  to shame nutritionally and unsprouted whole grains  i  e   whole wheat  to shame in terms of taste texture  it s more expensive  but buy a box to sample first and then buy bulk afterwards  as i have  expensive but unique food,1,0
4377,tried the jackpot     very good quality   found the portion smaller than if i had i poured my own helping of quaker oats from the tub   maybe that is why i m over weight the disapointment was no price break to my local coffee shop where i purchased the different flavors to experiment   very good quality though   i am willing to pay for quality but if i take the retailer out of the equation  i expect a bigger price break at amazon    very good but   ,1,0
4376,1am  downtown going away house party  i ve been here for hours and i m starting to lose energy but the fun is only just starting   what to do     so i drank a 5 hour energy and never gave my tiredness a second thought  i felt naturally alert and energized like the night had just began  if i had chosen an energy drink instead  i would have felt jittery and bloated due to the carbonation in the drink  just a little sip is all i needed  i would definitely buy this again   fyi  i also snacked on a banana at the same time   i think the two together really gave me the shot of energy so i would suggest hungry 5 hour energy fans to try this healthy snack along with the drink i received a free sample of 5 hour energy from smiley360  best tasting one yet ,1,0

4382,this  creamy bacon   in my opinion  is one of the best walden farms dressings  it is thick and has a good bacon taste  another rater mentioned that if you like vinegar dressings  you will like this  i guess that s true  because i like to cut this dressing with organic apple cider vinegar and liquid zero calorie sweetener  which makes a nice sweet bacon vinaigrette dressing   that reduces my sodium intake  even so  it just as much straight from the bottle  the only other flavor or dressing i like nearly as much is the balsamic vinaigrette one  i thought this was creamy bacon dressing  so the review belongs with that flavor  not bacon ranch  sorry  a favorite ,1,0

4384,a      i have been using click espresso protein drink with pb2 for over a week now   before purchasing i had been using another whey protein powder that was not very tasty  but none of them ever are  they are just a recovery drink for after i run  so  i was curious to see if this one would be any different as so many were saying they are right  it has a wonderful strong coffee taste  not bitter  no aftertaste and i had no problems with mixing it in the click shaker that i purchased with this   i like the size of the click shaker  its small   measures easily   my other shaker for the health food store is too big  i m not sure why others say it doesn t mix well  since i had no problems   i did try to put it in my coffee to see how it would taste   it was a no go  it did not mix in hot coffee very well  but then again  that s not what it s meant for  i do use room temp bottled water when mixing  as i am a freak of nature   do not care for cold water  but  for the review  i chilled after mixing   it stayed mixed up and maintained it s great flavor  if you add pb2 expected very small  nutty  residue to remain from the pb2 and not from the click  this is not an issue  just worth mentioning energy rush is not so prevalent for me  but i can see where someone could be speeded up with this drink  so if you high blood pressure i do not recommend this  i do not recommend this for kids or teens because of that fact  i just like the good coffee taste in my protein drink  i do recommend the pb2 for a healthy additive to this protein drink as well  click espresso protein drink,1,0

4391,i bought this product after i ate a sample bite from a friend  i thought it was going to taste horrible  but to my surprise it was rather delicious  the texture and taste fits the 3 for  4 price  it was on sale  that i paid at a local storefront  the rich organic ingredients made the two cups enough for a single sitting treat the font size on the nutrition facts is rather small  i couldn t read the calories count or the sugar grams  l couldn t tell if it says 100 or 200 calories per servings  usda organicmade in           it just states distributed by      an organic treat,1,0
4390,gotta keep your expectations in check  like all low carb foods  but these are very decent tortillas  flavor is on the whole grainy side  but nothing too awful  they work great in wraps  for large tacos or you can crisp them for taco salad shells  my preferred use is to crisp them for a low carb pizza crust  which works very well if you enjoy a cracker thin crust and can trick yourself into believing it tastes remotely the same  without these  i d be a sad  sad guy  watching people eat their pizza while i eat a salad with pepperoni  now i can stand tall and pretend a tortilla with cheese and pepperoni is a slice of pizza  very good tortillas for low carb,1,0
4389,for store bought pad thai sauce  this isn t terrible   restaurants have a variety of styles  so it s hard to be  authentic  to what most americans expect  but this has all the major themes   i have yet to see another storebought sauce that contains all of the following  tamarind  dried shrimp  fish sauce  and fresh chili paste   this does   most others are a combination of high fructose corn syrup and vinegar   if you want higher quality product than this  i d skip directly to making your own from scratch and check out chez pim s pad thai recipe   also  don t be shy with the oil  decent,1,0

4386,i work nights and sleep during the day  this door allows my dogs to go outside and back in on their own    thus  no more lost sleep letting them out  it also keeps other unwanted critters out  you would not want a skunk or raccoon following them back in  trust me on this    ive been there    the door is a bit pricey but in my opinion well worth the price  you wont be disappointed             high tech ,1,0
4394,with all the hoopla  i decided to give this a try  without any great expectations  i was expecting this to be very bland  but surprisingly it wasn t   i thought it was pretty medium in taste and not bad at all  not bad ,1,0
4357,bottled water to me always seemed like a gimmick   i grew up on tap water  unfiltered  straight from the hose or sink  and didn t mind it at all   as i grew older i wanted the mineral taste to the water that you find in tap water  and spring water just seemed so bland and boring that the only time i ever actually liked drinking it was when i had run a marathon and was exhausted and any water would do   even now i bring bottled water to work  quickly finish it  and then drink tap water for the rest of the day   i don t understand why people bring gallons of bottled water to work or the gym  or bring 4 16 oz  bottled water with them   made no sense with essentia i think i may have been turned   maybe it is the ph balance  but whatever they did to the water i absolutely love   crisp and fresh tasting  more so than normal bottled water   i can see myself purchasing this and keeping it stocked   they do come in rather large size bottles   the one i had was 1 5 liters  but you receive 12 of them for around  28  which comes to a comparison shop of a little under a  1 per 16 oz  bottle   from someone who doesn t like bottled water  i did enjoy this one quite a bit 5 stars  from someone who doesn t like bottled water  i enjoyed essentia quite a bit   ,1,0
4356,ok  the idea of frozen lobster bisque is a bit iffy  however  this was not bad at all  it is not the greatest lobster bisque i have ever had  but it is downright solid  and for frozen  hey  big plus points there  it tastes like real lobster meat  and  while not exactly generous in their portions of lobster meat  they most certainly do not skimp on it  it is a little less creamy and zesty than i am accustomed to  but again its not bad by any stretch of the imagination  i will be buying more of it for sure  better than you think,1,0

4322,my wife and i are picky about mayonnaise and have been hellmann s loyalists for over a decade now   however  after seeing that this product was top rated we decided to give it a shot via amazon  since this is not sold in the northeast    the price was very good   including shipping  so it was not a big risk on our part had we not liked the product well my wife was sold after one taste  while i waited a bit before making my vote   but there is no denying it  this is a better product note   we have ordered this twice through amazon now  and each time the expiration date of the product was over a year out   so they are not shipping items on the verge of expiration   4 containers still too much for you   find a friend and split a 4 pack  won us over ,1,0

4318,our son  since he was born  has had really tough problems with gerd  spit up  etc   it s made the little guy pretty miserable   his doctor suggested that we switch to a formula especially designed to address spit up issues   although he says  and i m sure he s right  that similac and enfamil are basically identical  and interchangeable  at least in our household they re not   my son will not drink enfamil at all  but is perfectly happy with the similac   we had no trouble switching from similac advance to this formulation  he sucked it right down  unlike the enfamil  which  even when he was really hungry  he refused to eat and  not only does he eat it  it works   we were really surprised at how much of a difference it made  and how quickly   he did have some difficulty at first  because he d gotten used to eating so much more formula  he spit up so much before  that a lot of his eating was playing  catch up    so we had a few  i ate too much  episodes  but then he started feeling much better and settled into a more predictable eating pattern   he still does spit up  but it s nowhere near as bad as it was   he used to have these fountains of vomit  and now it s just the occasional  small  vomit bubble  it really works ,1,0
4317,if you have never tried durian and are curious  these freeze dried pieces don t smell too bad    not as bad as durian jam    but they don t taste good either  the texture of of durian is one of the nice things about it  and it s lost when dried  these taste like dried dirty old gym socks  not too bad,1,0
4325,purchased a bonsai that arrived a couple of days later than described however  shipping delays are understandable and not always the fault of the shipper   the product did not match the description  however  the upon phone call the gentleman i spoke with informed me that the bonsai would change colors and eventually be the color that the description listed   after a month the color has started to slowly change   overall i am happy with their customer service and assistance  however  the description listed should have explained that the expected product would not be received and that the color would change after some time  not quite as expected,1,0

4315,i put a line of this stuff around my yard  it covered the half of my yard  going down border  that i have problems with neighbor dogs    the stuff is easy to pour and you can easily walk around and sprinkle the stuff around   i have not seen any animals in my yard  main concern is dogs   and when i see dogs running around i do not see them coming into my yard   my only thing to note  is that dogs seem to hate this stuff   we put it around our yard  and dogs in a nearby fence  about 10 feet away   started growling and barking and baring there teeth as we put the stuff around   so be careful if you do it near a dog  as they seem to get very violent toward you when you have this stuff out in the end this seems to work and covers a pretty good amount of coverage  however  dogs seem to hate it so hopefully that will mean they will stay away and out of my yard  seems to work,1,0
4326,crunchy carrots contain   organic carrot  organic maltodextrin and lecithin hearty sweet potatoes contain   organic sweet potatoes  organic maltodextrin  organic corn starch  sunflower lecithin plump peas and crunchy apples contain   100  peas and 100  apples the peas and the apples were the first products i tried from this company   the baby loved them and i loved the ingredients   i thought i would try the other products so i ordered the carrots and sweet potatoes   to my surprise and disappoinment  when they arrived  i saw that they contained ingredients that i was not pleased with   i wrote nurturme and asked why they put maltodextrin in their products unnecessarily and they responded  the organic maltodexrin in our products is derived form organic corn   maltodextrins are manufactured form starch and are extensively used as an emulsifier in foods they are included in our foods because they are binding agents that are used when our foods are dried   like starch  most maltodextrins are easily digested and used for energy in the body   so  while the carrots and sweet potatoes are probably fine  they did not contain ingredients that i wanted to feed my baby   the biggest issue being that this information was not included in the product description on amazon  baby and mama approved ,1,0

4347,i wanted to try a batch of cherry wine but couldn t stand the thought of pitting 100000 cherries  this seemed almost ideal  had to guess the dry to fresh weight ratio since information is not readily available  1lb dry equals 3lbs fresh seemed like reasonable estimate so a box of cherries should yield 4 gallons of wine  good recipes are on the web so look it up  batch is 6 weeks old and seems promising  dry   slightly tart  maybe ready to share with friends by christmas time  i bought this to make cherry wine,1,0
4345,i want to avoid sugar intake as much as possible   i have friends who come by who are diabetic and i don t need the calories   i got this and really love the taste it s not got the sort of salty or bitter after taste type of flavor some of them do   it s also not as caustic as mountain dew or pepsi max is  at least to my pallet   just a clean flavor  but not as light as flavored water   yummy  remarkably like the original,1,0
4344,we ordered this since we already knew the gloria jean s butter toffee is one of our favorites   the gloria jean s french vanilla and hazelnut are both good   we have not yet tried the mudslide of the same brand  but will update this review when we do   good price  accurate shipping time  nice product   think the price is lower since the expiration date is about 3 months away  01 2013    that s ok with us since these won t be around long enough to find out if they go stale or not   note that stickers on the boxes obscured the product description so we could not verify the products before the plastic wrapping was removed and we had to acutally open the boxes since these stickers do not peel off   thankfully the products are exactly what we ordered  good k cup variety pack   gloria jean s 96 each,1,0

4598,i like this dog food because they claim to have no added artificial preservatives and the  1 ingredient is beef  so it appears that the dog food would be better for your dog then a lot of the ones you can get in the stores   my dog seemed to enjoy it as well   i am sceptical of all the things they put in dog food  but i have a dog that doesn t tolerate  real  food well  so if you have to give him a dog food  this doesn t seem too bad  seems better for your dog,1,0
4599,i am very pleased by the great improvement in taste of gluten free cookies   even people who can eat wheat like these cookies  unfortunately rice based baked goods require a more protective package when honey or molasses is not prominent in the recipe   cookie tins lined with corrugated cardboard that have crinkled paper cups provide some protection from shock  and should be used instead of thin plastic wrap   makers need to be aware that many gluten sensitive people don t have local stores that carry special foods  and pack for shipping by mail   click on my reviews to see more on this packing issue with gluten free shortbread cookies by pamela  excellent taste poor package,1,0
4600,my darling dog can only eat duck snacks  she is allergic to everything else  i had ordered plato duck strips before and they are excellent   seriously  is there anything a dog won t eat   but these are chunks  thus the four stars instead of five  they are about 2 inches long and an inch wide  preformed snacks  the plato strips i bought before were duck strips  not preformed  of course she loved these but they are covered in a bit of  duck dust  for lack of a better term  so i didn t like to handle them as well as strips  shipping was quick  the packaging says that these are made in america  important to me  if i am going to pay premium prices for dog snacks  i don t want to kill her with chinese products  if you asked her  she would give them five stars  because they smell  duckier   these are duck chunks not strips,1,0
4876,while i agree with others that making you own is much more cost effective  sometimes i need a quick  raw snack that i don t have to make myself   i just found these at my local store for half the price on amazon  they should be ashamed of themselves charging over  11 for these   they are seriously yummy though in my opinion  don t buy here  way overpriced  ,1,0

4874,in anticipation of receiving these peppers i purchased a couple single peppers from a friend and ate them whole to gauge the spiciness  the separate peppers that i purchased were extremely spicy  leaving me in agony for at least 20 minutes each  and making me feel sick for the rest of the day  that was the desired effect   after getting these peppers i gave a few away and ate a couple and found that they were significantly lower in their spiciness  though not disappointingly so  the packaging also gives the idea that they were a few years old and some of them seemed to be fallen apart or shriveled up  overall  they were spicy and came with the amount advertised  decent quality  decent price,1,0
4872,if you haven t bought a 240 count package of tea before  let me tell you how much it is   a lot   that s how much   this is the church s morning tea supply for the next few months the pyramid teabag is very nice   the bag material appears to be a standard tea bag like the kind used by celestial seasonings  but the four corners of the bag were formed into a pyramid instead of a square   a tea bag  of course  will retain some air as it is steeped   a square tea bag will float flat on the surface of the water   a pyramid  on the other hand  floats as an upside down pyramid   i don t know why the air doesn t collect in one of the corners  but it doesn t   bottom line  the rest of the bag  and thus the tea  is submerged  which makes for a  in my opinion  much better steep than a square bag the tea itself is quite enjoyable  although i am not a connoisseur by any means   i use one bag in the morning to make about a liter of tea  then down it with a big breakfast   this tea is not as in your face earthy as the last black tea i tried  a yorkshire blend   and i like it better   it still has that earth and slightly bitter flavor  but it is a little sweeter than the yorkshire blend i tried  probably because it is made from the tips of the plant  as the product name states  or perhaps it came from a different and better crop  or some other reason that i do not know   i am not one to add anything to my tea for sweetening or any other alteration  so i prefer this tea there s just a ton of it   two hundred forty tea bags in an absurd quantity  very good  and a lot of it,1,0

4868,i like this dressing  but the cheesiness seems to take away from its  ranchiness   and vice versa    i would buy this product again if the price was right  but i would prefer to either to buy a purely ranch dressing or a purely cheese dressing  the cheese hides the ranch flavor,1,0

4867,this salt has the most oomph of any of the sea salts i have tried so far   when i first tried this salt that mineral oomph threw me off   i was actually thinking about giving this salt away   now i appreciate the aftertaste kick i get from it   as has been suggested in other reviews here on amazon and around the internet  i would recommend this salt on heartier  blander foods  potatoes  cabbage  stews  etc   that need a little kick   they say you won t be able to taste a finishing salt in a baked dish or a liquid based dish  but if one salt can pull either of those feats off it is this salt  a strong aftertaste,1,0
4865,this product is just as expected   i m new to making my own sushi so i have no experience prior to buying this product  i ve made many spicy tuna rolls and the nori has yet to break on me   i m not sure if it s because i have practically mastered the art of sushi  not really  or just gotten lucky and not rolled the sushi too tightly either way this was a great buy  shipping didn t take long at all   had the nori by the end of the week   would buy again tasty ,1,0

4856,while mainly hibiscus leaves and rosehips  as the label indicates  the vanilla adds a bright aroma and the raspberry a hefty mouthfeel  i did not taste a lot of vanilla  the berry factor weighs more perhaps in the color and the thick quality of the brew  it s not a processed black tea but an herbal one in its lack of caffeination  the amount of leaves in the pyramidal bag is less than i expected  but immersion for 6 minutes  4 6 recommended  brought out the stronger flavor i favor i paired this with fruit muffins  a dessert tart or cake would also fit this beverage well  the taste is not overpowering  and maybe subtler than i expected  but it tastes  clean  and with sweetener  i tried splenda s  nectresse  also reviewed   it brings out more liveliness  without that addition  i found the tea lacked the kick i desired  all in all  delicate  but refined  fine pairing with light fruit cakes or muffins,1,0
4866,this is a decent pudding  but it s a little disturbing not having a list of ingredients on the bag somewhere   the pudding s flavor and texture is good  but there is something about this yellow pudding s flavor that seems artificial to me   3 75 stars  a decent  but processed flavor,1,0
4855,pasta with pre made sauce isn t very hard to make   you boil water  drain it  and heat some sauce in the microwave  the idea that somebody needed to prepackage it and make it simpler seemed to be going a bit far to me  but the convenience factor of having a meal in 60 seconds  not needing a refrigerator and being able to heat it up in workplaces made me want to see how much i d be compromising for convenience i shouldn t have fretted  after all  barilla makes tomato and basil sauce and heating it after taking it out of a jar is no different from heating it while it s in its own compartment in a microwavable tray  i used to make my own pasta  whole wheat is harder to work with so i got lazy  and if i can accept dried pasta  then the idea of pasta that s not dried but has the right water content to be microwaved isn t as odd as it seemed it turned out to be just as advertised  you cook it for 60 seconds  a tray of sauce lifts out  and you pour it on the pasta  it tastes just as good as if you bought dried pasta and a jar of sauce  you don t lose out by getting something microwavable the company is also fairly honest about the ingredients and it says right on the front of the package that it s made with 51  whole wheat pasta   that s a lot better than the competition  which likes to say  made with whole grain  even though they refine some of the grain and pretend the two are separate ingredients  all the ingredients seem good and wholesome except for the mysterious  natural flavors  ingredient  it s not necessarily bad for you  but it s not necessarily good for you  i have no way of knowing  this is low in saturated fat  the non saturated variety comes from olive oil  which is good for you  and the only thing that it s a bit high in is sugar  it contains eight grams  but i d guess that it would contain about five grams if there were no added sugar  since it occurs naturally in other ingredients the bottom line is that this is as good as store bought pasta that you boil yourself  if you like barilla s jarred sauce  and you like their dried pasta  then you ll like this just as much and you ll like the convenience  much better than i expected,1,0

4883,i have never heard of this sauce  but something about the description made me decide to try it  it s an action i do not regret  it is a syrupy  spicy sweet sauce that is a delight  my first use was to pour some onto a stir fry i was making  and it worked wonderfully  i think next  i ll mix in some barbecue sauce and make barbecue with it  i don t think i ll be disappointed  delightful sauce,1,0
4906,the julian s bakery 2 carbs bread and the raisin cinnamon bread used to be great   i tried the new paleo breads and they were so awful that i had to spit them out   then i re ordered the 2 carbs and the cinnamon raisin  but they have a new recipe   now they are terrible  but not quite as bad as the paleo   i was able to eat one slice of each  but then threw out both loaves   i hope they go back to the old recipe   i m so disappopinted with the new recipes  because they used to be very good   i remember that carb krunchers used to have good bread  so i ll go back and try them again  better than julian s bakery,1,0

4901,this syrup has been serving me well  i put in a little bit for each mocha i make at home  without it  my mochas felt bland and didn t taste like coffee very much   it s been making my mochas taste a lot better  my only issue is that it has high fructose corn syrup  which unfortunately  many syrups do but i try to use this in moderation  adds a little extra something when making your own mochas ,1,0

4882,i love this product in fact it s become addictive for me  this time  however  i noticed some very hard pieces when chewing the nuts and after examining more closely  do think somehow shells got into the nuts as they were being shelled  it made me more careful  therefore  less enjoyment because the bitterness distorts the otherwise wonderful flavor and i also don t want to crack or chip a tooth  hope this is an isolated instance with this batch  emerald dry roasted walnuts review,1,0
4896,this is the best tasting cracker i ve ever tasted   it may cost less in a filipino or asian store     which is all well and good unless you don t live close to one  i don t    note that the box says 1 pound 14 ounces   but the description on this page says  28z   whatever a  z  is    if they meant  oz   it s incorrect   it s a 30oz  box   in any case  i was able to find it even cheaper online than the price shown on this page   where   amazon  grin    whenever you buy stuff like this  be sure to consider the  bottom line  price  product plus shipping    and check for alternative amazon pages where it s cheaper   on this page  it s  15 78 for a 30oz box with free shipping  if you total order is  25 or more    but on this page sky flakes crackers 1x850gthe same 30oz box costs only  9 00    5 49 shipping     or  14 49 total  over a dollar cheaper than on this page   so  buy from amazon     but not from this page  the best tasking crackers ever ,1,0

4890,i bought this product because my wife and i decided to make sushi at home  this offer included sushi mat  and nori were not expensive if to compare to anothers  as first time customer  i can say  i got that i expected for money i was ready to spend  but my suggestion for first time users  go to nearest asia market  if you don t live in country definetely  and buy all of it twice cheaper with same quality and will not pay for delivery to company  i believe you can grab more customers if will add at least recipies of sushi in your packs and somehow exclude delivery expenses  your product costs at same price like in charleston s local stores with respect to all my expirience was dual but useful,1,0
4889,i could order these gummi bears every month and still run out of them   i know  they are just pure sugar   they are awful for me   blah blah blah   if you don t like gummi bears and aren t thinking about eating them  why read reviews   but if you have already given yourself over to the idea of ordering gummi bears in bulk  this is the way to go   they are fresh  yummy and delivered to my doorstep in two days  at a great price    what more can a gummi bear addict ask for  gummi goodness,1,0

4887,amazon vine sent me a container of a new product  by the makers of splenda  called nectresse  i have been a fan of splenda since several members of my family were diabetic  sugar gives me a headache  splenda didn t  but  i personally found splenda disappointing to bake with  and the half and half mix really was not a save for me meanwhile  i gave up any hope of making several items  until something even better came along  then came nectresse  made from monk fruit  it is said that the monks in vietnam began cultivating the fruit some 800 years ago  it is naturally sweet and low calorie and is now in this wonderful new product  my husband and i tried it this morning in our tea  we don t require tea to be over sweet  but i like to take the biting edge off the brand of green tea that i buy  we both agree that the taste of this is product is full and sweet  i didn t get a headache  i can t wait to make biscotti this year  i will update this review when i am able to share that experience for now  we find nectresse an excellent product and look forward to finding many more ways to use it  nectresse a sweet option,1,0
4886,of four of my cats only two eat canned food regularly and one nibbles canned food when the mood strikes him   my fourth cat never touches any canned food   therfore  the two that eat the canned food regularly liked this   they immediately ate some and although they did not finish all the food  i can tell they liked it enough to eat it regularly   ps it is not too unusual for me to find canned food left behind no matter what the variety   right now they ve had it a couple of nights in a row  the one that periodically nibbles canned food did not touch it what i like about this food is that it does not stink  many canned foods smell up a house the minute they are opened  such as the meow mix  surf  n turf variety pack  2 75 ounce cups  pack of 48   this one s smell is barely detectable to me the label also indicates this food meets the cats nutritional needs the first five ingredients are chicken  turkey  chicken broth  chicken liver  ground flaxseeds  etc  the peas  which are the 8th ingredient in the list  are noticeable but the last 8 ingredients in the mixture  artichokes  cranberries  pumpkin  tomato  blueberries  broccoli  cabbage  kale  parsley  were not visible  perhaps they were blended in  there are also various vitamins and supplements in the mixture as well as the necessary taurine overall  my regular canned food eating cats liked this and i believe the ingredients are healthy enough for them   i would consider purchasing this or another flavor for them if i wanted to introduce some diversity in their diet besides their usual friskies savory shreds cat food variety pack  8 25 pound or other friskies canned food they are use to  almost  whisker lickin good ,1,0
4885,are you joking about the price   you can get this at fairway  wholefoods  and other health stores for under  5 bucks  so what s the deal with this exorbitant price  it s flat out ridiculous   iwouldn t purchase it here  no way  great bread   bad pricing,1,0
4895,i have fed my cats and dogs nothing but purina products for the past 30 years   i have never had any problems with any of my animals all these years and they have all lived to a ripe old age   when other pets were dying from contaminated food i continued with purina friskies and had no scares at all   there were absolutely no recalls on any purina food i learned my lesson when i tried another brand   the cats ate it only once and wouldn t touch it after that   that s when i looked on the lable  it was bought in my local grocery but was made in thailand  i have nothing against thailand  but i dread to think what was in that food  thai cats must be hardy souls to live on that stuff   this situation made me more dedicated to purina i have tried the expensive  healthy  pet foods and my animals don t like them  so  unless you want to take out a second mortgage on your home to afford  healthy  pet foods  you can rely on good old purina products  unhealthy pet food     bah ,1,0

4829,this brand of tapioca pearls is really good  however  i m wondering why it s over  6  there is an asian market down the way from me that sells this exact brand  exact same size for under  3  i read the description and it doesn t appear to be that you would get more than 1 bag  i would hope that at this price  you d at least get 2 bags   anyway  i like this brand better than any that i ve tried  why so expensive ,1,0
4828,i was going to have this delivered  but i saw it at the grocery store cheaper and then i saw a recall for so many peanut butters  i decided i would just get it after the recalls  i am not saying this brand was recalled  only cheaper at the local stores i found it cheaper at the local grocery store,1,0
4827,i can confirm that this is the exact curry paste used in many thai restaurants   i ve worked in one where this was the case i don t particularly enjoy the smell of this product  but the taste is quite good and will produce a nice result  the minor problem is that the actual paste comes packed in a vacuum sealed bag that itself is stuffed in the tub  this doesn t make much sense to me  why not just seal the tub itself  the paste can be easily popped out of the bag  however this is a cost efficient way to produce curry at home  using three tablespoons of paste for each curry  you ll get about eight uses per 14oz tub  try it  the good stuff  minus the packaging,1,0
4826,i have to say  i wasn t disappointed but i wasn t surprised by these either  it says something on the package about  no more fighting for the corner brownie  on mine  these are not like the corner piece  more like a very thin layer of brownie batter that s crispy and broken up in large and small pieces i dipped mine in peanut butter and it was better  i suggest eating these with milk i got mine at tj max so i got them discounted  it s a different snack for people tired of the same old thing i give it 3 5   4 stars  3 5 stars,1,0
4825,i just purchased this on 08 07 12 for   37 44  i just can not believe how much this went up in price   i was just going to re order but now i will look else where just insane    price almost doubled,1,0
4824,there wasn t anything  everlasting  about this treat ball   my dog had the treat polished off in less than 30 minutes   the ball itself is pretty tough  so i now put treats inside the slots were the everlasting treat was   it works out much better and is far cheaper than replacing the treat itself  tough ball  but remove the treat ,1,0
4823,same price as if i were to go to the store  saved me time   money  and there s no package damage or anything  just the genral friskies box of cat food poultry like i ordered  c   which i m glad i got what i ordered  being as my cat is allergic to seafood   just like from the store ,1,0
4830,i bought this product twice   the first time i received it as advertized and it was good   drinking one cup a day i have enough for next year 2013      i received another bag at the beginning of sept which i could not return because it is grocery   not sure how i got it   but definitely got the bill   i am now good through 2015 at current consumption so i  will have aged tea   hopefully it is like fine wine     i checked to see if i joined a club or some thing   but could not find the answer     if i receive another bag in october will have a  tea party  in november     didn t order,1,0
4822,i bought this for my young son who wanted to try peanut brittle   i looked at my local stores for peanut brittle  but could not find any   then i looked online for peanut brittle   after looking at all the avaiable peanut brittle products  i found that most peanut brittle had poor reviews  due to lack of peanuts anyway  these bars are solid peanuts with just enough candy to keep it together   i highly reccomend this product for flavor and value   i did recieve about five bars that were broken in the 24 count case  but i break them anyway before i eat one anyway  so not a real big deal   another nice factor is that becouse there are so many peanuts and very little candy the bars are not break your teeth hard  they are just right  good quality product,1,0
4819,i saw these items advertised and thought they looked like they might be good and would like to try them  i looked at the amazon item and found them   12 for 24 75 and thought wow   if i bought them and did not like  i was out a bunch of cash i went to the local mart and found them for a buck fifty  bought one each of three flavors i found them to be quite good  liked them and they are quick and easy i will buy them again but not from amazon i am a prime member and after a year i found that  for the most part prime is a scam that needs to be looked into by the gov the inflated prices on items more than pays for the cost of shipping and handling the prime membership fee then is pure profit i will probably  buy from amazon  one time items but not items bought on a regulsr basics any one who has an over abundance of cash  please post here and i wll contasct you asi could sure ise it  thank you louis patyk amazon prime,1,0
4818,i tried to buy this product because my dog loves lean treats from the veterinary practicethat i use when she was very sick and ate very little  she would eat lean treats i tried to buy them through the amazon website  from another seller but the delivery company  dhl could not deliver them they apparently  don t know how to use a gps and a 911 address in thecountry toots did not receive product,1,0

4814,it helped a ton with my anxiety  but it didn t make me sleepy at all  the taste was minty  but it didn t taste very flavorful overall i have very bad insomnia issues though  so my experience is probably not typical  not as powerful as i had hoped,1,0

4821,so the aroma in dry form was a bit meh     it smelled like suntan lotion however once prepared it is very good so just either get past the aroma or don t sniff it not that it easy to ignore any matcha smell as the powder sort of makes its way into the nose no matter what ya do my daughter and i got distracted singing  put the lime in the coconut      haha now you are all going to be singing that in your heads     the point however is in messing around i dumped the powder into my cup instead of my mixing bowl  yikes i thought i had made a huge mistake but i just went ahead and added straight milk to it   no water   can you believe it   this stuff is good  coconut milk hahah  i am sure you can pull this off with any milk product or almond  soy etc   hey maybe even coconut milk oh and you know how i said sangria frothed up well   well     this frothed up super easy  huge foam  i may have to try doing more of my matcha this way   just skipping the water all together  now this is what i call a happy accident so so so yummy  coconutty,1,0
4853,i would recommend this salt more for aesthetics than for taste   though this salt isn t my favorite sea salt flavor wise  every once in a while i appreciate its  high pitched ping  aftertaste   the hunky  flaky crystals can be as large as a single die and can be crushed in between the fingers  if one has strong fingers   taste   3 75 stars   aesthetics  4 5 stars  large  dense  flaky crystals,1,0

4833,our kitty seems to be partial to the friskies pink can  salmon and beef   this brand  though more expensive  did not seem to generate the enthusiasm that she has for the friskies  she actually walked away and left this sitting  maybe this would have generated more active gulping in the cold winter months  she s an outdoor cat  or maybe her tastes are just more pedestrian the catfood has a pleasant color  looks fresh and smells ok  it does generate a little of its own juice surprising that she wasn t more interested in this well touted chicken catfood  who knows maybe she just prefers fish   who knows what lurks in the minds of kitties         cat ate this with less enthusiasm than other less expensive brands ,1,0
4850,you know what s sad  at the time of purchasing this  i was a starbucks employee  and this was less expensive than the same product on the actual starbucks site     with my partner discount included i am true to my half jewish roots  aka i am super cheap   and this made me happy  i saved a few bucks and i still got my coffee    i need an iv drip of sumatra,1,0
4849,the deer in my area  private land in the south western part of virginia  really like this product  i poured it out once in front of a trail camera and the deer activity remained fairly constant at the location for 2 weeks  they scraped the first 2 3 inches of soil off trying to get to it  i poured it out again when the acorns started falling and there was probably 50  less activity at the site but  they were still visiting the site  because these are not farm country deer and reside mostly deep in the mountains  i will continue to use the product to provide the deer with minerals they would otherwise have a difficult time locating naturally and because they apparantly like the taste smell because they usually find it the same day i put it out  not to mention  it s much easier to carry up the mountain than a 50lb sack of corn  works,1,0
4848,i ve tried several brands of instant over the last couple of years  i m not a heavy coffee drinker anymore so i don t bother to brew it  but i ve enjoyed coffee in the past and was a fan of melitta  peet s  and otherwise good brands of coffee  when it comes to instant most are drech  they re nearly undrinkable   i even bought expensive star bucks instant and it was the worst i ve had  horribly bitter with a pronounced chemical taste  that seems to be how most instants are  i m not sure how jacob s does it but this instant tastes like fresh brewed coffee  it has a very neutral taste  but very good and clean and inoffensive at the same time  i enjoyed this coffee so much i ve convinced other friends to try it and they ve enjoyed it as well  best instant i ve had and even better than a lot of fresh roasts as well  best instant you can buy ,1,0

4846,i use a variety of gluten free flours  i had read about how great this flour is for baking  especially for it s light texture and no carbs  however  it seems a bit dense and clumpy to me  i ve never used any other almond flours so i ve nothing to compare it to except almond meal and it does remind me of a less dense almond meal  just not quite what i expected  i ll use it in some more baking recipes before a final decision  not as fluffy as i thought,1,0
4845,got this with my sodastream genesis    i thought it was pretty cool that it came with some of the flavors in sample size  ive used about 1 2 or so because i dont really like diet drinks my only thought is that it might be a good idea to have a mix   match option if you like some types or flavors but not others   maybe sell them as singles as well  overall definitely a neat idea though i wouldnt buy this particular set of 12 again if your new to sodastream   or some of their flavors i would recommend this so you can get a general idea what some of the flavors are about  great idea to have trial sizes,1,0
4844,raccoons were devouring about a gallon of seed from my large bird feeder every night  at  60 per 50 lb bag of seed that gets pricey    the squirrels i had baffled but the raccoons were driving me mad  and who likes to be outsmarted by a raccoon   so i bought this fence charger  wrapped a coil of bare wire around 1 25  pvc pipe and slid the pipe over the mounting pole for the feeder   this is done in such a way that an animal climbing the pole will have its front paws on coil and back paws on metal pole or ground   i also mounted it high enough so that snow won t short it out  the hot lead goes to the coil  ground goes to ground   no more raccoon problem  works a treat,1,0
4832,i m a huge mcdougall cuppa soup fan  i ve tried them all and the split pea is my favorite  it s creamy with bits of barley and reconstituted dehydrated veggies  i always feel good about reaching for a cuppa instead of some unhealthy snack with lots of useless calories i agree with other reviewers regarding the portion size  there s no way to eat half the contents of the cup and save the rest for later or share with someone  the labelling should be changed to reflect that the container holds one serving  not two  and all the nutrition facts should be changed accordingly  easy  quick  healthful snack,1,0
4843,i purchased this drink supplement some time back  and after trying it  quit  because of the gritty tasteless feel it had in my mouth   finally tried it again since i didn t want to throw it away  this time with apple juice  which i only purchased by chance to make bbq    that was everything  tasted okay  not bad at all   i now take it more regularly  the container says to try it with juice  but i never did on the container  it uses the term  delicious    i would say thats misleading  but with apple juice or whatever works for you  its not bad at all i don t notice any effects  which i think is hard for most people anyway   i drink it because i think itshealthy and i want to optimize my heath  has good ingredients hard to tell effects,1,0
4841,i dont drink starbucks coffee through the retail stores  so i cant compare it to that   however  i have tried over 35 different k cup flavors   this ranks in the middle to high on the favorites list   it s simple  bold  and good staple in your k cup arsenal   i did have one out of 54 bust in the machine   i wouldn t pay retail for this  however is was on warehouse deals for  22 and was well worth it  great kcup,1,0
4840,this was the 1st flavor i tried   i purchased at my local store for way less money than amazon is offering it for today    5 29 a pint locally   however  amazon does have a better selection of flavors available i have not eaten ice cream in years  the high fat upsets my stomach   this a tasty treat for the person who does not have to have heavy fat and sugar content   the only things that would make this product better is if it cost less and it was totally free of processed sugar because of the cost this will only be a once in a while treat   i do think i could eat a pint each day    pretty good,1,0
4839,to me velveeta tastes like those tin foiled christmas cheeses found in those sausage gift packages   so if you like those christmas cheeses you will probably like velveeta   i like this cheese  but its processed flavor gets to me after a while   from what i understand velveeta is not vegetarian  for those who are concerned about such things   3 75 stars  nice texture  processed flavor,1,0

4836,the above title pretty much says almost all i need to say about this product   it has a dense texture and a wheat taste   by itself the flavor is good but not  yummy    i would add some oil to the crust  both to the top and the bottom  to give it a little more flavor   i don t think this product would enhance an otherwise homemade pizza  but i don t think it would detract from it either  dense texture  wheat taste,1,0

4973,nectresse was given to me free for review i am not a splenda fan  particularly  i don t like the taste as much as i like stevia  since nectresse is from the makers of splenda  i was not sure what to expect  but i ended up quite liking this product  i did not feel like it had a noticeable aftertaste  as some have stated  but i did notice that it is very sweet  so a little goes a long way  this is good news  since i think the price is rather high  it makes the difference in whether or not i would actually buy the product  and i probably would  i did try nectresse in both herbal tea and in coffee  and i liked it in both beverages  i did not try it in a cold beverage  but noticed that it dissolved easily  and it should be fine in cold beverages  as well  when you first use the product  adjust down by at least half and see if this is the right amount of sweetness for you  i found that i was using about half of what i originally use with other sweeteners  also  because a less can be used  the gastrointestinal problems that some have mentioned might not be a problem  i ve used it a few times and have not been bothered  i quite like this product ,1,0

4971,this bag is so addictive that i just about went into withdrawal when i couldn t find it once at my local warehouse store   i love chewy dried fruit  and this stuff really hits the spot   i don t agree with the review who said that the flavor of the mango and banana is  off   because she s probably just used to tasting the chemicals other companies use to preserve the color of their fruit   the ingredients on this bag read   organic bananas  organic mangoes  organic pineapples    that s it what she and i can agree on is that the current amazon price of roughly  15 is ludicrous   i just picked up two 16 oz bags at my warehouse store for  0 99 each    i think this was a mistake  because they were labeled on the shelf as  3 99    definitely shop around  and try not to eat the whole bag in one sitting not that i would know anything about that    ahem    so tasty for me   as my 3 year old would say,1,0

4969,i have previously tried the whole grain style of pasta from a box and thought it was very nasty  but thought that i would give this one a try as i had hoped it had improved over time  not same brand  and was a healty choice after slightly opening the plastic cover wrap  to allow venting  you place it in the microwave to cook for 60 seconds   after removing it  the plastic cover wrap seems to be stuck a bit firmly to the container  so removal of it should be done carefully or you will spill your sauce   there is a separate removable mini sauce tray inside of the larger pasta tray that allows you to pour the sauce on your pasta the sauce tastes just like the normal barilla sauce  not my normal brand  and the pasta was cooked just about right if i had not known that this was whole grain pasta  then i might not have noticed the slight whole grain flavor of the pasta   it really is not that noticeable and was not bad for what it was if the price was right  i might have this again in the future   would be good for less than 2 bucks  but under three would work too it is more likely to be used for a work or school lunch  as the portion size was not a  meal  for someone like myself  not bad,1,0
4966,no problems at all  product was as advertised  jar was full  and it was delivered quickly  the oil was very clean looking and did not appear to be modified  it is nothing but coconut oil  as advertised,1,0

4961,my dog goes absolutely crazy for these  and the majority of bones and treats he doesn t eat   we were driving to one of those awful places that describes itself as a  boutique  dog store and paying  5 per bone  but ordering these online cuts down on both the cost and the pretentiousness caution   these things smell like fish   they don t just smell like fish  they will make about 400 square feet of your house smell like fish   they are individually wrapped  and even through the shipping envelope a nasty fish odor permeated again  my dog loves them   i had wrapped the envelope in two plastic bags and he was still going insane at the smell   if you have a locking storage container with a rubber seal  that works pretty well  though i recommend a vacuum sealer  dog loves them  but smelly,1,0

4959,at first  using pb2 was confusing as the ratio of powder to water in the directions gave me a very dry crumbly mess  as i experimented  i found adding more water  a little at a time  gave me the consistency of peanut butter that i desired  i like that the fat is almost all removed and when prepared  can be used just like regular peanut butter with much less calories  a treat for me as i love peanut butter but can enjoy it more so using pb2 i did remove one star as i m not happy that sugar is added to this product  wish it was an artificial sweetener or nothing at all   tastes like real peanut butter,1,0
4967,this is the only sweet and sour sauce out of the five i tried from my grocer that has nice tangy vinegar taste and smell  la choy also mixes a sweet taste in as well  while not up to the level of restaurant s w it s still good  the other store sauces were flat and dull  one tasted more like bitter pineapple juice  sweet   vinegary ,1,0
4958,we live in an area that does not have a lot of stores that carry organic at reasonable prices  that said i found the product to be a good value and convenient not to have to sometimes wait for local stores to restock  if they even stocked yes  some cans get dented in transit but it really was not a big problem for me  i hope the future delivery is the same or better it is unknown if the can lining is bpa free  i try to avoid it but until the manufactures get it out it s near impossible to buy canned goods that don t have bpa in the can lining  pregnant women should avoid anything with bpa in it and if i had growing children i would also strive to avoid  good  value for me,1,0
4979,i shipped a case of this stuff to the girlfriend when she was sick and stuck at home  she thought it was really good  she wasn t able to taste much of anything else but she said she was able to taste this and thought it was really good   i don t know if it means that this was really salty or what     instant chicken noodle soup,1,0
4982,i am not the type of person who wants her coffee to bite her back as she sips   i want to simply enjoy the flavor   i found this cup of coffee to be very nice   i would have liked a touch more robustness  as it lacking a bit in flavor  which is why i am giving it 4 stars    it isn t bitter   it isn t harsh   it doesn t taste burnt  i don t have to wince while i drink it  and to me  that is something   i appreciate a lighter roast   it s a nice cup of coffee  a perfectly pleasant cup of coffee,1,0

4999,i have tried a few light honeys and i will definitely be buying this one again  i ll be getting the five pounder   i know some reviewers have been complaining about the texture  my suggestion is to let the honey sit in a cool area for two days to let the capping rise to the top and completely solidify  when i received mine  the product had been shipped on its side and it was in a liquid state from the heat  the capping was floating at the wrong angle  this caused the capping to mix into the rest of the honey when i turned it upright  to fix this  simply let it sit somewhere cool so the crystallization process solidifies the honey and allows you to scrape the cap away and get to the honey beneath it    it should no longer contain all the gritty parts of the capping i love honey comb  however  so i enjoy eating this honey directly from the jar  i just received it yesterday and i ve finished half of the jar  it s that good this is the only light honey i ve been able to eat from the jar  others have been too sweet  this one is nearly perfect to my tastes another reviewer said that ys honey is better than this one because ys has an organic label  it is insanely hard for bee keepers in america to offer organic honey  and this company practices organic methods and does not use chemicals on their farms  i trust them  and i seriously doubt that the bees are venturing too far from home if they already have an abundant supply of flowers to choose from  this is as organic as honey can get in america ys honey tastes horrible compared to this honey  it s almost sickeningly sweet and impossible for me to eat from the jar  this one speaks for itself  i m going to have to buy a bigger jar for it to last through a months worth of tea drinking while i prefer dark honey like honeydew and neem  this one is packed on site and never enters a barrel  this is becoming a problem for me and dark honey  i want honey that hasn t touched a barrel  and i haven t found a dark honey that offers this try this honey if you want something truly raw  if you don t like honey comb then you shouldn t try this  you will get a mouthful of honey comb from the capping  and it is nutritious but chewy the lids and jars are bpa free  there is a seal between the jar and lid  this is rare  lots of honeys tend to lack a seal and touch the lid through transit  if the lid is made of metal  chances are it has a food liner made of plastisol  which contains pvc   or it has a food liner that is hiding bpa in it  when you find organic honeys that have metal lids and the honey has touched the lid through transit  then it isn t as  organic  as it used to be i definitely recommend this honey to anyone looking for a light and truly raw honey  one of the best  light  honeys,1,0
4998,despite the bad description on amazon about this kit i still rate this at 4 stars  anybody who is big into making kits should know that all port kits are sold in 3 gallon kits  for the price of this kit i had no idea how well it would turn out so i bought one of these kits almost 2 years ago and i loved it so much that last december i bought 2 more  i have entered this kit into an international amateur wine competition last april and won a silver in the port category  this wine is so much better if you wait at lest a year before drinking  the longer you age it the smoother it gets  i am going to buy one or two more kits this december just so i can stay stocked up  my top wine kit,1,0
4997,the purchase was worth while  you have to keep in mind what it is  and what it is not  it s not a substitute for a nice cold glass of ice water  but i purchased it for my mother in law who do to medical reasons was on a fluid restricted diet  what it does do is help eleviate the unpleasantness that serious thirst can cause  works well  and doesn t taste bad at all  it works ,1,0

4994,so i got this and tasted it strait out of the bottle  it tasted like smoky flavored milk   yuck  i was depressed i was stuck with 4 bottles of this   it sat on my shelf and i forgot about it  last weekend i tasted a zevia cream soda and was not pleased with the flavor  it tasted weird and smokey like the lorann oil i had gotten   i tried to doctor up the soda with a little sf vanilla torani syrup and a tablespoon of heavy cream   it tasted amazing     the odd smokiness was gone and it had a wonderful rich mouthfeel so i wanted to see if this would help the lorann oil too   i put a cup of whipping cream in a bowl and added a teaspoon of vanilla and tasted it  it tasted fine   then i added one drop of the oil  it is very strong  and stirred it in   it tasted so much better   i whipped it up and put it on fruit and it was such a treat now i will always whip a drop of it with vanilla into desserts and whip cream   it was such a happy accident to find out how to use it   when added to vanilla it really adds a new depth of flavor and tastes so different than just out of the bottle or on its own in cream it is very potent so only use a drop and increase after tasting  if you add too much it will ruin the recipe so use a light touch  do not taste from bottle  mix with vanilla for true flavor ,1,0
4992,this assortment is very well worth the money   you cannot beat the price and the selection is not just a bunch of short tiny pieces   i have ordered this twice and both times the bag was actually over the five pounds they advertise   if your dog likes these bully sticks you cannot go wrong ordering this    great selection,1,0
4991,good product   have used saccharin for over 20 years and this is the one  i ordered a case of 12 bottles  1 4 grain equals one teaspoon of sugar   however  i only got 10  when i emailed they gave me back the money for the two without even asking if this is what i wanted  i didn t  i wanted 12 bottles  so  now i have to buy 2 more and i can t get just 2 at the price they returned to me  i would have rather returned them and ordered a box of 12 from another seller   so  product is good  would recommend it but buy from a different seller      good product   crummy seller,1,0

4986,i had to smile at a previous review noting that what the reviewer liked best about this product is the packaging  yes  the packaging is brilliant    well thought out  and deftly executed in an appealing orangey peach  or maybe a peachy orange  this is one i ll definitely recycle and re use  after removing the product and the label ah  the label  that s the first problem   no  actually  that s the  second  problem  because if you re a manufacturer and you hear customers raving about the packaging rather than about the product  you know you might have a bigger problem than labeling  as for the label  the information it provides appears to be accurate  yes  a quarter teaspoonful of nectresse certainly provides the sweetness of a teaspoon of sugar  with that sweetness  though  comes a bit of an aftertaste    not terrible  but present  add a second quarter teaspoonful to the first  however  and what you get is   for me  at least    an undrinkable cup of coffee with a conspicuous aftertaste  a bowl of oatmeal so excessively sweet as to be off putting  for me  the degree of aftertaste seems to depend on the food into which the nectresse is blended  a quarter spoonful in a 16 ounce glass of iced tea was not unpleasant  more than that  as in coffee and oatmeal  was too much for me  a quarter teaspoon in a half cup of high end  strongly flavored greek yogurt  however  changed my initial two star rating to three  in some preparations  i could learn to like this product for some users  the more disturbing aspect of the label is the ingredients list  as noted above  the second ingredient  meaning the second largest quantity in the formulation of the product  is sugar  the fourth  molasses  the presence of sugar  or molasses  in any food product is  for those of us who have had gastric bypass or other digestive procedures or issues  is a red flag  try googling  dumping syndrome  if you re not sure what happens when many or most who ve had gastric bypass consume sugar in even small quantities   the amount of sugar in nectresse is said to be very small indeed  but i feel way more comfortable with splenda s list of ingredients  maltodextrin and sucralose  while both splenda and nectresse are derived from sugar  i am inclined to stick with the former  which i know my body can tolerate without unhappy consequences 10 20 12   after trying this product in various foods over the past couple of weeks  i ve come to like it better and added a star  my earlier impressions still stand  however  used sparingly  and i do mean sparingly  and selectively  choosing those foods in which it works for me and those in which it doesn t  i ve come to believe this is a worthwhile product with some promise in the marketplace  a neighbor who tried it along with me liked it a great deal  but we    both long time  regular users of splenda    wondered why nectresse would ever replace splenda  with its handy teaspoon for teaspoon equivalency to sugar  on our shelves  on the table  maybe  but in the pantry  i m still not sure both splenda and nectresse come from the same manufacturer  mcneil nutritionals   1 4 tsp is ok  maybe    but double that  and it s way too much,1,0
4984,my little one loves gerber good start gentle  i was unable to breast feed when he was born so we had to go with formula  we started with similac on the advice of the hospital  within a week we knew something was up  he would scream and scream all day  we switched to similac sensitive  that s what his lactose intolerant cousin was on  thinking lactose intolerance and it only got worse  by 4 weeks old we were told he had colic  i said bs my husband did some research and found gerber gentle  we switched our little one cold turkey at 1 month old and the next day we received his first smiles  it turns out our son has a casein intolerance  confirmed by his pediatrician  and gerber gentle is the only one with whey protein only  that isn t soy  most formulas have whey and casein to make up their milk proteins  which is normal   and the added benefit  no corn syrup  we started with ready to feed formula until he was 4 months old due to his sensitive tummy  we now use powder and i love it as gerber doesn t clump too much and it doesn t create a lot of extra bubbles when mixing it up like the similac did to each their own  but we love gerber  this formula saved us ,1,0

4929,ortho sells a number of weed b gon products  and it took me some searching to find exactly the one i wanted  i wanted one of the versions containing the chemical triclopyr  which is what my state agricultural university extension service recommends for killing wild violets  which for several years had been stubbornly resisting all my organic methods to keep them from taking over my lawn  since i only had a fairly small area to spray and didn t want to invest in major league spraying equipment if i didn t have to  this version was just what i needed  it s very easy to use  you just attach it to the end of your garden hose  turn on the water  not full blast  just enough to make a nice controllable spray  and spray it on your broadleaf weeds  they absorb the triclopyr through their leaves  it messes them up bad and they die there was enough in the bottle for me to spray the wild violets that hadn t died after the first application  as the directions and my extension service mentioned  you usually can t get them all the first try   actually  i spent twice as much money on the respirator i bought to wear when i was doing my spraying  i strongly recommend you read the directions carefully and follow the safety instructions  you don t want to inhale this stuff or get it in your eyeballs or mouth or on your skin  triclopyr is supposed to break down fairly quickly and not leave residual traces  we ll see about that  works on wild violets,1,0

4933,i m known to be a salty person  so that may be why i like this so much  this is so much better than chewy jerky  i d much rather have dry leathery jerky than chewy  greasy jerky  to me  jerky should be salty to help keep your sodium during a long trip or physical activity  i don t write reviews on amazon much  but felt i should chime in on this product  funny  but my local sunoco station in pgh carries this brand and it s the only one i buy  except if i visit my home state of texas and go to buccee s gas station where they have a full and i do mean full jerky deli style counter with all kinds of fresh jerky by the lb  it is a jerky lover s dream  i like salty,1,0
4934,the gelatin is flavorless   it softens in a little room temperature water in only a few minutes   i put it into my coffee or yogurt twice daily   good value  it s gelatin ,1,0
4935,i received this product in good time   i enjoyed most of the coffee   just not crazy about items that were not coffee    but   that is me  i doubt i would purchase again  i would just purchase  coffee    that has more to do with what i spend my money on then the service i received  sampler pack,1,0
4953,i just called bob s red mill and talked to a representative there   i was told that the packaging has been changed and no longer states  aluminum free  but  natural    it would be helpful if amazon clearly stated that the packaging has been changed by bob s red mill so that one will not be ordering bob s red mill aluminum free baking soda when this is no longer an item   it would save wasted time by customers who are trying to rectify  what was sent when it appears that a name change took place   it would also spare vendors from receiving less than excellent reviews  aluminum free versus natural bob s red mill baking soda,1,0
4952,this is a very mild pistachio oil  i tasted some in a restaurant recently and thought i would try a purchased brand before making my own  it doesn t seem to have any bits of pistachio in it which was what i expected  but it goes well in a salad and i guess i could add my own bits of pistachio to it  pistachio oil,1,0
4950,don t buy this from this site    i assumed i was getting a carton   it is completely overpriced   walmart sells them for 6 7  for a 4pk  rip off,1,0
4949,this is pretty good   it is quite sweet  but it doesn t have that horrible diet y aftertaste if you put it in something   it s not as good on its own  very sweet   and it does have a bit of that aftertaste   i put a teaspoon in my coffee  and it was way too sweet  but no bad taste after   i had another cup with just a slight sprinkle  and it s good   the serving size is 1 4 tsp  so don t go overboard there are two openings on the top   there is a tiny opening for pouring directly into your drink  and a very large opening if you want to scoop some out with a spoon   that was a very good idea the very first ingredient is erythritol  which i like a lot   i usually use that in my coffee   it s not as sweet as sugar  but has no bad taste   the second ingredient is sugar   i m not sure why that is needed   the third ingredient is monk fruit  which i suspect is what makes this so sweet   the last ingredient is molasses  which probably gives it a little flavor other than just sweet there are no calories in 1 4 tsp  but with the sugar and molasses  i suspect that s just a matter of rounding down   but that s still less than full sugar   i like this   it s too expensive for baking cookies with  but it s good for your coffee  sweet   slight aftertaste,1,0
4948,these capsules work well and i am very satisfied with how they compare to the nespresso coffee capsules couple things to remember to avoid disappointment 1  use good quality coffee  i use illy  lavazza or starbucks2  make sure you grind the coffee beans at the grocery store to espresso fine3  fill the capsule to the top with your ground coffee  do not under fill or you will get watery coffee 4  pack the coffee in the capsule by tapping the spoon down  but don t pack it down too much or you will not get good flow these capsules  when used as above make a delicious crema  froth    just as enjoyable as the nespresso but for a total cost including capsules  shipping and coffee of under 30 cents each compared to nespresso at 60 to 68 cents each enjoy  on my 5th box of ne cap capsules,1,0
4947,to be honest  i never heard of tazo teas i mean  i have never had a cup of coffeein my life    i drink lots and lots of tea i drink twining  bigelow  ahmad  yogi  and even lipton teas cut to the chase  i bought two small boxes of  tazo assorted tea sampler  24 tea bags   and am pleasantly surprised the box  clearly  says  8oz  of hot water one bag  steep 5 minutes                                                   i m thinking i can get more tea from o t h e rcompanies  tea bags  but   here is where the taste is i m an american irishman  in europe  these bagsare worth you looking into  too try it                                                   i guess i don t get out much   ,1,0

4944,this mix just arrived today  so i can t comment yet on the quality of the product   however  when i ordered it  i had no idea how it was going to arrive   the picture in the listing shows a mound of loose powder   i thought perhaps i d get an unlabeled plastic bag with 5 pounds of mystery scone powder in it   instead  the krusteaz mix is packed in paper similar to the way they package 5 pound bags of flour or sugar   it s fully labelled as a krusteaz product  then amazon put the paper bag into a plastic  bag for shipping   just thought i d share this in case anyone else is wondering  the picture threw me off ,1,0

4942,i am trying to avoid too much sugar  but aspartame makes me feel gross and well  it is gross   this is sweetened with stevia  a plant  and xylitol  from fruit fiber    i bought the berry tea flavor and i think it tastes good   i think it is too strong sweet mixed full strength  which is great for me  because one packet lasts longer     i put 1 2 1 3 packet in a 16 9 oz bottle of water when i know i need to drink water but would rather have a soda  lol   i don t taste an aftertaste at all but it s too sweet mixed full strength   great option  perfect for giving water flavor without the aspartame ,1,0
4941,this food seriously is seriously gross looking  merrick s regular line of wet food products have kind of a chunky look to them  where you can see the peas and carrots and whatnot  well  before grain must live up to its 96  meat claim  because all you get when you open it up is pureed pink nastiness    which your dogs are going to go bananas over  the pureed consistency makes it super easy to mix in with their dry food  i keep some cans on hand for the days when my dogs are being finicky with their food    or i just feel like giving them an extra treat the ingredient list speaks for itself  like all merrick products  i highly recommend this for your precious pup  looks like vomit  the dogs love it ,1,0
4940,this is decent shu  but the amount you get for the price is meager  i ve been using 3 sections in my small yixing pot  i guess if it was about half the price i would recommend it  pu heads stay away,1,0
4939,i love celsius  granted  i ve failed to continue any workout regiment for over 2 years now and i ve barely put on weight  i don t have a fast metabolism  at all  but for me  celsius is kinda like my safety net  i worry about what i put in my body  about the lack of exercise i do  and this takes away the guilt feeling for a little while but  i haven t been receiving what i ve paid for  i ve recently been receiving 2 sparkling cola  3 raspberry acai green tea  3 sparkling orange  2 orange  2 sparkling wild berry  where is my favorite peach mango green tea  or strawberry kiwi  iced lemon tea  apple orchard blend  i ve recently been getting 2 iced lemon tea but i didn t get any this time  i prefer the non carbonated ones more but i m not even getting those it should list what you re getting instead of false information  the product itself is fantastic  but i m not getting what i paid for  i love celsius but   ,1,0
4938,i have been drinking this tea every night just for the benefits it claims to produce  however it is a little bland tasting  i usually don t add sugar and just drink it quickly but i was a little disappointed that it isn t more flavorful considering all of the natural herbs it contains  this is just one of those things where you won t really know if it worked or not  but the price was good and i ll continue drinking it every night  by the way i thought the price was for one box  but you get three boxes which will cover you for the entire third trimester  it also says to drink several times a day  but i ve only been drinking it once every night  a good tea but   ,1,0
4937,mmmm  lavender  such an awesome scent  i thought it would be great in soda form but i was sadly disappointed  no traces of lavender in my soda  no soapy taste  no nothing  it tasted like sprite but is less fizzy  less sweet  love the taste  but i wish it had the scent  especially for the high novelty price tag  on the bright side  it may definitely be my sprite replacement at 70 calories for a 12 fl oz bottle  i also cannot wait to try it with gin     good soda but doesn t have lavender anything,1,0
4936,five stars for taste  packaging  serving size  however   walmart has them individually for only 88 cents per one ounce package  so you would only be paying  15 84 for 18 packages  that s a deal  you d be saving  3 17  plus  you can mix and match different favors and you don t have to buy a whole lot of one flavor     my advice   don t buy online,1,0

4810,i am now giving a 5 five star review to health garden  please ignore my 1st review as it was my error in  reading  wrongly health garden s website  mea culpa  i hope that health garden accepts my heartfelt apology for the initial  bad review  i went on a  rant  because of the message i received from the health garden website concerning an order i placed with health garden for their  kosher birch xylitol  at which time i noticed a  currently unavailable we don t know when or if this item will be back in stock  message   please see all that ranting below  i guess i did not check my email closely enough to  see  that my order of 30 lbs  of health garden kosher birch xylitol had already sent me a  shipping  order that my order was placed and would arrive on oct 2nd or 3rd which it did  i did not  notice  until after  i posted this  rant   my bad  because that shipment arrived the day after i wrote the following  bad review  again  please see my initial  rant   again although i have yet to try health garden kosher birch xylitol but am excited to get started because after researching a gazillion xylitol products  health garden kosher birch xylitol got the best reviews on every  review  site i researched  so i am sure it will be a great product  first review was not correct,1,0
4807, 10 bucks for 4 ounces is ridiculous  but if you need it  and cant get it locally  what choice do you have needed it for smoking and curing salmon filets so it worked   but i m going to have to find a different recipe for smoking and curing  i just cant afford these prices in the future if it was 80z or 120z  i could swallow that           but even filet mignon isn t this expensive  ridiculously expensive        but what can you do ,1,0
4682,tried wolfgang and baronet coffees after senseo brand coffee became hard to find    wolfgang coffee ok  but like the baronet coffee better  will order that one again  baronet coffee     will order again,1,0
4681,looks like a jar of black vaseline but denser  taste like a cross between soy sauce with a mushroomy blend  i spread it  almost clear thin on my cracker   that  s all i can take  i ate on it all day when it first came in the mail   but barely making a dent in the jar  my hands were swollen the next day from the sodium  wow ,1,0
4679,was not disappointed in this product  taste good and not too salty and provide a good crunch  i would recommend to others  good product,1,0
4678,at first sip  i thought the lipton herbal blackberry vanilla tea tasted too much like cherry cough medicine  with the blackberry vanilla flavor just a bit too strident and artificial tasting  kind of like overloaded hazelnut coffee  on second taste  i fell in love with this  feeling like it had a sustaining and alluring flavor  i can t explain why it feels sustaining  as it is caffeine free  perhaps the richness of flavor is at work i triangulated with my housemates on this housemate the 1st   it has an interesting back note  housemate the 2nd  an oratorical type    it revives a feeling of nostalgia  it s not very tinged  not a wake up coffee  it s a very mild tea  this is very  very good  this kind of tea leaves a taste on your taste buds  and doesn t stick to your teeth  i m going to heat another cup  so    this is certainly worth a try if you like fun brassy flavors in tea  it contains real hibiscus flowers  rose hips  sweet blackberry leaves  dried black currant pieces  dried blackberry pieces  dried blueberry pieces and sunflower lecithin  it comes in an infusion pyramid rather than a paper bag  somewhat more tricky to compost but not a big deal  takes time to appreciate  then wow ,1,0
4677,i received the kind dark chocolate nuts and sea salt bar as a free sample  since it was free  i enjoyed it  but would not pay the high price to buy it the flavor was good  but nothing special  the nuts didn t have a prominent flavor because they were overpowered by the salt and chocolate  it also seemed small for 200 calories and didn t fill me up  good  not great,1,0
4676,this is a really good tea with a sweet clean green tea flavor and no weird tangy after taste like some other bottled teas  i regularly purchase the gallon size at the store but since i purchased this 12 pk from amazon in june 2012 the price has more than doubled  i don t really know what s behind that but i always figured that purchasing in bulk should be cheaper than purchasing individually but at this price   24 at the time of this review it isn t  i m giving this 4 stars for the fact that its a good product with one off for the price  i would purchase this again from amazon if the price came back down to something reasonable  good tea bad price,1,0
4675,this is nice different tea  it is not too sweet but flavorful  although it says blackberry vanilla  neither flavor is overwhelming  it brews readily and you can actually get probably a cup and a half from one teabag  i really like the new tea bags that seem to get the flavor out quicker than the old style teabags  i probably won t buy this tea as i prefer the regular tea as it has a stronger flavor  this tea would be nice for someone looking for a flavorful non caffeinated tea  nice flavor  not too sweet ,1,0
4683,tried all the friendly ways to get rid of gophers   none worked   set two of these traps back to back as the directions say   3 days later  pulled the traps out and one dead gopher   nothing works better   didn t feel like prying the dead gopher out of the trap  so just tossed the whole thing in the trash   best  6 i ever spent  these things work ,1,0
4674,these are tasty and good but there to salty for me  other people may find them not so salty  and good   at least there not greasy or full of grissel   i like the size and the cover of bites is good   i eat whole bag so if you eat one bite maybe not to salty   turkey bites,1,0
4671,it s a proper good salmon caviar  not that lumpfish fake you can find in us supermarkets  it s not too salty  it s exactly what caviar should be  the taste is good  and the price is not bad for the amount  but shipping is ridiculous  it s quite close to sushi grade caviar  but not quite there yet  sushi grade would be much more expensive though  good stuff,1,0
4670,i ve been using nexxus in my hair for quite some time now so i may be biased  this does the same thing as almost any conditioner that i ve tried  although it did not leave any greasy residue and did not dry out my hair  it did not leave me thinking that it was such a great product that i wanted to buy and use it again  it does have a very nice smell to it  not overpowering at all  if you want something cheap that conditions then i definitely recommend this  gets the job done,1,0
4669,this is a really nice infusion  with a sweet blackberry taste that is refreshing and not overpowering  there is not much of a vanilla taste that i can tell  however i smell a hint of vanilla as i drink it  the teabags themselves are great  in a pyramid shape that helps it to infuse but with no leaking  i like that it s clear so i can see the herbs inside  i would definitely recommend this tea to anyone who likes the taste of blackberry  although not to someone who is hoping for a distinct vanilla flavor  a sweet taste  but not overpowering,1,0
4668,first things first    i don t remember seeing it sold at this price tag at target stores  maybe food price has gone up anyway  it is the only archer farms trail mix i buy  other mixes either contain non seed mix  such as chocolate  or less variety of seeds  i am a vegetarian  so plant seeds are an important source of proteins  i d prefer less cranberries and raisins  however  the mix is great ,1,0
4665,i think that this series of larabar is what a real healthy snack should contain  if you look at the ingredients on all of this series of larabars  then you ll see that it has only 3 4 ingredients like the fruit itself  dates and some form of nuts  it doesn t have sugar  salt or other preservatives  because of the dates  it has natural sweetness and because of the nuts  it has natural saltiness  the nuts also give this bar it s calories  an average bar is about 200 calories    the taste is well     not like eating a nature valley snack bar  the taste is more like eating mashed fruit and nuts mixed together with dates  if you don t like dates or have a thing against dates  i wouldn t buy any of this series of larabars because 90  of them have dates as a main ingredients  i think they use it as a natural binder  because of this  i find that a majority of their bars taste kind of the same     heavily flavored with dates but  if you re trying to snack healthily and want to avoid processed foods and those sugary   salty snacks in the  snack bar  aisle at the supermarket  this is the bar to go with  plus  if you buy it in bulk from amazon  it comes out to be less than  1 25   bar whereas at the markets it can go as high as  2 00    bar   you just need to go the market and try all the flavors first before you commit to 16 bars of the same flavor at amazon  it would suck to order 16 bars of a flavor and find out that you can stand the taste of it after the fact  this is what a really healthy snack bar is     ,1,0
4662,i decided to try this out after seeing an ad in a bass pro shops catalog  i have two chihuahuas  one of them loved it and could probably lick it all day  the other dog wouldn t go near it  all in all  i think it really just depends on the dog itself  hence the mixed reviews here  it s not a bad product by any means  but probably not something i ll be buying often   just more of a fun treat every so often  really depends on the dog,1,0
4660,i bought this food for my adult male chiweenie and two female chiweeniepom puppies  i researched for a while before finally deciding to get this particular brand  i m glad i did get this brand  my dogs absolutely love it  before buying canidae my puppies were on purina puppy chow and my adult was eating kibbles n bits brand  they were  healthy   but their poop smelled horrible and i knew there was much healthier food out there for them  i gave this to my adult to see if he liked it and indeed he did  i attempted to try and feed him his last bit of  junk  food he had left and he would not touch it  the only dry food he will eat is canidae and nothing else and the puppies love it too  i read all the bad reviews and chose to still buy it and hope for a good outcome and it was good  my dogs are healthier than ever  they haven t had any diarrhea  vomitting  weightloss  unhealthy weight gain  or anything that i have read on the other reviews  but my dogs also have no allerges that i know of either  another plus is that their poop doesn t smell as bad either  i mean in still stinks but nothing like before  i started feeding them canidae on thursday july 26  2012 and two months later they are healthier than ever with no adverse effects and my veterinarian likes it too  great food    ,1,0
4672,the mushroom is fine  many people say bad thing about this mushrooms  it s shiitake is smell like that and taste like that  if u think the taste is weird may be because u eat different kind of mushrooms  if u are looking for shiitake mushroom here you go  you are in the right page  nice shiitake mushrooms,1,0
4659,when our little timothy was hospitalized last spring after an attack of severe awkwardness  we were sad because he d miss easter  his favorite holiday   we thought of surprising him with a pet rabbit  but we hit on a cheaper solution  a fresh whole rabbit dressed up in a sock with little holes cut out for the arms and head would make a darling easter bunny hand puppet bunny looked better ass end up so we drew little eyes on his bum and shifted his ears aft  turns out duct tape doesn t stick to clammy surfaces so we ended up stapling them on    a little lipstick completed the effect  and generous application of air freshener helped mask the raw smell words can t describe timmy s look of surprise and delight when he met his new friend   all the more so because his paralyzing awkwardness lent the whole scene a kind of cringe inducing pathos   things took an alarming turn when bunny refused to come off dad s arm  he d rammed it in so tight the little buck teeth fastened onto his elbow like nails   it took the doctors 45 minutes  to surgically remove it  and when infection set in there were ominous whispers of gangrene  but it cleared up eventually and now we all laugh about the scars   i strongly recommend ordering a tub of vaseline to go with the fresh whole rabbit if you want to try this yourself  1 001 uses,1,0
4684,sure beats melting butter for your popcorn   gluten free  no fats  no calories and hardly any salt  what s not to like   it s superfine so it sticks to the kernels  as well as the real thing without all the mess  you can combine it with all other flavors or your own seasonings too  better than butter,1,0
4686,i recently read both reviews on bob s red mill white popcorn    the one said it was terrible  i decided to take a chance and order anyway  i was not disappointed  it is very good popcorn   we eat popcorn several times a week  and this is good popcorn   i always keep my popcorn in the freezer and take it directly from there to cook    i believe it makes all the difference   this made nice fluffy popcorn   enjoy mp bob s red mill popcorn white,1,0
4709,i ve been using this product for almost 2 years and my dogs seem to like it   however  last box bag had all 96 greenies stuck together in a huge ball   maybe it was the heat or maybe something happened during packaging   either case  i have to pull off 1 at a time when it comes to snack time  last bag had 1 big greenie ball,1,0
4706,i am allergic to soy  so most protein supplements are not acceptable and finding something that is palatable is tough  the original flavor is chalking  but the chocolate powder is actually quite flavorful  if you have soy allergies  this is the one for you  soy allergies,1,0
4705,i wanted the ghost pepper version but accidentally ordered this one but im not disappointed  this is extremely hot still if your not used to it then it ll burn pretty bad the first time was pretty bad as the heat builds but you get used to it make sure you drink something if you feel like theres a fire storm in your stomach very nice hot sauce  nice manageable hotness,1,0
4704,have purchased and eaten a lot of sushi ginger  none have come close to the ginger people organic brand for quality   some reviewers say too sweet  not so   actually the amount of sweetness and spice is just about right   no dyes  no artificial sweeteners  just organic ginger in rice vinegar with organic sugar   i will purchase in quantity again  very good ,1,0

4702,i normally purchase already grown containers of cat grass at my local pet store  however  the last few pots developed bugs in them  which just wasn t sanitary  i bought these seeds from hirts and they grew insanely fast  my cats love the taste  i ve already bought another pack so i can re plant once the cats finish off this batch  my cats love the taste and i love the price ,1,0
4701,i love dark chocolate  and this product did not disappoint   it wasn t too chocolatey  and the nuts made it feel like a pretty healthy snack   i was afraid the sea salt would make it too salty  but it didn t   it was just right  yummy ,1,0

4700,i have used the berry flavor which tasted like medicine so i decided to go with the mint flavor  i took one strip and gave me a kick for 4 hours  but the following day i decided to take 2 strips because i felt more tired than normal  i def had the energy maybe too much   i was at work moving faster than normal and started to sweat a bit because i was moving so fast  so i did have the shakes and sweat  maybe a sheet and a half would suffice  just be careful when and where you take it  good and bad,1,0
4698,i just wrapped up my in office lunch  featuring the barilla mezze penne with tomato and basil sauce  i also brought a left over mandarin orange spinach salad and french bread from home     it was good  really good  but the pasta sauce was almost a disaster the product contains a larger plastic  microwavable bowl containing pre cooked pasta  and a smaller bowl that contains the pasta sauce that rests in one end of the larger plastic bowl   the smaller bowl is not attached to the larger bowl  it just sits in it   both the larger and smaller bowls are sealed shut with a thick plastic film cover to prepare the pasta you pull back the plastic cover slightly to allow venting from the sauce   it s true that it takes only one minute to heat this meal   handy after only one minute in the microwave you pull it out  and then remove the top film entirely   this is where i nearly had a mega disaster   i pulled the plastic cover back  starting at the end where i had already pulled the plastic back to allow venting  and i had to apply a fair amount of pressure because the plastic was attached quite firmly   at this point i did not know that the sauce bowl and the pasta bowl were not connected  and as i pulled back the plastic it came free of one end of the sauce bowl before the opposite edge   the pasta bowl pulled up and nearly spilled all over the counter  but luckily it didn t   that was close ok  with the plastic cover removed and disaster averted  i poured the sauce over the noodles and stirred it up   the portion size of noodles was appropriate for lunch   the amount of sauce was good for the amount of noodles included   don t you hate it when you have pasta  but you don t get enough sauce  that was not the case here   there was plenty of sauce for the noodles the consistency of the noodles was great   they were neither too hard nor too soft for my tastes all in all i would award this product the following rating 5 stars   ease of preparation5 stars   portion size5 stars   food taste5 stars   food consistency5 stars   completely recyclable1 star   chance of spilling the sauce all over the placeall in all 4 stars   and it would have been 5 stars if the instructions had warned me that the larger and smaller bowls were attached and to be extra careful while removing the thick plastic film cover   once you know about this issue you shouldn t have any problems good stuff  just a minor engineering glitch i hope this is helpful  good product  but with one notable design flaw,1,0
4697,my dogs love the nylabones  they last forever    when i first give them the bone i rough up the ends on the concrete and then run water over it  doing this seems to get them going  in fact  they don t show much interest in the nylabones unless i do this  i think maybe because when the outer layer is roughed up it releases the smell and encourages chewing  i will never buy a different brand of bone for my dogs   thank you nylabone for making such a wonderful product  my dog loves it ,1,0
4693,they aren t to bad  i have had other chips that were little sweeter  and some chips that were so dry  that there was very little taste  i would buy here again  chips for light eaters,1,0
4692,first off  i have to compliment amazon on their wonderful delivery time  perfect secondly  the packaging of this product was absolutely adorable  upon opening the package  i noticed the cream was in a pump tube  which is a plus  but it limits the control on the amount i can squeeze out at a time  trust me you will only need about 2 3 or less of the cream that comes out of each pump  in that regard i feel that it is a bit of a waste  but i suppose i can deal with it because it is an all natural product  with that said  the smell is awful  i enjoy coffee smells  and even i thought that some of the other complaints regarding the smell were exaggerations  however  that is not the case  for some reason it does not smell like coffee  it is sort of a nauseating warm smell with a hint of expired butter cream and butter scotch  i know that all noses are different  and that each of us like different smells  but even for me this was too much  if you want to avoid smelling the product while applying  hold your breath and apply away from the nose as far up to the eye area as possible  i would not use it as a moisturizer because of the smell  it has a very emollient texture and it is a bit oily at first  i have oily to normal skin  so i do not use moisturizers  even though i should  it does absorb well though in given time   i rather not take the risk of using this as a moisturizer because it is not diluted enough  as an eye cream it is a good product  i am excited to see the results within the next few weeks and will edit this review regarding the effects of the product  i am very please it is all natural  the other few body products from 100  pure are a bit of a bust for me  but their blush and powder pressed makeups are lovely  smells awful  nice product,1,0
4691,first off  let me say that i m a pretty experienced tea drinker   i ve tried out a ton of different brands of tea  and i make my own tea blend from loose leaf dried herbs regularly   of course  i jumped on the chance to try out a new flavor    blackberry vanilla  sounds great well     the tea does indeed taste great   however  i feel the name is a bit misleading   it has so little vanilla in it that it s basically undetectable  and it tastes far more like hibiscus and raspberry   it s a bit of a tart tea  a direct result of all the hibiscus  and it actually includes raspberry  black current  blueberry  and rose hips in addition to the blackberry  which is actually a minor ingredient   so  the end result is a pleasant tea that tastes fruity  but mostly of raspberry and hibiscus   if you like that  which i did   you ll be pleased  but anyone who actually expected it to taste of blackberries and vanilla will be disappointed   oh  and a bit of advice   if you find it too tart  you can either just wait a few minutes or drink it chilled   i ve found out that the tartness of hibiscus seems to wear off after a few minutes  and chilling seems to kill it off quite a bit too on a side note  i m a bit disappointed in the  natural flavors  part of the ingredient list and the sunflower lecithin part of the list   why do tea companies always feel the need to add in extra fillers and crap   plus   natural flavors  could be anything   it always felt kind of like cheating to me  almost as if they just couldn t craft a pleasing tea without adding in a bunch of crutches to boost the flavor   that being said  at least it tastes good   i can t argue much about that so  do i recommend this tea   if the previous description of the flavor sounded good to you  then by all means  enjoy this tea   if it sounds disappointing to you  then you may wish to let this one pass  pretty good tea  but the name is misleading   ,1,0
4689,i was looking for a cheaper alternative to the high priced k cups so i decided to try san francsisco bay french roast coffee  first  the price is right  i read all the reviews of this brand so i knew what to expect regarding appearance and storage  i must say  it really is not a bad cup of coffee  i usually drink newman s own k cups and  in my opinion  newman s own is a better cup of coffee  however  if you are looking for a cheaper alternative  i would give san francisco bay french roast a try  try a smaller box to try it out first  not a bad cup of coffee,1,0
4688,i m surprised i haven t seen a commercial yet that shows gummy worms wiggling out of the bag and dancing on the grocery store floor  lol   seems like a fairly obvious and outrageous idea that would be wonderful and whacky to implement but  to my knowledge  hasn t been used yet   anyway i remember 5th grade science class and how this one teacher came up with an idea to put gummy worms in chocolate cake mix and we d pretend it s real worms in soil   she d pass out cups of worms cake mix to the kids and we d all laugh   that actually encouraged me to pass science class that year  believe it or not and i wasn t even a fan of gummy worms back then   it s true  i didn t actually appreciate the fine flavor until i was about 20   before then  all gummy related things would stick to the roof of my mouth and cause unsatisfaction   pick up this bag of trolli gummy squiggles today so your friends or students can share the same joys  squiggly worms that giggle in the bag,1,0
4699,for those of you who are freaked out about a little expiration date on the coffee    are you serious   do you know that there is a coffee out there called kopi luwak    seriously  google it   yeah  it is pooped out of a civet cat and sold for 600 bucks a pound   so  really     this is not milk for crying out loud   you all can stop buying it then  and that will be just more for me   now  on to my review this is the best coffee ever   and you can not beat the price   if you poured a cup of fresh brewed into one cup  and then made this instant coffee and put it in another cup  i defy you to tell the difference    in fact  i would lay odds that you would point to the instant and call it fresh ground fresh brewed  more for  me ,1,0
4710,so much of it  i recieved it in an orderly fashion  and it wasn t stale or hardening as it is in most cases  this is still had the soft texture to it and made feel as though the product wasn t old  while i can t state that for sure since i don t actually know if it wasfresh or  a preservative made it appear so  much better in quality and price than i can aquire locally  plus it last a while since no one can tollerate too much licorice at a time  good buy  fairly fresh candy,1,0
4658,i don t know what it is but i have never been able to handle no calorie sweeteners  i ve tried them all  in some it s the aftertaste but in all of them i would get a horribly upset stomach within minutes of ingesting it  i saw a commercial for nectresse and decided to give it a try  i had my first packet of it yesterday in a cup of black coffee  i added nothing else except the nectresse  no after taste at all  tastes just like i used regular sugar  then i waited for the stomach upset  it never came    i believe the folks at splenda have hit the nail on the head  this stuff is good  real good  i ll be using nectresse from now on  finally a no calorie sweetner i can use   ,1,0
4655,good choice if you are looking to stop drinking aspartame this is going to take some getting used to  i m not going to lie   i ve been drinking diet soft drinks for a very very long time  and i prefer them to the hfcs versions this stuff is expensive  and  after one try  i do not like it as much as i like the lime flavored diet name brand cola   it s not bad   just different   and i think i could get to like it   the cola has an almost tea like quality to it  and the sweeteners  stevia and erythritol  are very sweet  the carbonation is on the light side for my taste   it s drinkable  and it has caffeine  so it s got that going for it  weird  but good if you re giving up aspartame,1,0
4622,package arrived very quickly and well protected  the only issue i had was that 3 of the chocolate cups arrived mis shaped  however  i set them in the window for a very short time  and they softened just enough to be moldable  i also think that there was no way to prevent it since the heat wave temperatures were so high the week they were in shipment  i would not have paid for any  overnight  expensive delivery no matter what and any kind of  thermal  packaging would make them too expensive  i recommend these to anyone and will order again  chocolate shot cups,1,0
4621,it s actually 60 3  cocoa solids  not 63 3  as advertised rich and creamy  not too sweet and not too bitter  the ingredients  say it all certainly among belgium s finest  very well done if i had to do it over  i may try the product with closer to 50  cocoa  still  60 3  is certainly tasty and it s probably best to go with the highest content of cocoa one can stand  the higher  the healthier    i probably would not attempt 70  for anything other than cooking   ingredients  unsweetened chocolate  sugar  cocoa butter  soy lecithin  natural vanilla flavor  may contain milk  rich  creamy  neither too sweet nor too bitter  60 3  cocoa goodness,1,0
4620,love this  dont use too much because it is strong  but it tastes great   makes even mediocre salmon taste great  delicous,1,0
4619,i gave it a 4 because my cat did not take to this at first   i almost thought i had bought it for nothing   then i put it with her other treats and she started nibbling on it and now i gave her a handful this morning and she seemed to eat it all up  i think she will get used to it and like it better   comes in a paper package  though  not the container shown here  strange  but she finally likes it,1,0
4617,i purchased a hot air popcorn popper because my kids love popcorn  and it s a healthy snack i  accidentally  ordered the white popcorn  having no idea what i was doing  and i have to say that no other popcorn compares  we went through the entire container  when i re ordered  i decided to try the regular yellow popcorn  and it just wasn t the same  if i could describe the difference  i would say that yellow popcorn tastes  stale  in comparison  the white popcorn tastes crisper and more fresh as for the flavor  well  we use kernel seasons seasoning generously  so we don t taste much more than the cheddar cheese   i m considering giving the rest of this yellow popcorn tub away so i have an excuse to buy another tub of the white popcorn for how we eat it  this popcorn is absolutely the best note  i also recommend the misto oil spray  we use this and kernel seasons as a healthy alternative to butter  you must try this popcorn,1,0
4616,havista s  3 4cm  dried shiitakes have a slightly smaller average diameter than havista s  3 5cm  dried shiitakes   the big picture is that there wasn t much difference between  3 4cm  and  3 5cm    i counted about half as many 5 0cm to 5 5cm diameter dried shiitakes in this product as i found in havista s  3 5cm  dried shiitake product   the tiny 2 5cm to 3 0cm dried shiitakes were slightly more numerous in this product than havista s  3 5cm  product   apparently  havista believes that kilogram for kilogram  their tiny shiitakes are worth slightly more than their larger shiitakes   interestingly  the japanese believe just the opposite   in japan  the largest shiitakes are called   donko   and separated from the rest to be sold at a higher price per kilogram than the rest   the quality of these dried shiitakes is about as good as any other brand of dried shiitakes   about 1 mushroom in 30 to 50 might be defective  taste sour or look decomposed    that s not worse than other brands   these dried shiitakes will fully occupy just slightly less than 5 1 2 one gallon plastic jars   product of china caution   havista s dried shiitakes are extremely rich in vitamin d2   without even contacting havista  i can tell that these shiitakes received plenty of sunshine where they were farmed   i get hypercalciuria  calcium sand in my urine  after eating only two thirds of the dried shiitakes in a 1 gallon plastic jar   hypercalciuria is a symptom of hypervitaminosis d  vitamin d overdose   these dried shiitakes have a slightly smaller average diameter than havista s 3 5cm shiitakes,1,0

4613,oh  i ve never owned a full tub of chocolate ice cream before  it s not all that bad  and the ingredients are only mildly offensive  but they seem a little skimpy on the sugar  maybe they can re formulate it with splenda  or something to make it really offensive  but sweet oh  come on you guys  this is the modern  competitive darwinian world  can t you take a little well intentioned teasing  it s obvious you re doing your thing for darwin by seeing how far you can push the envelope of nearly unnatural ingredients  add sugar to taste,1,0
4611,i find this works way way way better for cooking sauces than full sodium soy sauce  the normal stuff often overpowers everything  while this complements  i always buy this over the normal  even though i am not terribly concerned about my sodium intake  tastes better than full sodium  especially for cooking,1,0
4608,first  i ll discuss what i like most about this bottled water  the taste   then address some of the other issues i read from other reviewers i love the taste   most bottled waters taste like most tap waters       bland  i have preferred dasani  by coca cola co  due to its light mineral additive package which gives it a pleasing taste   likewise with this essentia 9 5 ph drinking water  very pleasant taste  no taste negatives and in my judgement  no aftertaste i like the 1 5 liter size in the durable smooth clear bottle   2 liter bottles are a little too big for packing around   other smaller sizes are often not very economical  or because of limited size require carrying more than one bottle   this 1 5 liter weighs about 3 pounds when full and is a nice size in my estimation the price is admittedly higher than the no name bargain bottled waters  but neither is this perrier priced  and i do not find the price to be excessive for a quality  tailored water i really can t speak much to the  magic elixer  claims regarding the ph  if i did  i think i d be just making stuff up  i do  however  experience some infrequent heartburn  usually depending on what i ve eaten  i had no such digestive problems after drinking the essentia 9 5 ph  maybe coincidence  or maybe the water helps  the idea of a basic ph water to balance an excessively acidic stomach situation has some merit  it would take longer for me to develop a more sure opinion i like this water  i d be willing to buy it regularly  love the taste   other issues  ,1,0

4606,this water has a nice taste and the bottle is nice and sturdy to hold  what else to say about this water  oh yes  the ph  i did not feel any different after drinking this water than i do after drinking any other water  it did absolutely nothing to even try to blow my socks off  and the asking price is too high for it to be so mediocre  this water didn t come from some rare source so the price tag is unwarranted  so why the 4 stars  because it tastes like good water  as it s supposed to  if it were sold for the same price as sam s club water then i d buy it   also  i think i ll stick to gatorade as opposed to expensive filtered tap water when i need electrolytes  taste is perfectly fine  don t know about the ph thing,1,0
4604,of course taste is always subjective  but i have a really touchy stomach and ginger altoids nearly never fail to alleviate the queasiness  if you don t like strong  slightly burning tastes  stay away  if you do    you will love  em  for queasy stomachs,1,0
4602,i ve been getting these regularly for a year because i liked the idea of using splenda as the sweetener   just last month it was  15 40   now it s  17 81   that is a price hike of over 15    i don t know if arizona iced tea company raised their prices  or if amazon decided to really increase their profit margins on this item   however  it is absolutely dirty pool   a decent product that just may have lost my loyalty  and my business  the price hikes are criminal,1,0

4612,i received the order in a timely fashion and got the most recent manufactured date  so no   it was not stale    would do business with anyone who carries the now label   haven t taken it long enough to give it my review  but will at a later date   1 vitamin manufacturer in my book,1,0
4657,the facts    tastes like crushed seeds    texture like crushed seeds    looks like crushed seeds    mixes about as well as crushed seeds starts to settle after a few seconds  my opinion    love it    this is the only protien powder i have found that doesn t have ridiculous amounts of sweetener  none in fact    taste is somewhere between broccolli and seedy nuts   not delicious but not bad tasting either    it settles quickly   no big deal   swish the container when you take a drink    be sure to rinse your container so that the dish washer can take care of the rest    don t use too much at once because it has a lot of fiber  no sweetener   love it ,1,0
4627,i will definitely buy the san francisco bay coffee again   after i try the other flavors  i will use the subsription plan after meeting my husband  i started drinking darker roast coffees  and this fog chaser was bold and delicious   but the biggest reason why i tried this brand was because of the lack of the extra plastic   i ve felt bad about the excess plastic that was being discarded with k cups   i ve bought a wide variety of gadgets that are compatible with keurig  all in attempts to reduce waste   some had a re usable cup with small inner paper filter   which i still use when i acquire my own ground coffee  others were caps that went over re used k cups after they were emptied and rinsed   but that all takes time that i don t always have   i feel better that these have less waste plus they re less expensive than regular k cups   a subscription will make it that much cheaper the box has separate bags of 8 coffee pods each   i don t think maintaining freshness is an issue for me  since once i open up a bag  i simply put them in a sealed plastic container   there is one plastic container included in the box  but it s a little on the flimsy side  certainly not tupperware tough  but it s still enough to store these   i drink one to two cups a day  so the opened bag doesn t have a chance to sit around long anyways this fit perfectly in my keurig machine  too i d definitely recommend this to others  will buy again    ,1,0
4630,i thought this was supposed to be the  healthy  soup option  but it s just come to my attention when shopping for some other soup brands that the ingredient  natural flavors  this soup contains  is a cover word for the main ingredient in msg which is responsible for causing unhealthy effects  free glutamic acid  the food industry uses words like these because they don t want you to know the truth about the unhealthy ingredients in the food  as they would get less buyers  i know i wouldn t have bought this if i knew  this is where i read about it         get rid of the spaces to paste in browser besides this  i really think it is a delicious and comforting flavor  which is why i have bought this many times    it is too bad i can t conscientiously get it again knowing about this  natural flavors  labeling scam however it is fair to say that this is sort of the lesser evil as far as instant soups go  for example the other gluten free soup i was thinking of getting was thai kitchen curry rice noodle soup http   www amazon com thai kitchen bangkok instant 1 60 ounce dp b000gzsi7g ref pd rhf gw p img 1and it had four glutamic acid ingredients  natural flavor  hydrolyzed soy protein  disodium inosinate  and disodium guanylate   this is why i give this one 4 stars  the point is that we should not fool ourselves into thinking this product is healthy  it should definitely be avoided  contains msg    free glutamic acid ,1,0
4652,this product is excellent  having tasted and bought a 600ml bottle in thailand  koh samui  the only problem i have with ordering was i didnt know the actual quantity i would be receiving  it did say one of  but i think i payed  41 australian for a 300ml bottle which i received in the mail  i thought i might ve been receiving one dozen bottles which does seem more realistic  i am waiting to get my visa card statement  hopefully it was 40baht i paid  instead od aussie dollars  see what happens  yours ian   the unknown   ,1,0
4650,please  tell me loyal amazon readers and customers  this is a curious question of mine   who in their right mind  or rather  what kind of person would spend 10 dollars for an 8 pack of hot dog buns   because when one factors in shipping and handling  that s the ridiculous current price   is it people that don t have a grocery store in their town  lol   so they have to rely on online shopping   maybe people in other countries looking for american food  which is a hilarious thought considering how terrible and junky the food sold here in the states is    maybe some people can t actually drive either because they re physically unable to or simply don t have their license  so they can t travel around in search of wonder hot dog buns   i m speechless right now   there has to be a reason for the high dollar food prices here on amazon  not a wonderful price to say,1,0

4640,love the chex mixthis product has a mixture of things and puts them in one bag there are several sizes  but i prefered the small bag   this is my personal experience  i would bring a dollar to school  then purchase a small bag out of the vending machines  i would do this at least once a week  probably more because i didn t have time to eat breakfast   i would save it until general art and eat it during class   the teacher allowed it   then finish it up during lunch  the lines were huge and i wouldn t be starving because i ate my original chex mix i bought the only flaw is that the increase of the original chex mix can be from one dollar at some gas stations  to four dollars at other gas stations   if you don t get as hungry as often then this is not the product for you  if you do get hungry and it is not even close to time to eat then you should try this product overall  i think this is a delicious product  love the chex mix,1,0
4639,not sure it should be legal  we put this   and a few other spices i won t share here  on some lamb chops and just fried them  they were amazing  this spice tastes pretty hot by itself  which makes it a bit hard to figure out how a blend with it and other spices is going to turn out  the end result  strangely  was not hot at all  since i like spicy  i would usually have been disappointed  but this was so good  i did not even care  seriously  you have to try this  i ordered two other spices at the same time  neither of which will be getting a good review  what this does for lamb    ,1,0
4637,i m a snack fiend  and finding something i can snack on that s also healthy is a godsend  i suppose some people want dried fruit to be the consistency of beef jerky  but i think the fruit tastes better if it s not dried to the consistency of shoe leather  apricots and prunes are my favorites  prunes are just what you would expect them to be  sticky  so have a handkerchief or wet wipe for use afterwards  the description above says pears are included  but i think it must be a misprint  the packages say peaches  and dried peaches are really good  they have a tartness i don t normally associate with peaches  i m not as crazy about the apples  which are limp when dried  but they still taste good  even if they feel a bit strange i m surprised more parents haven t tried these as after school snacks for their kids  these are sweet enough for the sweet tooth in your family  healthy snack that actually tastes good,1,0

4635,when i saw the hot label on this beef jerky  i jumped on this great deal  when i opened my first package  i was somewhat disappointed to discover that it s not spicy or hot at all  i barely eat spicy food or hot  but if you advertised hot it better be hot  i hope the company plans to add a little more spice to this great beef jerky because i am now a loyal customer because of the great tasting organic beef  taste great  however  it s not spicy ,1,0
4632,since i really like gummy candy  i didn t have a problem with the 5 lb  bag   the taste was better than the typical gummy bear or worm i can buy at a grocery store   i would have preferred that the worms were longer  but oh well  they actually are better than typical gummy worms,1,0

4775,i ordered this tea because i saw something on dr  oz about drinking pu erh tea as part of a weight loss tea drinking regimen  i liked the flavor of the tea  i did not however see the supposed weight loss effects of the whole tea drinking thing  i will not blame the tea for that  though  there are too many variables as to why i did not see the results  as for the tea  it seemed to be a little stronger than a regular black tea such as lipton s or something comparable and i enjoyed that  i would definitely consider ordering this tea again when i finish the box i have  good tea,1,0
4774,i have been ordering this as a  subscribe and save  for months now  and have been happy with the product and the quality that i receive   however  the last order i received  which arrived in a sealed box  contained two punctured bags in the box  though i imagine they are probably fine  they could have been tampered with or they could have been infested with bugs  unfortunately  i m not sure what can be done about the problem  so i m writing this review   it may make me reluctant to continue placing orders through amazon  good product  recent problems with packaging,1,0

4771,oh  egg nog  when red leaf tea first contacted me  asking what flavors of matcha i d be interested in trying  my immediate response was this  egg nog  oh goodness  egg nog  please  oh please  egg nog  when the holidays come around  i miss it with a burning passion  there s just too much cream in it for it to be worth the risk  unfortunately  we have been able to find soy nog  but it s just not the same  but i have to say  it does the trick when i m really just dying for a cup of nog  it certainly brought my father in law and me closer last christmas when he was always more than happy to get me a glass of soy nog so he had an excuse to grate fresh nutmeg on top  he cracks me up so this matcha had high  high  high expectations to live up to  it was delicious  very much so  but a little weak  i got a hint of eggnog flavor that was greatly overshadowed by the flavor of the matcha  which isn t a bad flavor at all  it just isn t what i want when i drink egg nog  maybe a little soy milk will bring out that creaminess for me and give me that egg nog flavor i crave  nog nog noggin  on heaven s door    ,1,0
4778,this 20x20g bag of vinacaf eacute  instant coffee was received as a gift   at first i was a bit trepidatious about drinking a product from vietnam   it was left in the cupboard for a few weeks unopened   i was not sure about the food preparation standards in vietnam   however  after trying vinacaf eacute   i was surprised at how good it was   i went through all 20 packets very quickly   each packet already has instant coffee  creamer  and sugar mixed in   you don t need to add anything vinacaf eacute  is pretty good  equal to american brands   however  remember vinacaf eacute  is made in vietnam   they may or may not have the same food preparation standards as the usa   until i learn differently  i would still buy vinacaf eacute   surprisingly good instant coffee,1,0

4767,the only reason i got interested in mangosteen juice is the claim that it brings histamine levels down  my 20 mos old is allergic to histamine and i don t want to give him antihistamine medications  since he still breastfeeds 3 times a day i also started drinking this juice   i previously bought cheaper brands   dynamic health and smart basics because of lower price  i have to say  this one from genesis today is way better  doesn t taste bitter and is not diluted with so much water than others  it is expensive   but i will buy another bottle if i have to  this time from vitacost  i think is worth buying  it seems like it works for my son   until my irresponsible husband ignores my warnings and feeds him with food containing spinach or tomatoes which are high in histamine  great tasting juice,1,0
4766,i was dreading ordering pepper online because i had no idea how long it would have been in the warehouse and how stale it would taste  i was pleasantly surprised because this still has a peppery kick and does not have the cardboard like taste that stale pepper has  it s also a great price compared to the ripoff that is whole pepper at the supermarkets  peppery and flavorful,1,0
4765,i used to order kalamata olives in small containers by the case through a food co op   since retiring downsizing and moving to a large city i do not have the storage space for case orders even when they are available   however  one small container won t last long here   this large jug available through amazon was a good buy for me   this arrived in a large box with other ordered items   however  it was securely wrapped in plastic   this was a good thing since about a teaspoon of liquid had leaked   the lid was on tight and there was no evidence of mishandling   the liquid never went beyond the plastic wrapper   the olives are fine  good buy,1,0
4764,i have been having stomach problems for the last six months   not the kind of problems that would send you the doctor just alot of feeling bloated and uncomfortable   after taking this for just the first five days i felt like a fog had lifted from around my body   i feel more alert  the bloated feeling is gone  and my energy level is noticeably increased   towards the end of the ten days i did appear to pass something that looked like worms   i know its gross to talk about looking at that  but it is even more gross thinking about worms living and feeding inside your body   i have since learned that even though the worms seemed to pass when i went to the bathroom  there may still be eggs in my digestive system waiting to hatch   like others i plan on doing this again just to make sure  bloated feeling is gone,1,0

4761,i quickly received the sweetleaf steviaclear liquid that immediately mixes with liquid as opposed to the powder form  also i like the fact that there is no maltodextrin or other such unhealth additives that are in other stevia products such as stevia in the raw  sweetleaf steviaiclear,1,0
4768,i bought this kit after i really enjoyed making the tropical riesling from the same manufacturer   it was equally easy to make  but it is very peary   i wouldn t have minded it if it was more subtle   still very drinkable  but i suspect that i ll be mixing it more  not bad  i like the tropical riesling better,1,0
4760,this was one of my college staples  i had at least 5 of these a week for years after a while my parents said that it contained trans fat i initially ignored their claim after reading the package and seeing  0g trans fat  however  i later read that food manufacturers may put 0g if it contains up to  5g  there are two servings in this package  which is why they can say that it is  trans fat free   if it only listed one serving  this product would have to say 1g trans fat this is still my favorite microwavable noodle product  but i no longer purchase it  unnaturally occurring trans fat is simply not good for you  no matter how delicious  should this product ever remove the trans fat  i would rate it 5 stars and go back to eating it every day look for partially hydrogenated oils in the ingredients  it s not worth it  one of the best microwavable meals  but beware of trans fat,1,0
4779,i dont think a lot of pet owners realize that the reason raw hides are cheaper is because your pets can choke on them   they can rip chunks of the stuff off while chewing and it will expand after they swallow and choke   there have also been many cases of raw hides being contaminated with salmonella especially those imported from china   i have a friend whose little maltese got salmonella from a little raw hide stick off those cute christmas gift bags   she got lucky and got better but it took a couple of months and was on lots of anti bionics most shelters   rescue groups will not accept raw hides as donations  so although bully sticks and tripe are pricier  they have better nutrition as well as safety for your pet   as a precaution  make sure they are not imported from china  bully sticks vs raw hide,1,0

4804,first time buyer of ka me rice crackers and i m very impressed  these are very light  crisp and flavorful  they are as good plain as they are with cold cuts  fruit  etc  unfortunately  the ones i purchased may be the last i get from this source  right after i purchased the dozen packs  the price per dozen increased 44  to its present  37 99  fortunately  i have enough to last a while  but assuming the price stays the same  these are my last ka me  crisp and delicious   extreme price hike,1,0

4799,ok  look  if you are hoping for typical american pasta  you re going to be disappointed  if you are a fan of asian fare  specifically vietnamese  you ll find these to be a great rice noodle substitute  so listen  if you ve never had them before  go to a local vietnamese restaurant  order bun or pho with rice noodles  hate  em  don t bother ordering any of this kind of noodle  like them like i do  and this is an awesome substitute  but do not expect typical flour based american pasta here  if you do  you ll likely be unhappy  you need to understand the style,1,0
4797,my wife and i have been purchasing and using sweetleaf liquid stevia for approx 3 years  auto purchase the 2 pack  4 oz bottles  monthly    until recently  it was marketed in brown bottles and the liquid was crystal clear   about 6 mos ago the packaging changed to green bottles and from the very first shipment  there was a white suspension and white mucus around inside of cap and rim of the bottle   that said  we still use it  have not noticed any change in concentration  still use 5 to 6 drops equivalency to 1 teaspoon of sugar    it has not been watered down and we have not seen black suspension or mold as other reviewers have indicated   and  we ve not noticed any symptoms one might expect if the congealed substance was anything toxic   our guess is that some of the stevia extract is congealing due to a manufacturing process change   hopefully  wisdom natural brands  the manufacturer  will rectify this and return it to it s crystal clear liquid   until then  we re still using the liquid  ignoring the suspension and enjoying the  sweet  life   if you really can t handle the current product  check out now brands stevia   it s priced about the same and  while we haven t tried it recently  it s probably still crystal clear   hope this helps  sweetleaf liquid stevia changed something about 6 mos ago ,1,0
4795,bought a couple of boxes tonight at the local supermarket and after trying one  they were not bad at all  the seafood salad actually tasted like fresh seafood salad  and not slop in a can  the crackers were pretty decent too  overall  a good snack or light lunch for work  not bad at all ,1,0
4794,i have never tried brick tea before  so i am going through a learning process   not bad for the most part  but now i need to try other types to compare this with  a new tea adventure for me ,1,0
4780,this is the only brand that i have confidence in  it s made in the usa and its ingredient sources are quality   there are 4 ds of meat products found in typical pet food productss  dead  dying  diseased  or disabled sources   halo does not use 4 d meat products in their pet foods  i haven t read that other pet foods follow that rule so i make sure to stick with this brand  one note though   there used to be visible blends of peas  carrots  herbs  and other veggie sources in there and they really scaled that back to just kibble now with maybe one pea or carrot in 8 cups of kibble    so i have to wonder what else they skimped on  i wrote and complained and they basically offered me a coupon for my next purchase rather than discuss the change in quality of their product  and their price went up about  5 from what it was for the 30 lb bag since i purchased the month prior    so what gives    hey  if you price shop  you can find deals that provide 10 15  off and free shipping so keep that in mind  only brand i feed my dogs,1,0

4787,i m a big fan of very bold  very dark coffee and have tried literally dozens of bold k cups timothy s midnight magic  rainforest espresso  emeril s and tully s french roast are also dark coffees that i will buy as well but this one has the best flavor for me  it is not bitter and muddy looking  it s smooth  most importantly  it gives a flavorful  not weak cup of java on the 9 5 ounce setting  not many k cups do that  they become coffee flavored water at the 9 5 ounce size  this is probably my favorite k cup,1,0

4783,when i received my box and opened it  there they were a nice layer of cookies ooooo my family and friends just enjoyed the cookies until i got down to the next layer  they were all opened and crumbled  i do love them but i paid for 120 pack of cookies and only enjoyed way less than half  i sent an e mail asking for a refund or a replacement box but never heard back  loved the swiss cookies but most were damaged,1,0
4782,i tried this brand because my cat had a tooth pulled and it was hard to bite hard food  this freeze dried chicken is white meat and easy to chew and swallow  i ve never seen my cat react so favorably to a treat before  she goes nuts over this  it s not a soft food  but a freeze dried texture  it is a treat  not a substitute for food  but it s healthy and with no additives  better value online at amazon too  real chicken white meat freeze dried,1,0

4759,we have a 16 month old cat who suddenly got flutd   for about a month  she looked very uncomfortable and desperate to urinate  and was making a rancid mess of our house   she would spend the entire day going back and forth to the litter box  straining and straining  and then leave one drop of urine in the most unpleasant possible places   on our couch  our bed  etc   it was awful   almost every day led to high stress discussions about whether she might have a life threatening blockage   visits to the vet and internal medicine specialist cost us  3 500  and led to a complicated  expensive drug regimen   the  3 500 of vet analysis basically concluded with  we don t know why it happened  and it s really not fixable  you just have to manage it    they recommended a special diet food sold solely through vets   it was ridiculously expensive   we looked out at a 15 or 18 year time horizon  and thought  man  that is just insane   i mean  if you have a 15 year old cat and you re facing a year or two of special diet food  then ok   but a whole cat lifetime of prescription food  only after other approaches have been tried so we picked up a case of this food  along with purina s dry food for flutd cats   and that very day  her flutd stopped   period   she has not had a single  solitary incident of straining or sign of discomfort since   it s been about two months and  both she and our other cat  who has no flutd issues  love this food   they stand at the bowls and meow for it  in a way that we have not seen them do for any other food   sadly  this food is only offered in one flavor  chicken   so our plan was to feed it to them for as long as they would tolerate it  and then integrate in some other non flutd foods  to give them the variety that cats usually demand   well  they have eaten this one flavor every day for two months  and they continue to lick the bowls dry and empty every single day    and still stand there meowing for more of it  the next morning   insane   so far  so good  and this seems like a fantastic product  amazing flutd cat food,1,0
4758,this item was the first to arrive of several flavors ordered  it was also the first opened and used  i didn t take long to empty the 3 oz bottle  more needs to be applied than one would initially think  but it is in line with the instructions on the packaging very good caramel flavor  it really enhances the salty flavor too so you might want to back off on the salt added to popcorn we used with an oil popper  very good flavor,1,0

4727,bought these because they were different than any seeds i had seen  they don t really have a bacon flavor in my opinion  but they are still good  i eat them sometimes instead of my dill seeds  recently changed from spitz to bigs  bigs are better seeds  enjoy not really bacon flavor but good,1,0
4726,my wife an i are pretty much hooked on these cups   i was a skeptic at first i must admit   i tried the san fran cups  and didn t really go for their style   i was getting tired of paying an arm and a leg for the main brands that got this whole biz going  so i tried these cups from brooklyn bean roastery   i originally ordered the columbian blend  and admittedly i thought they were ok  i also thought they were a little weak for a medium bold roast   i reflected that in my original review of that one flavor   the company immediately offered email assistance  to help me choose another flavor that would better meet my taste preferences   i never did respond back to that request as i was not really looking for any assistance   it was merely my first impression and observation   i got through those cups and decided to give the brooklyn bridge roast a try   i liked these much better   then it happened     i had a couple of those cups more or less pop their tops in my coffee brewer   it was a mess and a pain in the caboose to clean up   i had known of other customers complain of the same issues  but again i reluctantly gave these a try hoping that would not happen to me   well  it did   i then signaled the company with a review  reflecting what had happened  and the company immediately sprung to action again  wanting to resolve the issue i had  and desired to make me whole   i never once thought that i would really get the attention that i got from the company  nor did i solicit any new product directly from the company   it s like going to a grocery store  and buying any one of a myriad of items   i believe that it is something you take an inherent risk  if you ve never bought that item before   if you don t like it  lesson learned   you just probably don t buy it again   you don t run back to the store  demanding a refund  or contact the manufacturer and expect anything well  brooklyn bean emailed me  and basically summoned me to give them a detailed explanation of what happened  what cups i was using  the expiration date  which translates to the manufacture date  etc   after giving them that requested info  i even sent them a photo of the messy exploded cup  they emailed me back and unexpectedly offered to send out new product   i thought  wow   this company must be serious about making it in the business   they are trying to make right  what had gone wrong  and at no expense to me  they sent out new product  and then some   they sent out replacement cups  and also a 16 cup sampler pack   we tried all of them and my wife fell in love with the vanilla skyline   we have since ordered more product  including the vanilla  and each cup has performed flawlessly     i emailed the company and thanked them  and added that it surprised me that they would go to that effort for me  just one lousy customer in utah  and their response back was  how could a company not stand behind their product  and make it right  if they want to make it a successful company   that is music to my ears   i told them  that not every start up company would do that so  i highly recommend this product   find the flavor you like and run with it    even great in utah ,1,0
4725,reviews were mixed on the eight o clock columbian i liked it   i liked it very much and will buy more  in larger quantities it smelled good  tasted good and didn t give me rot gut 3 hrs later but  coffee is very subjective i recommend buying one bag locally and if you like  you buy more   if not    well    then don t   lol coffee if very subjective    but i like this stuff,1,0

4731,i have been looking for low carb pasta for a while  i tried shirataki pasta  but i did not like the texture  i heard of this pasta on the internet  i did research and decided to try it out  when cooking this  it is better to cook it a shorter amount of time  that is what makes it low carb  also one thing i read was  reheating this pasta will mess the chemical balance up  i am not sure if this is true  but i would stay on the safe side  so i would recommend cooking it when you are ready to eat  and not reheating it  i am not sure if this is really low carb  there is no absolute way to find out  this also does not work for every one  trying it before you buy six boxes would be a good idea  i would recommend this to a friend who is trying to watch their carb intake  happy with this product,1,0

4732,hi well this is a really good tasting product  i was so happy with it until i opened the bag for the 3rd time and out ran a pretty good sized spider  sort of brown and red i think it was so fast it came at me i threw everything up in the air and it hit the end of my kitchen counter and dropped down so fast i couldn t get my composure and kill it  so i hope it isn t dangerous for us  i will still finish the bag after i have my husband dump it all  look inside for any other stow aways  but really it tastes really good and i will continue to order it unless i have this same experience again then i will seek out a different supplier  eek,1,0

4734,maybe i don t have as rich a pallet as the others that have reviewed this tea  but it did nothing for me  it was very bland on the pumpkin side  just matcha to me  i added some cream and sugar  and ended up having to add a lot for me to get it down  for me  if i m adding more than three spoonfuls of sweetener  the tea is just too bland for me i was actually really excited for this tea  i expected something really rich and decadent and a  kick in the mouth  kind of flavor  i had high expectations when i opened it  it smelled really delicious and i was excited  but i ended up just pouring my cup out and setting my packet up on the self  maybe i was making it wrong  maybe i added two much water   well  i ll be trying again until it runs out  but i wouldn t buy it again  i wish they had a smaller trial size that wasn t twenty dollars   edit  i gave it two stars at first  but i m raising it to four  four and a half if i could  i was making it wrong and with a good shifting of the powder and a good shifting of the tea it s self  plus some sugar and cream  the tea is quite  dare i say it   delicious   even decadent  now that i know how to make it correctly  i d certainly buy another  larger portion  so just be careful of the directions  unlike yours truly  okay  better than  eh  ,1,0

4750,i like my keurig   the only thing i have to say is that in my haste to purchase this product  i may not have investigated my purchase very thoroughly which is what i will do from here on out   i learned a very valuable lesson this machine has a selection for two cup sizes  5 25 or 7 25 oz  neither of which are very large   and you can t really use a k cup twice   trust me  i tried other than the small sizes i like my keurig   so i can t blame the machine because it is what it is  nice,1,0

4745,i m not one who goes out of his way to find  organic  foods   i try to watch what i eat  but an organic designation isn t a must for me  so when a friend suggested i try dr  flynn s granola  i didn t rush to order   my mistake  i eat a fair amount of granola  and i ve tried various brands  but this one simply tastes better than any of the others i ve tried  and that s my test for reordering  which i plan to do regularly  just tastes better,1,0
4744,it tastes great  made with real sugar  not high fructose corn syrup  so this is healthier compare to the american coke cola but still don t drink too much of this stuff  i give this pack a 10 out of 10  mexican coke cola 12 pack review,1,0
4742,i ate two chews twice daily for almost three months  and here are the results  my total cholesterol went from 241 to 184  hdl from 75 to 68  ldl from 153 1 to 101 8  tgl from 67 to 71  the ldl needs to drop to 99 or lower  but still a major improvement and the tgl  although it increased  is still below 150   my hdl risk dropped from 3 2 to 2 7   i only made one change to my diet and exercise routine  and that was to eat less cake and cookies  which i believe contained eggs  the yolk    i tried and will continue to use benecol chews because i do not like the side effects from statins  other prescription cholesterol lowering drugs  and over the counter remedies  supplements  etc     the chews taste like caramel candies and two chews contain 35 calories  so that s 70 calories in total per day   i may consider taking one more chew a day  hard to believe  but it really works ,1,0
4740,this wasn t in stock the last time i looked  i had to go to the vermont country store in weston to find it along with a jaw harp  cranberry horseradish sauce  fartless black bean salsa  apple cider jelly  newton s cradle art in motion and the staple vermont maple syrup back to the ass kickin peanuts  they are hot  they will activate the perspiration glands behind your ears and under your arms  it requires a beverage as advertised  a glass of very cold milk  and a box of kleenex since it will make your nose run  they look like ordinary peanuts which is already giving me ideas for work  i suspect that some people have been hitting my goodies in my absence  especially my colleague greg  i m going to take this to work at earliest opportunity and empty the contents of this can into an ordinary planters peanuts can  and then see whose crying or whose nose is running when i return the can should be shaken to ensure the spices are evenly distributed  it is important to wash your hands after consumption and not touch the eyes you ll go nuts over these ass kickin  peanuts p s  i m not sharing the peanuts  not deliberately  and i ll probably give greg the jaw harp for christmas  he ll be so insulted  you ll go nuts over ass kickin  peanuts ,1,0

4738,i was a nutella fan until i saw this on the shelf at the local whole foods   thought of giving it a try  although more expensive than nutella   and wow     thank goodness i tried it   tastes way better than nutella   yes  it is not as sweet as nutella but i think that s how it should taste   too much of sweetness in anything is sick   it is also not as greasy emulsion like  as nutella   it tastes more hazelnutty than nutella  and it does not have artificial anything in it unlike nutella which contains vanillin   nutella is not an inferior product but surely not better than this one  way better than nutella    ,1,0
4737,sun chips are a healthy alternative to potato chips   they are made from a blend of whole grains  corn bran  and sunflower oil   it s hard to find them in grocery stores except as an item mixed in with other chips  such as doritos  fritos  etc   some words of caution   amazon lists a variety of sources   the cost of the chips plus shipping averages out to about  20 for a box of 30 one ounce bags  sources offerring lower prices have higher shipping costs    the quality may vary  depending on the source   individual reviewers have not indicated the source that they used  so it is necessary to check the ratings for each source  a healthier chip,1,0
4736,i loved the flavor of these cups  and i would order again for sure but i would check the price first  i really thought it was too expensive but i had not tried this flavor before   it was good stuff  great flavor,1,0
4735,this must be a taste thing reading some of the other reviews   this is the 1st salsa with 7 peppers that you can taste each variety with a nice long burn but not too hot   i loved it   now i have to buy it on line since not a single chain store has it in northern virginia  you can taste each pepper ,1,0
4808,my mom and i bought these some years back  from world market  we chuckled at the names and decided to give them a go  we couldn t believe they actually tasted like their given names   volmit  earwax   yuck  these were a good laugh and a fun experience  the names fit the flavors,1,0

5798,i m a lousy cook and i know it   however  when my kids and i grind a little garlic and red pepper over my otherwise bland food  it actually tastes good    it even makes my thursday night spaghetti border on gourmet ish when i also include a little fresh parmesan    i ve tried some other blends from our supermarket  but nothing else tastes as fresh or balanced as drogheria   alimentari   it s not too hot for my youngest   she s 8   but it has a enough kick for the rest of the clan having said that  a little of this goes a long way   you might want to split an order with some friends to try it   for our family  though  we like it so much we have it on our subscribe and save list  help for a lousy cook,1,0
1369,i purchased sweet leaf vanilla creme flavored liquid stevia after i decided to switch from my other no calorie sweeteners to stevia   my first word of advice is to look at the vanilla creme liquid as a flavoring  not your complete sweetener   i like to use it in my ice tea and it only takes a couple drops in a big glass  maybe the whole dropper for a pitcher   i use a plain sweetner for the actual sweetness   if you use too much  that is where the after taste will come in   it took me a few tries to get it right if you buy this to add a bit of vanilla flavor  you ll be happy  but if you buy it to use to sweeten your coffee or other drink  you will not like the after taste  a little goes a long way ,1,0
470,i use this product a lot  i cook brown rice in washingtons instead of water  so that it has taste   i only use one envelope to two cups of water  so as not to add too much sodium  i use it instead of broth as a meatless alternative  love this stuff ,1,0

1372,i have four dogs ranging from a 7 pound chihuahua  a 30 pound chinese crested  and 2 mixed dogs  15 and 25 pounds    three of them are rescue dogs and for some time now i have been feeding them what the rescue was feeding them  taste of the wild by diamond   i was paying over  45 for a large bag of dog food that recently had the largest recall by diamond   my dogs are my babies and i have never had a scare like this before   i never knew diamond brands was known for recalling their pet foods   after researching the internet for brands of pet foods that have never had a recall  i was shocked and impressed to see that purina dog food was the only one that never has   they have had recalls on cat foods but never on dog food   at least from the articles i found online  if you don t believe google  brands of dog food that has never had a recall   purina will be listed first what i found interesting is that to me all dog foods smell  disgusting    it might look appetizing with the different shapes and sizes and pretty colors but i always wondered how they can eat the stuff   when i fed my pooches the taste of the wild  they always left food behind in their dishes   since feeding the purina beneful all four dishes are left empty   i know purina is considered the more  middle  brand of animal food  but it has been around for years and most important my dogs love it   i will continue to feed them the purina beneful and give them daily vitamins and healthy treats to make sure they meet their daily recommended nutrition   there are several varieties to pick from and plan on mixing things up for a little excitement  i can t rate taste  but my dogs love it ,1,0
1373,i ve used this flour for nearly 20 years   it s higher protein properties lend its self nicely to perfect bread baking   however      read the product details carefully   this is for an 80 ounce  5 lbs  bag of flour     that s  seven times higher than the price at your local grocery store   furthermore  under item description  this product is listed as having a shipping weight of 41 pounds      so this seller is profiting on shipping by a lot on top of the product its self  buyer beware,1,0
1374,my dog really loves these bull sticks   the smell is not so bad when opening for the first time  and definitely goes away completely after a few days i recommend this product to other potential buyers  my dog loves these  ,1,0
469,if i had noticed there was a date on these dog treats before i purchased them i would have checked it  ater feeding my dog almost expired and now expired treats i wasn t happy   you  can t sell 6 bags of treats with an expiration date on in this case one week   when i looked back on bags i bought previously   jan 2012   they had an expiration date of 5 2011   of course i only had two left so i dumped them  but i was feeding my pet dog treats i purchase in jan  2012 that expired in may 2011  fool me once shame on you   fool me twice  shame on me   will not order these treats through amazon again  unless i am guaranteed free return shipping if the treat expiration if not at least 3 mths ahead of the date of purchase   thank you for listening old and expired,1,0

1377,i first tried dimitri s at a bar in seattle   i had to know what they were using so i could find it for myself   i ordered the three pack and was not disappointed   making bloody marys from scratch can be time consuming  messy and one may taste good and the other not so much   this takes all of that out of it   perfect for the morning after hangover the only reason i gave it 4 stars versus 5  it s not spicy enough for my taste   this time i m ordering the extra horseradish version  we ll see how that fares  so good  not spicy enough,1,0
1378,not bad for conditioner  although please note this review is only after one use  i need not love the smell at first as it spilled in the plastic it was wrapped in  but i liked it better after smelling on my hair  i have thick semi long hair  and i felt it did as good a job at conditioning it as any other comparable condition for this price range   like pantene   i did not think it was the best conditioner i have ever used  and the smell was not pleasant enough i would go searching this out on my own  not bad  though i would balk at paying almost five dollars for this in the store or on amazon  not bad,1,0
468,i was impressed with this shampoo   it has a nice mild scent  not overpowering at all   it works just as well if not better than many of the top salon products that i ve used since 1973 when i became a hair stylist and i ve tried almost all the major salon quality brands   i have curly  dry colored hair   i didn t think my hair felt stripped at all like one of the reviewers said  or coated   one person gave the shampoo a poor review because it didn t cure her dandruff and burned her eye   plain water will burn your eye not to mention any other shampoo or soap and it s not a dandruff shampoo my scalp and hair feel as good if not better than any of the major salon brands that i ve used over the years   my guy friend uses it and he has fine thin hair   it works just fine for him to   i really like the shampoo and have just ordered the conditioner to try too  salon quality,1,0
1380,i ve used stevia for close to 20 years now  i put it in tea  coffee  on fruit salad and in baking  some people claim that stevia has a bitter aftertaste  and some brands can have that problem  but not this one this stevia is finely ground and exceptionally pure  the label states  under supplement facts stevia extract powder  leaf   stevia rebaudiana  min  80  glucosylsteviosides   other ingredients  none  stevia extract is hypoallergenic and contains no sugar  salt  starch  yeast  wheat  gluten  corn  soy  milk  egg or preservatives some people claim that stevia is 200 times sweeter than table sugar  in my experience  it is about 8 times as sweet  if you have never used it before  i wouldn t start with a 1 lb  container  i d start small  such as the one ounce size as for baking with stevia  for puddings and pies  you could probably get away with using it as your only sweetener  but for cakes  cookies and muffins  it won t give you the same texture as sugar and doesn t work for that except as a supplement to other natural sweeteners such as coconut palm sugar  high quality stevia,1,0
1381,this may seem a little expensive if you compare it to store brands like friskies  etc  but if your cat is like mine it is worth it  no longer do i throw uneaten dried up food away   sometimes entire cans  he loves this stuff and there are no pesky fillers to get in the way  it is also good for thyroid health  only food my cat will eat ,1,0
467,this brand is sold at trader joes for 2 00 each  i was hoping to get it cheaper here  it s tasty  still too much sugar  but less compared to its competition that i have found so far  it has the little aloe chunks in it too  less sugar compared to other aloe drinks,1,0
1367,this bar is nothing but nuts held together with a really nice substance that is sticky enough to hold the nuts together  but is not hard to chew at all and does not get stuck in your teeth   i honestly didn t taste much vanilla or much of any kind of spices  but it definitely has an all natural taste   we re especially glad to find a bar with such a low level of sugar   the calories are a little high for this small of a bar  approx 1 1 2  by 5  and they are 210 calories per bar  and i m not someone who can just stop after eating one of something i like  so that could be a problem   but  if you have enough self control to just eat one  this would be a really healthy and satisfying snack to have  very nutty,1,0
1383,my cavalier spaniel immediately took a liking to the bone  it lasted about a week  which isn t a bad value considering the price  found a bulk listing on amazon for case quantities and bought that instead  better value price wise then buying individual bones  good bone for small dogs,1,0

464,i have used the tropical flavor for the last 11 years  yes i realize that the formula has changed  does it taste the same  close enough for me  does it taste awful  no it is not awful whatsoever  is the same performance in this jug  yes it is  it still delivers a great performance boost  now i must say  that i have literally never tried any other flavor at all ever  the tropical tastes just as good to me now as it always has  the choice is yours  but i recommend this product with no reservations bg new formula is just fine,1,0
1384,i ve been using prosobbe soy formula and breastmilk  my baby had serious acid reflux    i decided to change to this formula for 3 main reasons  1  no added corn syrup  as for soy formula has 55  of cs  2  she is very constipated  hoping this will work 3  way cheaper than paying 28 30 bucks very important to read the label   corn syrup is a  seriously quiet health risk for babies over time  i thought about organic but about 29 formulas were tested with a high level of arsenic which is extremely harmful for babies  unfortunatly  the name of the formulas tested were not disclosed  i gave it 4 stars bceause i still need time to see my baby s reaction  also  i found the formula for 22 bucks at walmart  does not contain corn syrup   ,1,0
463,i haven t eaten kraft mac and cheese for years because it wasn t organic and it was filled with chemicals and flavorings  etc  so i figured it was just something i couldn t have  and the organic brands at the grocery store were ridiculously expensive and tasted awful  well  after reading the reviews here  i decided to give the back to nature organic mac and cheese a try and i wasn t disappointed  it kinda felt like a treat to be able to eat it again  i didn t have regular milk on hand  so i used buttermilk instead and that gave it a really good  tangy flavor and seemed to enhance the cheese flavor as well  i did the subscribe and save option  so each box averaged out to about  1 65  i will definitely be ordering again  tastes just as good as the blue box ,1,0
1386,i was worried about those negative comments about expiration date  but my local costco did not carryany of this  and those at starbucks stores were too expensive  so  i gave it a shot and ordered italian roast 50ct on 6 20  they arrived on 6 23  and the expiration date is 11 23  which leaves a plenty of time to drink all of these goodies    expiration date is good,1,0
462,my dog loves these  and i believe  and hope not to be disappointed  that the newman s own organics brand is to be trusted the treats are small  and no doubt healthy  but i wish they listed the calories on their package  the ingredients are all good  but i m trying to control my older dog s weight  and if these were very high calorie  i wouldn t feed them to her  i d look for something else   i know  carrots and other veggies  but she won t eat them  she s a 9 year old rescue with terrible teeth  and set in her ways  my past puppies found baby carrots a great treat  but not this girl  maybe i ll contact the manufacturer and ask for the calorie count  but i do think it should be on the package  good treats,1,0

1390,i drank bailey s irish creme for years and thoroughly enjoyed it  i saw this brand at my local liquor store and asked another person picking up a bottle of this brand what they thought of the two in comparison  they liked carolans better  i bought a bottle to try and i find it smoother and cheaper than bailey s  it has the same rich flavor  i have tried competitive brands of other liquors before and been disappointed that they tasted  watered down  or were harsh and went back to the standard  i won t on this one  great taste,1,0
456,this remains close to the top of my list for favorite cereal   no high fructose corn syrup  low in sugar and salt  the cereal is just sweet enough   the pieces are small and crunchy but not hard   the cereal holds up pretty well in milk but not so well in the box   the last 25  of the cereal was shredded vs  squares   this makes a fine dry snack and offers a good alternative to less flavorful  more expensive whole grain cereals that may appeal to adults but definitely not to children  crunchy oatmeal,1,0
466,i have tried several brands of chai tea  and have been disappointed   they have either been too heavy on certain spices  had an odd aftertaste  or not flavorful enough   this tea doesn t suffer from any of these problems   richly flavorful with no odd aftertaste  and excellent made with either water or milk  excellent tea,1,0
1391,the half wheel papillon roquefort arrived via fedex chilled  using reusable chilling packs  hello  injured athletes   reusable foil bag  reusable durable carton   the taste and and fall apart creamy cheese texture are indeed supreme  however  this roquefort cheese s lingering taste is that of being over salted   the salt simply overwhelms roquefort s purpose  creamy bulk  distinct blue breaks   this product would go well with group wine or beer tastings  crumbled over salad or pasta   i rate the product 5 stars  as not all eaters share my aversion to preservative salting  and not all eaters have experienced roquefort francais clint williams authentic roquefort,1,0

1340,it s very difficult to tell if this product is working  i applied it around my deck to repel rabbits  we have them in the yard  and sometimes they hover around the hostas around the deck  i haven t noticed any rabbits near the house since application  but we had rain nearly every day for a week  so i m not sure if the product is effective anymore or not  i also sprinkled it around one of my gardens that doesn t have a fence to deter rabbits  groundhogs and moles  since i don t have a camera set up  and i m not monitoring it round the clock  i just can t tell if it s keeping all or some of them away when i sprinkle it on  the product has a very strong smell of black pepper  it s easy to apply  but doesn t go very far  it s a little expensive for me to purchase for additional applications for those wondering what the other 99  of inactive ingredients might be  i m 99  sure it s sand  so  this is black pepper  piperine  and capsaicin  and a ton of sand  if they made it in a liquid that customers could mix with sand for spreadability  i wonder if they could make it at a better price  i think it works  but that s hard to measure,1,0
482,this new flavor of zico is delicious   silky and chocolate y without the gag inducing traits of some of the other fruity flavors   great as a post workout substitute for chocolate milk or a banana   my little case ran out quickly as my husband discovered it and loves it  too   however  i went to re order the same exact item and was shocked to see that the price of a 12 pack jumped from  21 51 to  53 95 come on  amazon  really   this is obviously a hot item at the moment  but you re letting your sellers get away with blatant thievery   what a disappointment  chocolate coconut water scalpers,1,0

1345,i was so surprised to like this  i love normal coconut water  it s practically all i drink  but when i saw this  i was a little scared  chocolate coconut water  it sounded so gross  but it doesn t taste much like coconut at all  in fact  the first thing i thought of when i tried it was eating cocoa puffs  it tastes a lot like the chocolatey milk    yummy ,1,0
1346,after trying the bran buds version of this cereal  i thought i would give these a try   while a little lower in fiber from the buds  i think this cereal falls short when compared to the buds in another way   sogginess in milk with the buds  they could sit in milk for minutes without ballooning up and turning to mush   these fine strips of bran however  turn to mush within a minute of sitting in milk   seriously  the crunch is gone in no time and thereby making it harder for me to get down i ll finish off the pack and return to the buds and get my 11  more fiber and a few more minutes to eat them before they get mushy  not as good as the buds  40  fiber vs  51   ,1,0
1348,got a box of 10 on sale  all 10 popped very well and without a lot of unpopped kernels  it didn t taste like movie popcorn  but it was pretty good  the only weird thing is that it smells funny while being popped  like wet dog  i m not kidding  either  it smells like wet dog  perfectly acceptable popcorn ,1,0

480,i ve tried many different dry foods with my chihuahua mix  she does okay with them for a little while  but then won t touch them  even when she ll eat them  she takes her time and is not enthused at all  i decided to try a canned food to see if it might be more appealing to her  and since i like wellness i tried this first  i started by mixing it with her dry food  but she went straight for the wet food  picking around the dry  she would eat some of the dry food at the end if i stood there and watched her  i kept this up for a couple weeks  then switched her over completely to the canned food  since my cat was eating her dry leftovers  she still gobbles it down after about a month  and still licks the bowl clean every night  i was concerned about switching her over to a completely canned diet  as i ve heard not feeding dry food can cause problems with the teeth and gums  but i think brushing her teeth and giving her dental treats will be sufficient  it s nice that now she eats her whole meal within a couple of minutes  so i don t have to watch the bowl and make sure the cat doesn t eat it for her  i m sticking with the turkey recipe for now  but if she starts getting picky again  i ll try the fish recipe  good for picky dogs,1,0

475,i used to buy these at my local costco but they only carried them for a short period of time   now i can t find them anywhere and certainly am not paying  20 a bag like sold here   complete rip off when at costco they are like  5 69 for the same size bag   i guess i ll have to wait for costco to bring them back    amazing chips ,1,0
1355,this is a nice grind of salt with a strong truffle smell taste    it is on a par with the truffle butter i buy at dean   deluca   would buy again  nice truffle flavor,1,0
1356,i love this stuff   i put it on just about every thing i eat   it s the perfect amount of heat  but not over powering   my only complaint is the packaging   of the 12 bottle in my order  2 had been busted open and went everywhere  this stuff turns in to concrete when it dries so it was quite a task to clean the remaining 10 bottles  i realize that this may be more of a complaint better directed to the shipper  i e  ups   but as the customer  i feel this is amazon s battle to wage   on that topic  i submitted this information to amazon  along with a couple photos of the mess  but they never even responded with a confirmation  let alone offered a partial refund   i m not sure why amazon even bothers to offer a way to submit satisfaction issues if they just ignore it regardless  still a great product   i might suggest you just buy it at your local grocery store instead of purchasing it here since there s no guarantee you ll get every thing you paid for from amazon  great product  but poor packaging ,1,0
1357,i bought a can of this baby corn from whole foods last week to try it out before committing to 6 cans the color  texture and taste of the corn was good  so i am back at amazon to buy the 6 pack  good quality corn,1,0
1358,this product has helped greatly with digestive issues   the flavor is not bad   the texture may take a little getting used to but i would recommend this product  worth the purchase,1,0
1359,this is a great dog food and our dogs do very well on it   particularly  no gassiness as with some other brands   another reviewer mistakenly said that this food was made by diamond pet foods  who have been experiencing product recalls   i took the time to email wellness and asked them if this core dry dog food is produced at diamond pet foods   here is their official response   core was never made at diamond  we have spent the last 2 years expanding production at our mishawaka  indiana facility to bring the majority of our production into our own wellpet facilities   our facility includes a state of the art onsite quality and safety laboratory and advanced extrusion systems all designed to produce the most nutritious  high quality natural pet food possible  with a focus on food safety and compliance with regulations   our goal is to have all of our dry food made in mishawaka buy the end of 2012  if the core is not made at mishawaka it is made at american nutrition or vitaline  so do not be duped by ignorant reviewers who are quick to spread misinformation and do not take the time to back up what they are saying   i hope everyone who has second thoughts now has them dispelled  not produced at diamond   do not be  conned  by other reviewers,1,0
474,they work very well but they are not as pictured they do not fit the holding base and they lids are all different everything works well they srew to the pump but not as pictured good but not as pictured,1,0
473,the spaghetti with turkey meatballs is better than many others in the hormel line in some respects and worse in others  my biggest complaint about the hormel red pasta sauces is that they are all unfailingly too sweet and have a distracting acidic tang to it  this one  thankfully  doesn t have these issues at all  it is a very nice tasting sauce  a little bland but that s par for the course with this type of meal produced to be enjoyed by many different types of people  that pretty much makes the entire dish  the noodles are noodles  nothing exceptional  nothing horrible  it s the meatballs where this meal fails  i understand that they are attempting to make a lower calorie meal and applaud their efforts but these turkey meatballs are terrible  they are overly dry and have pretty much no taste  maybe if the meat was ground up and mixed into the sauce  this wouldn t be an issue but instead they are in fairly large chunks as a whole though  i would rather eat this meal than many  many others in the hormel line up  it still has way too much sodium  600mg  but comparing that to some of the other meals  upwards of 1300mg  it s much  much better  if you re looking for something that doesn t have to be refrigerated  is quick and easy to heat up  and is fairly palatable  you really can t go wrong with this one  just cut up the meatballs first and mix it in with the rest  it ll be much better that way  one of the better hormel meals,1,0
1361,this isn t some sweet candy like sugared pineapple  so if you want that  look elsewhere  this actually tastes like pineapple  and i love fresh pineapple plain so this really appeals to me  i love that this isn t sugared and actually tastes like pineapple,1,0
472,i hate to get up on a soapbox here  but i didn t feed my daughter baby food   when she was very young  i gave her whatever fruits and vegetables i was having in a mesh feeder  and i ground up meats in a simple  hand cranked baby food grinder   that didn t last long before i just cut up everything  soft  of course  in very small pieces  and then there was no looking back   i would regard prepackaged baby food as only a fallback item but if you need or wish to use prepackaged baby food for any reason  hey  no judgment here    baby gourmet is as good as any  but at over  2 for a 1 2 cup container  it seems way overpriced to me   i do like the convenience of the foil package with the integrated feeding straw   this particular variety tastes like pear ground up with grass  i e   not good at all   but it s a good idea to mix fruit with vegetables  so i m not really complaining about it   i just don t find anything to particularly recommend about the taste overall  this is a nicely packaged  quality product that most mothers won t need often  if ever   but  depending on your situation  it may have a place in your life  if you really want and or need to use baby food and you don t mind paying a ridiculous price    you could certainly do worse  cool packaging concept   but is this really a necessary product ,1,0
1362,it s the little things that make all the difference  our 11 week old son prefers enfamil  or rather his gi prefers it  i was shocked at how quickly formula turns sour  and adam will not tolerate refrigerated formula over 24hrs or room temperature bottles over 1hr  powder is a pain  concentrate and ready to feed cans make too much  and single serving 4oz are not enough  these 8oz ready to feed are just right  and cheaper by volume than everything  ready to feed   there is far less waste being poured down the drain  travelling to grandma s house  no need to pack ice  just throw a couple of bottles in the bag and go  daycare has a couple in his locker for backup  how much of your formula ends up in your infant s belly  little things,1,0
1363,i purchased these grains a few weeks back  there weren t very many in the small plastic envelope and i wasn t sure how this would turn out  well  they are finally multiplying and i was able to get a first decent batch yesterday  they still have a long ways to go to produce a pint or two a day but at least they were alive and are doing well  i expected more for the money  but in the end  i got what i wanted  kefir is starting to do well,1,0
1353,this gets rid of your kp  i have a bad case of kp ever since i was younger  it is so embarrassing and people always asked what was wrong with the skin on my upper arms i was willing to try anything because nothing  no cream  no scrub has gotten rid of it until i tried coconut oil  i wish i could tell the world about how this has been miracle for me trust me just buy it    read this if you have keratosis piliarisis   ,1,0
1392,someone told me that chipmunks are becoming an endangered species  but not in my neighborhood   they were having a free for all in my flower garden   since using critter ridder  i haven t seen them and there s no evidence of digging   though it doesn t make any claims about deer  they haven t eaten my impatiens so far   havahart has a pleasant odor to humans  kind of like cedar  but apparently is umpleasant to animals   a humane solution of pesky animals  it works ,1,0
455,i ordered this caramel  and in the beginning i made a huge mistake and gave it a 3 rating because even though i thought i was doing everything right i wasn t  i have learned so much from practicing with my caramel apple maker  it deserves a 5 rating now that i ve learned what to do for you novices  use fit fruit cleaner to get the wax off of the apples  then make a mixer of half lemon juice half water and wipe the apples off with it allow to dry before dipping in caramel  this will help caramel to adhere  also  do not dip the apples when the caramel is really hot  i believe the  magic  number was to dip them when the caramel was approx 86 degrees  place in fridge for 15 minutes after dipping and then take them out   i do not like my caramel apples cold   but if you do  they can be left in the fridge this caramel is by far the best one sold on amazon or any other site  it tastes just like rocky mountain choc factory caramel  and theirs is homemade i give it a total 5 stars now   exactly like rocky mountain chocolate factory caramel apples,1,0
1393,i had a cat that kept pulling up my radishes and basil  i put this down and it hasn t been back  however  the main ingredient is black pepper  i m convinced that this is 90  black pepper which you can find at any grocery store for way cheaper than the list price  i personally wouldn t buy this item for the list price  does its job but you can find a cheaper alternative,1,0
1421,i generally don t give my dog food with corn or other grains because dogs are not supposed to eat them  i actually didn t realize that this food had corn until it arrived  i didn t read the list of ingredients carefully and since it wasn t the first ingredient  i was excited and quickly made the order my dog usually eats high quality food   either all natural foods or home made meals consisting of raw meats and vegetables  she loved this food  and ate it right away  she doesn t do that with typical dog foods unless she s really hungry so i think she enjoyed the taste  4 stars was because it has grains in it   and soy   pretty good,1,0
439,when i adopted two kittens two months ago  i started them off with a combination of canned wellness canned cat food  kitten recipe  24 pack of 3 ounce cans and dry chicken soup for the kitten lover s soul   chicken soup contains grain  and after doing a lot of research on the healthiest food choices  i decided to try a grain free dry food   i started with evo cat food 15 4 lbs   the cats loved it  and i continued to mix it with wellness canned   after finishing the bag  i decided to try wellness core  since the wellness brand is so highly regarded   although they loved it  they immediately had awful diarrhea   i can t prove the connection  of course  but the timing  as well as the fact that both kittens were affected  leads me to believe it was the food   following instructions on various websites  i did not feed them for 24 hours  after four days of diarrhea   and then gave them a bland diet of rice and broiled chicken until their stomachs were settled   i am now back to evo although dry wellness core did not work for me  i have full faith in the quality of the brand  and i continue to feed canned wellness to hopefully save others the time on some research  i ll suggest a few other highly recommended  nutritious options you may want to consider grain free dry 1  orijen regional poultry and fish grain free dry cat   kitten food  5 5lb2  merrick before grain  1 chicken dry cat food  11 1 pound baggrain free canned 1  evo cat   kitten canned cat food2  merrick before grain  1 chicken pat eacute  style cat food  5 5 ounce can  24 count case  a very nutritious grain free brand  but gave my cats diarrhea,1,0
438,i love this drink  tastes just like yoohoo  sadly  i saw the price jump and figured i should just buy it at my local whole foods   until i realized i can t find it there anymore either   i don t know if it s being discontinued or what happened but i hope to find it again soon  and not for almost  60 a box   price jump on line    can t find in stores     what happened   ,1,0
1424,i ordered these as a cart filler  they were around 3  at the time   price as i write this review is  35 20 for some reason wasn t expecting much  maybe a tiny packet of half soggy caramel flavored mess what i got was a tray holding about 24 small  very crispy  crepes   they didn t taste like salted caramel  just a pure sweet caramel flavor  they were about 2 bites each  and were absolutely perfect with a cup of hot cocoa after a rough day it s a shame they aren t available at the same price  they would be worth buying in bulk next time  definitely a surprise ,1,0
1425,we all know how picky cats can be   it may be grain free  but food still smells  looks like  and fine details in label indicate  highly processed  with all the extra vitamins   minerals  which i think is the  turnoff  for the kitties  doesn t say up front  but also contains new zealand green mussell  which i am not sure how that ingredient fits in as i am not from new zealand  but suspect locals rely on that for nutrients as we do mussells in this country   they are spoiled on the real thing   minimally processed or raw rabbit  chicken  bird  wild caught salmon   they will eat canned only if minimally processed   another cat food bites the dust but gives the dogs another treat  1 star for not knowing about the new zealand mussell   for still being highly processed   therefore unpalatable as food for cats that love rabbit  5 star for a dog treat without the added hormones  grains  etc  neither cat will touch it    but dogs go wild   5 star for dog food treat,1,0
437,i bought this exact product previously for under  22 and now it is nearly  54   what happened   the natural and the mango didn t sky rocket   was is a successful product and now they plan to take advantage of their customers   i can do without it at that price  price gouge ,1,0
1426,i grind these and put them in my protein shake as well as my paleo candy   the calcium in these is very high  i don t drink milk and don t believe in calcium supplements  these will give you about 98  of your daily calcium in about 1 4 to 1 3 cup ground  they don t have the bitter taste that you get from tahini that you buy in the store  more people should look to this for calcium especially if you are vegan  sesame seeds unhulled,1,0
1427,i have never had a carnivorous plant before  not even a venus fly trap   the title of the product does not reflect the completeness of what you receive   it contains the plants  the fibrous soil  netted pots  and care instructions   you will need your own reservoir  bowl  for the plants  but that is it   the order also included instructions on how to pot and care for each plant  a must have for any beginner only had them a few days  but they arrived very healthy and the seller contacted me with the expected delivery date to make sure the plants were not left on my doorstep in weather that was too hot and or humid finally  the price point was competitive   this was a must for me since i did not want to commit a huge investment and am not an avid gardener very happy with my little meat eating plants  everything you need to start a meat eating garden,1,0
1428,this stuff actually has the taste of oranges   it absolutely is not like an orange flavored soda or sports drink   if you drank it without knowing what it was  you might mistake it for a cheap store brand oj from concentrate  or perhaps one of those orangina drinks minus the carbonation   there sure are some clever mofos working in the crystal light laboratory and as usual  this crystal light is made with just the right mix of different fake sugars to not have a fake sugar taste   these things are a perfect way to pass on a large soda with your meal without having to settle for plain water or icky diet sodas  good  actually has a bit of real orange taste,1,0
435,i bought this for my 3 month old puppy  thinking it would keep her busy and entertained  it took her about 20 minutes to figure out that she could lay in her bed with the bottle tilted against the side  and the food would keep coming out if she just moved it periodically  i ended up giving the toy away because she was able to be too lazy with it  i gave the toy 4 stars  though  because i doubt this would happen with most dogs  quite frankly it shocked the heck out of me when i saw what she was doing  i liked the design  but my pup s too smart for it,1,0
1429,i have flowers planted on the opposite side of our sidewalk next to two trees which are a magnet for male dogs  it makes me disgusted that people let their dogs urinate on my lovely flowers  but i can t stand guard 24 7  so i decided to try this product i must say again  i cannot watch 100  of the time  but each time i ve seen someone walk their dog past  they have not stopped to do their business on my flowers anymore since using critter ridder  the best part is that this product is mostly made from hot pepper  so there s no harmful chemicals or nasty ingredients going into the soil  i would definitely recommend this product  love that its a natural product   dogs pass by my flowers without stopping now ,1,0
1430,if you have not tasted these  then you do not know what you are missing  and the price is super low compared to what one box cost in your local grocer  only thing  is mine was chock full of mostly cheezeit crackers and pretzels  i had to eat the whole box before i found a few crunchy bagel chips and rice balls  for shame  best snack you can buy ,1,0
1431,the larger bags of these are not as good as the smaller bags  even my 2 year old agrees  the pieces are smaller and there s not as much seasoning on them as the 3oz bags or whatever size the smaller ones are  it won t take long for us to eat these but we will buy the smaller sizes from now on  sad because these were a little less in cost  oh well  good but not as great as the smaller packs,1,0
1432,the first taste you get is banana  not peach berry   but it comes after the banana clears your palate  if you don t like bananas  you might not care for this  but we love bananas and this smoothie is fantastic    i bought this on markdown and would recommend it  even if paying full price  it s very high quality  sooooooo goooooood  ,1,0
1420,i must say that i have tried different energy drinks and this one takes the cake   i recently had to get off pain medications in the past 2 weeks after surgery   i had awful withdrawal   one of the symptoms was during the 2nd week  you experience depression and just feel exhausted   this morning  i decided to try a sample someone sent me and i have been running ever since   however  i think it tastes a little gross   almost a medicine taste   but since it is all natural ingredients  i feel safe taking them   so i m getting ready to buy a supply of them   i don t know how long they last but i hope it lasts all day   yesterday blew having to sit around feeling lousy   today is a good day just because of this energy shot   awesome  thank you to whoever made these things   xoxoxo    kim awesome energy shot ,1,0
1433,these are great   we are on our second batch of these candy drops   the quality of the product is so much better than we expected   the eating experience can be described as a consistent cinnamon flavor while you eat them  not too strong  not once but twice,1,0
433,i became a big fan of  jamaica  juice after being introduced to it in mexico a few years back  so i had to jump on this when i saw it  it tastes very similar to real hibiscus juice  and is not too sweet like a lot of hibiscus concentrates are  it s slightly tart  but not as much as cranberry juice is  it s not bitter either  i use this in italian sodas  and couldn t be happier with it  tastes like real hibiscus juice,1,0
1436,this is very bad tasting so i grind it in the food processor and make my own pills with vegetarian capsules   i take it twice a day  very nutritious  seaweed,1,0
1437,i have eight cats   i try to buy a variety of canned food as the vet said cats need to have canned food as well as kibble   they all seem to really like the ocean whitefish   i like the pate  ground up  rather than the chunky stuff   they just drink the juice with the chunky canned cat food and i end up having to give the rest to the dogs  ocean whitefish,1,0
431,i poured me a can of this drink into a glass to enjoy the flavor   my first reaction was its bitterness  it s espresso afterall  followed by a sweet but not too sweet aftertaste   there s a suble creama left in the glass like an espresso would have  but lacking any grittiness this drink defintely provides a jolt of 155 mg of caffeine for those on the run   its contents contain coffee  sugar  potassium bicarbonate  and potassium citrate   each small can has around 50 calories i prefer a coffee drink with a slightly less bitter taste   but for someone who needs a fast caffeine fix  this should fit the bill  quite a jolt ,1,0
1438,they should just put this in the product information    it s not a  16 pack  of treats  but 16 packs of treats   there are 4 treats per package  for a total of 64 treats   so if you re wondering what you re getting for the price  that works out to a little more than 50c a treat  independent of shipping costs  it s 64 sticks,1,0
1439,the theatre butter has nothing on this  or perhaps this is the same butter they use  u will njoy this product very good stuff,1,0
1440,this is a fun way to try a variety of flavors and brews   the price makes it possible to try flavors i would not have purchased as boxes of single flavor  fun,1,0
1441,this product does have a nice flavor  however  it is somewhat more granular than regular splenda  also  i don t think that i would it for baking purposes overall   not bad though  not bad  but regular splenda is better ,1,0
1442,i was feeding my small dog purina one   but he prefers ray s nutrish chicken formula as far as taste goes  he did not like ray s  just 6  formula as much  my dog prefers racheal ray s chicken formula over purina one,1,0
1443,this is not the brach s caramel of old   the flavor was 5 stars but the consistency deserved only 2 maybe 3 stars  was not creamy and chewy that a quality caramel should be   will not be reordering this item  good   not great,1,0
1444,these crackers came very fresh  well flavored a little pricey but  a good buy   will not be embarrassed to serve to anybody  crackers,1,0
430,i love cereal  i also like vanilla and frequently put a splash of vanilla extract in my coffee although this cereal sounds perfect  i didn t like it that much   it wasn t bad  but it was not my taste   i am giving it 4 stars because  although i didn t like it there is nothing inherently bad about it and taste is so subjective anyway  here are some pro and cons  really  pros and cons about a cereal   it can be done pros crunchy  softens slightly in milk  yet doesn t turn into a slushy mess widely varied textures that make it really nice to chewgluten free for those on a restricted dietcons taste was a bit too vanilla for mesticky when eaten dry out of the box  not great for snacking  crunchy  lots of different textures  but a bit too much vanilla,1,0
1445,this cereal is very yummy  however  for those prone to cavities or have deep groves in your teeth  beware  this easily sticks to your teeth and requires spending time with floss and toothpicks to remove  simply brushing does not do  it also has a lot of artificial dyes and flavoring  the dyes will make your bowel movements green for several days  no kidding  this happened to me and my husband   with that said  i till keep eating this cereal at a minimum  i ve also been having some stomach problems  not sure if it s related to this  really good but   ,1,0
429,the conditioner ingredients are unremarkable   chemicals plus oils from almonds  coconuts  soybeans and sunflower seeds  many conditioners have a similar smell   not a heavy perfume   just that of a typical hair product many conditioners now have bottles with lids at the bottom  this is no exception  the bottle is elegant and simple   not fat   so it only contains 12 7 fl  oz   375 ml   yet is the same height as a 25 4 fl  oz   750 ml  bottle   clever packaging to make you think you ve bought more than you really have  what differentiates this conditioner is its consistency  it is neither too thick to pour nor too runny to drip  it has just the right creamy consistency that makes it easy to rub into the hair i have thick  dry  over treated hair that can be quite brittle  the conditioner performed as well as the conditioners that typically come with hair color  i have used a paraben free simplyu conditioner from walmart that i like better i compared this conditioner with dove daily moisture therapy conditioner  dry rough hair  40 ounce  pack of 2  and garnier fructis conditioner  fortifying  pure clean  normal hair  13 oz    both of these were thicker and in both cases i had to put water in the bottle to dilute them   so they probably will last for more shampoos per fluid ounce  or milliliter  than the clear scalp and hair therapy conditioner  which i have not had to dilute i don t wash my hair every day   so the idea of a nourishing daily conditioner doesn t appeal   however i do use conditioner once or twice a week  it has left my hair manageable  just as any other good conditioner would this conditioner is not one i would rave about  but it does have excellent creamy consistency that makes it easy to apply   i like paraben free  very simple products  this has about 30 ingredients   are they really all necessary  creamy conditioner that flows well out of the bottle,1,0
1434,other reviewers have written that using these traps instead of mothballs requires patience and extra effort  freezing and or laundering your clothes  possibly repeatedly   and might require a long time   so i won t say too much about that   i will mention that these aren t harmful to pets  search for  mothballs dogs cats  for more information    also  they have no nasty odor after comparing the reviews for these with the pro pest traps  it seemed as if the pro pest traps worked better for most folks   so i ordered one 2 pack of the safer brand and two 3 packs of the pro pest i put one of each brand in two of our closets  you can probably guess the result   wouldn t you know it  the safer brand drew in far more moths  at least at first i suspect that the different brands use slightly different lures   maybe there s more than one breed of clothes moth and one lure works better than the other for some kinds  but that s just a guess the two traps also differ in convenience  or rather its in     this one requires that you remove a tiny lure chip from its envelope without losing it  and drop it into the trap so it sticks to the gummy surface   i wasn t sure whether it would harm its effectiveness if i touched the lure   the directions are kind of skimpy   so i used tweezers   this process isn t really any harder or easier than removing the finicky release paper on the pro pest traps  so take your pick unlike the pro pest traps  there s no obvious way to hang these   i looped a string through the triangle and tied it to the clothes pole in some of our closets   in others i used double stick tape  which was a little easier although these safer traps drew more moths sooner than the pro pest  the latter eventually began to fill up too   so while i suggest that you try both and see which works better for you  i doubt that you ll go very far wrong with either   just as long as you re patient  worked for me,1,0
440,my dog actually liked these treats  i usually try and give away when she rejects new treats  i love the made in use  they smelled good and she eats them when i soak them in water a bit so they soften up  this is my second purchase and i bought 2 bags but was charged  28 for shipping  outrageous  this is the second time amazon has murdered me on shippping costs when i reordered an item  although i like the usa treats be careful they dont soak you for the ship   i am looking elsewhere now  watch your shipping costs or  they will get you ,1,0
441,the only complaint i have is that you should have not taped the boxes together because when i pulled the tape off it was stuck to the boxes   it pulled the paper off the box  and i was not happy about that  kellogg s frosted flakes,1,0
1418,what i like about this product   made with better ingredients  frosted but not too sweetadmit it  we all love pop tarts but those things have way too many unnecessary ingredients and sugar  i was so happy nature s path provided an alternative  i love the acai flavor  it is not too sweet but still satisfying the need for a sweet tooth  not too sweet  better pop tart,1,0
1394,i remember this sauce when i was growing up in philadelphia  i was not disapointed  it tast s great and brought back fond memories  i ve ordered philly cheese steaks all over the south but no red sauce  now i make my own  remembering philly,1,0
1395,in the interest of full disclosure   i m not a huge nut fan   usually  i will skip brownies  cakes and other items that have nuts in them   i m willing to eat them by themselves but i find they kind of ruin other thing people stick them into   further  i m trying to lose weight and usually nuts can be a good way to go the kind nuts and spices nut bars are part of the kind healthy snacks line   they are very upfront about pointing out the use of only 5 grams of sugar  or less  and nothing artificial   further internet research shows that they keep the sugar levels low by using spices   in this case  its madagascar vanilla the bars are very tasty  not too heavy and rather filling for what volume they take up   they are a little sticky  the plastic wrap they come is is surprisingly strong  and the bars themselves really do taste well for the amount of sugar i will point out that the bars i had boasted 16g of fat  14 g of carbs  5 g dietary fiber and 7 grams of protein   from weight watchers standpoint  that s 6 points   having said that  i could see one of these bars being a decent substitute for a meal so from that standpoint  its cheap points wise all in all  the bar is pretty good   i m glad i got them and i will buy more  review  kind nuts and spices  madagascar vanilla no less ,1,0
1396,the pro plan chicken slices are great   i was trying to replace other types of dry chicken tender type treats  waggon train   which it turns out were made in china  and i found these  which i verified are made in the usa   the only part of this product that is imported are the nutrients  according to the company  but the chicken is from the us and the lamb is from new zealand   the company can t source the nutrients  vitamins  in the the quantity needed here  so they import them and test them  but the product is then manufactured here in the us the representative on the phone told me that most of their treats are made in the us  a couple are manufactured in canada  and that one treat she thought was manufactured in columbia   i asked why the label on the product just says distributed by nestle purina petcare company in st  louis  mo  and that the label doesn t say manufactured or  made in the usa   and she stated that the fda doesn t require that a label state  made in the usa   if it is made here   the fda requires that if a product is made in another country  that the name of that country be stated   i told her it would probably help the company  and consumers  if they would actually state  made in the usa  on the label at any rate  my dogs love these   i have subscribed for delivery on this product  which lowers the price a bit  and also saves me the time and money of having to go to petsmart to purchase them   that way  i always have them in the house   i go through about a bag every two weeks for my two dogs  a sheltie and a chihuahua   hope this info helps you  thanks  pro plan roasted chicken slices   great ,1,0
1397,i was told about this company by my weight loss hcg doctor  never heard of it before  by now i ve tried quite a few of their products  and this one was just ok to me  it works great  however  when poured on salad  but on chicken  fish and on its own  it doesn t taste too good  resemblance with bacon is far fetched  but i guess being on the diet of 500 calories a day everything would go just to add some taste to the food  it s ok,1,0
1398,i agree with the positive reviews  but please do not confuse the taster s choice freeze dried product  rivaling brewed coffee  with nescafe classic  horrible tasting   hard to understand how both coffee products come from same company  very strange  mystery coffee marketing,1,0
1399,sometimes i feel sorry for our dogs having to eat the same kibble every day  we can tell that they also hate having the same stuff every day  one of the worst problems for a dog owner is getting them to eat once they become disenchanted with their fare  the problem s that once we lose them  they stay lost  but with this dry food they take an interest and dinnertime becomes competitive once agin as everyone tries to glom the kibble so as to deny the other a good meal  and we d rather see that than watch them ignore their food altogether  a nice change of pace ,1,0

1402,i like this product but was dissappointed that i could not find all flavors in the plastic container with the shaker top  regardless  i use them for flavoring drinks  on fish chicken and on salads   i do not like artificial sweeteners and fake flavor enhancers   i used a packet or two or more every day  very versatile products,1,0
1403,i waited a little while to write a review on this product  i got it because i love coffee and i knew i was consuming way too much sugar from my coffee alone  the first time i tried it i was disappointed  i longed for my sugar  however i stuck with it and after a couple of days i got used to it and i now i even enjoy it for me i found that if you use too much  it leaves a horrible after taste  sort of similar to the after taste you would find in a  fake sugar  like equal or splenda   i only use one packet for a 20 oz cup of coffee overall  i m satisfied with this product and plan on repurchasing  i m off the sugar,1,0
1404,this tea is very good  but the packaging is quite deceptive  to begin with  it is not powdered matcha tea  but a leaf tea that is a blend  you can see that it is a blend if you look at the smaller print on the can  but it is a bit misleading   in addition  the tea only fills about a third and maybe even as little as a fourth of the container once you remove it from the bag inside the can  i would buy it again because it is very good tea  but don t buy it if you are looking for matcha and be aware that you re getting less than it might seem  good tea but really deceptive packaging,1,0
453,my kids  7 and 8yo s love this product and i do too for all the reasons stated below but i feel i must warn other parents about what happened this past weekend   i know that the product has a warning label that the cap is a choking hazard but i thought that for a 7 and 8yo that may not really not apply   boy was i wrong   i had to perform the heimlich on my 8yo who got the cap stuck in her throat   if it weren t the quick action of my 7yo who came running and screaming to me    things may not have turned out ok   i just want everyone to be mindful when giving these snacks to their children   even older ones  please stress to your children to only put food into their mouths   i believe that my two girls   as shaken up as they were  have learned a very valuable life lesson  cap hazard,1,0
452,the texture and taste of this syrup is much more enjoyable than most other watery  flavorless  sugarless concoctions that many manufacturers are passing off at premium prices   if you ve tasted the original mrs  butterworth s  and liked it  this is the one and only sugar free alternative that is likely to become your favorite however   the ridiculous shipping charges  that the third party amazon vendors are asking  is excuse enough to go elsewhere to make your purchase   this is now a stable and popular grocery item that is widely available for well under  5 00   your favorite  local  grocery mart probably has it  good product   but clueless vendors  shipping charges     ,1,0

1406,not a fan of herbal tea but after sipping this i might change my mind this is nice stuff  the strong peppermint taste complements the strong but not unpleasant menthol smell   i prefer caffeine in my tea but when i don t want a buzz this will serve very well i m impressed   give it a shot              later         with all that menthol  it s good if you have a cold and are congested   like drinking a cough drop  not a fan of herbal tea but    ,1,0
1407,i have tasted many different peppermint teas over the years  some of which i have really liked   but this may be the best of them all   the taste is pure peppermint  and very good peppermint at that   there is only one ingredient listed   premium peppermint leaves   and i believe it   there are no distractors from the peppermint taste taste is subjective  but if you like peppermint tea you should at least try this one  pure peppermint,1,0
1408,i started to panic when i read the comment from someone about bpa in the lid of eb glass baby jar foods  i make most of my baby food at home  but when on the road this is such an easy option  i called the company right away to get the facts  i was so relieved to hear that there are no bpa s that come into contact with the baby food  there are two layers of plastic in the lid and the layer that touches the baby food does not contain bpa  the layer in between has small traces of it  but their research has shown that it does not leech into the food  i personally feel comfortable with this and am glad i can still support this company  false statements about bpa in lids,1,0
451,this was lots of fun to make  but it was not the best tasting thing i have ever had the flavors were hard to explain  the gelatin was grainy and not smooth like gelatin should be  the textures were just weird     however  that was what i was expecting so it wasn t too bad i will buy the sushi set  just because it s so fun to make  fun to make  not to eat    ,1,0
1417,these candies are truly from arcor  the  good  ones you find in a mixed bag of hard candies   not the imitator  arcor wrappers have  arcor  written in silver on the green  leaves  on the wrapper  the red coloring on the wrapper is  orangier  than the imitation  and the  seeds  on the wrapper are more numerous and closely spaced  they have a better taste somehow  i am glad i persisted in my ordering to find the right item  the amazon page titled  arcor strawberry buds  is misleading and i received the imitation from columbia sa  not argentina  as the true arcor originates from  those were returned  what can i say  i m picky  the right ones ,1,0
1416,i purchased a box of 12 packages  the only amount offered  of miltons baking company whole wheat sesame crackers on amazon because i was desperate to find a reliable source   i love these crackers   as a whole wheat cracker  milton s are the very best   crispy  flavorful and delicious   however  when i received my crackers from the distributor not miltons  they had a mere 30 days left on the pull date   it s hard to chug a lug twelve packages in 30 days  they were already stale and oddly chipped as if mice had been nibbling along the edges  yuck  when i contacted the distributor  they refused entirely to back the product and left me hanging with a costly mistake  useless crackers  and a very bad taste in my mouth for miltons and them   frustrated  i contacted miltons baking company directly   what a pleasure   they let me know that the  mice nibbles  were from pins holding the crackers during packaging and were below their acceptable product standard  and  in a really generous gesture  they let me know immediately that  although the crackers were beyond the pull date  they would be happy to replace them under the circumstances   every aspect of my experience with the milton baking company was amazingly warm and responsive    and quick   i m looking forward to my deeeelicious crackers   they are the best   and i am very grateful for a company that really stands behind their product guarantee of full satisfaction   yes   thanks  miltons  great results with miltons and consumer alert,1,0

445,this is review is not about the quality of the hot cocoa  which i am sure is top notch  hence the 5 stars   as to not affect average rating of the product    this review  however  is on the seemingly innocent bear with the strangely flatten head that grace the cover of the box   take several steps back from your monitor  or  just zoom as far out as possible using your browser   and you will notice a whole different creature adorning the box  or you may not  the whole bear  along with the darkened cup  if viewed cursorily at a distance  transforms into the lower half of the human torso  subliminal advertising    at its finest,1,0

448,i have to get this for my son because it s the only one he likes   i tried to get him the  bare fruit  chips which are in my opinion tastier and also made in the usa but they are definitely hard to eat for a 2 year old  plus the bag doesn t have a mickey mouse on it   sigh    so  these are good and easy to eat and all is great if the severely faulty chinese quality controls don t fail yet again   it worries me that these come  from a country that has sent us deadly toys  deadly toothpaste  deadly baby formula  deadly dog food and treats  amongst many others  but hopefully he ll outgrow these ones quickly  good but from china   yikes,1,0

1409,this sauce delivers on flavor with a full bodied  almost fruity taste  it will disappoint hot sauce enthusiasts who will be expecting at least a moderate burn from a sauce with jolokia peppers  this is not a very hot sauce  falling well short of tabasco s habanero offering in terms of heat  and offering none of the punishing burn of the higher tier death sauces like mega or ultra death  or dave s  but you also don t get the bitter pepper extract taste of those hotter sauces  this sauce will delight your taste buds  but will not have you reaching for an extinguishing beverage ,1,0
446,the product is good i used it for my morning and afternoon smoothies but the date expired on the product  next time i ordered i will check the date before purchasing  date expired,1,0
1336,decided to give these a try based on price   the coffee tastes great but since the  cups  don t have the plastic bottoms  a filter element   we had to store in a sealed jar to keep them fresh and not have the coffee bean smell thru out the house    or you could use a plastic ziploc   original bag was not re sealable    they did one thing finally right   you don t have to pay more for going green when buying less packaging   kudos  great price  but change in concept    ,1,0

484,i love this conditioner pro s  you don t need a lot to cover your hair  i have medium length very thick hair   you don t need to leave it on your hair longer than a minute or two   it comes out of the bottle onto your hand very thick  not thin and runny like most conditioners at this price point   it makes your hair extremely soft in a very short amount of time   bottle rests upside down which i prefer  none wasted   hair remains soft  even after drying con s  i really cant think of any   i tried this product because of amazon vine sent one for review  but i will continue to buy it as it is about 75cents to a dollar cheaper than my old conditioner and i think it works better   it is suppossed to increase the health of your scalp  but i am not sure how i would notice that type of change   i will also say that i am allergic to many shampoos and conditioners and i have had no problem with this after 4 uses great product  great price  mimics much more expensive conditioners,1,0

1252,this is a little pricey for the quality   it can be made to work with the b150 but you need to modify the k cup holder   there are two ribs in the holder that need to be removed with a dremel or similar tool in order to use it   the first time i put the cup in it didn t fit   after removing the two ribs it works fine   makes no difference when using standard k cups after the modification   just be sure not to put a hole in the side of the holder or it won t work anymore   also would be pretty sure this would void the warranty  need to modify b150 to use,1,0

1259,i had never tried this type of product before and got it because i was curious after reading the reviews   i am not an expresso drinker and i think i was in for a bit of a shock with the taste   it had a  pop  to it  but i found it to be bitter for my tastebuds   i tried it room temperature and chilled  but neither one really appealed to me   i would not say it was distasteful by any means  and for the person who enjoys this type of drink  it most probably would be quite good   i did not experience an unpleasant aftertaste  but i did experience a lingering one   for me  a person who enjoys a mild cup of coffee with raw brown sugar and cream  no    good  but a bit strong for me ,1,0

1261,i eat this jam occasionally with peanut butter on crackers  and it is quite tasty  while it is less unhealthy than other sugary jams  i don t deceive myself that it won t raise blood sugar  because it is essentially 100  fructose  which is just as capable of raising blood sugar as sucrose  white table sugar   more on this below most people buy this product as a presumed health food due to it being lower in sugar than other jams  it s ingredients are   juice concentrate  pear  grape   strawberries  maltodextrin  dietary fiber   fruit pectin  citric acid  natural flavor   this product contains no artificial sweeteners  which are associated with various health hazards this product s primary claim to fame is that it is  as the label states   sweetened only with fruit juice   any jam will have its sweetener listed first  meaning that is its primary ingredient  if you are on a low carb diet or diabetic  you might want to know that this jam basically substitutes fructose for sucrose  since fructose is twice as sweet as sucrose  the producers only need to use half as much as they would have of sucrose  so it has about half the calories of regular jam   on the other hand  many cheap jams contain high fructose corn syrup  but that s another health issue entirely   the problem for many people is that they are used to the taste of sucrose  and 100  fructose tastes very different from a combination of fructose and sucrose which is the case with regular jam made with white sugar  to my own taste  since i m eating a fruit spread  it tastes quite sweet enough to me the fruit pectin in this product is a standard thickener in jellies and jams and its own natural form of fiber  so i am not sure why the company decided to add in  maltodextrin and call that  fiber  too  anyone with a gluten intolerance should be wary of this product because of the maltodextrin since some people with gluten intolerance are getting sick from the maltodextrin in this jam  the producers claim on the label it is  gluten free   but maltodextrin can be made from either wheat or corn  and apparently this company is not being careful enough about contamination with gluten another ingredient that is problematic as to how healthy this product can be is the  natural flavor   it is possible that the producers add a strawberry extract so they can get away with using less real strawberries  which are more expensive than a flavoring  the definition of natural flavor under the code of federal regulations is   the essential oil  oleoresin  essence or extractive  protein hydrolysate  distillate  or any product of roasting  heating or enzymolysis  which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice  fruit or fruit juice  vegetable or vegetable juice  edible yeast  herb  bark  bud  root  leaf or similar plant material  meat  seafood  poultry  eggs  dairy products  or fermentation products thereof  whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional   21cfr101 22   that essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food  but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is  delicious taste  but you pay a premium to substitute fructose for sucrose,1,0

515,product was packaged very well  2 separate flats with the k cups nestled firmly into their own spots  our previous bulk k cups were just dumped into an amazon box  they even took the time to align the print on the k cups so it was all facing the same way in the flats was a bit unpleasantly surprised by the inclusion of 8 decaf cups in the first flat  luckily only 2 in the second  wish they would have mentioned that in the description because that makes 10 of these k cups totally useless to me and my wife  and cuts down on the value of buying in bulk  the incredible variety of the pack though nulls out the useless decaf in my opinion  we have been drinking the exact same k cups for the last year so the variety is welcome  decaf surprise   1 star,1,0

1267, 1 the price is much better on del monte s canned diced tomatoes   13 26 for 12 cans  than on muir glen s canned diced tomatoes   18 70 for 12 cans     2 muir glen s canned diced tomatoes are certified organic   del monte s are not organic    3 as of june  2012  muir glen still uses cans that have a white plastic inner lining containing bisphenol a  bpa  for their canned diced tomatoes  but not for their canned tomato sauce    del monte s inner can lining is shiny  metallic brass   thus  del monte s cans are better    4 the taste of del monte s canned diced tomatoes is good but not quite as good as the taste of muir glen s canned diced tomatoes   why    a because muir glen adds tomato sauce  which is thicker  while del monte adds tomato puree  which is thinner  to their canned diced tomatoes    b because the skin of the tomato fruit and the tough part of the tomato fruit which connects to the stem is somewhat more noticeable on the del monte canned diced tomatoes than on the muir glen canned diced tomatoes    5 del monte adds high fructose corn syrup to their canned diced tomatoes  making it too high in calories   muir glen relies on the natural sugars already contained in the tomato fruit  making their canned diced tomatoes very low in calories  it s tough to choose between del monte s canned diced tomatoes and muir glen s,1,0

1269,i was so excited to get my box of fog chaser  i had been paying nearly  40 for starbucks at a wholesale club and only for 40 cups  i had cut myself to one cup per day  then my friend shared this link and i thought  why not   it arrived quickly  and smelled heavenly  i like dark  strong coffee  and i could tell by the smell it would fit the bill  the real test is in making it  i brewed it this morning  no grounds in my coffee  and no residue left in my cup  wondered if the soft filter cup at the bottom would work  and it does  how great is that     it doesn t taste like instant coffee either  which some imitations do  80 cups for  33 is an awesome deal   that is around  0 42 a cup  if you buy the little boxes at walmart you only get 18 for  10  which is around  0 61 per cup   you save  0 19 per cup  which doesn t sound like a lot  but you would spend  50 buying as much at walmart to get 80 k cups  so you are saving  17  i love it    order yours today  you won t be disappointed  keurig who    ,1,0
1270,please note that each box has 5 bars in it  not six or 7   and each bar is 1 6 ounces  i am vert happy with these   there is only one criticism    the taste is dry and bland   however i eat many things not because they taste good  but because they are healthy   the nutrition listing does not break down the fiber content by soluble and insoluble fiber  however i see that they do contain psyllium which includesa lot of soluable fiber  which is good   you need both soluble and insoluble fiber in your diet   there is only one other fiber bar or cereal bar that i know of that has 12 grams of fiber    gnu food bars   gnu bars are tastier  but are also much more expensive    over  1 45 each bar   these are a little over half that price   i will try these for awhile to see how they work out compared to gnu foods bars   should be the same   i know i like gnu foods   please note  only 5 bars in each box  not 6 or seven unless amazon made a special arrangement with the manufacture   even the picture above of the box says 5 bars  not a lot of taste  but great for your health   and less expensive ,1,0
514,i discovered this tea on a trip to pike s market  i almost did not buy it because it indicated it had orange flavoring which i am not usually fond of  i noticed they had samples sitting out so i tried it  i did not really notice the orange flavor   mostly cinnamon and other similar flavors  there is no sugar or artifical sweetners in this which makes it even better  my favorite tea,1,0
1271,my two boxes absolutely love these freeze dried liver treats  it is one of their favorites   both dogs do their kidney bean dances in the kitchen when we take the lid off   the only bad thing is the treats are small and they only recommend a few daily    but  i guess that s not too much of a bad thing given these are a little pricer than the average dog treat  dogs love these ,1,0
513,i ordered this for review  provided by company  and thought it s conditioner  it s not a miracle it s not a miracle product  but it out performed my regular conditioner and i would say it worked as well as the product i bought at the saloon it smells nice  not overwhelming my hair isn t heavy or greasy i ll purchase more when i run out of it  better than expected,1,0
1273,while  we wouldn t have blind tasted picked out the idea of mozzarella for these  the flavor is still cheesy and good  everyone in my family enjoyed these  a light flavor that left us all fighting over the to the last bite  definitely going on the grocery list  cheesy,1,0
1274,years ago when we were moving out of our home town in nd  we stayed in a motel that last night  as all of the furniture had been put in moving vans   it was late at night and i went to the hotel office where they had a vending machine and i purchased an oh henry bar   i ll never forget that   gotta order some now  memories,1,0

523,now i understand what was holding my sauce back from being true  gravy   it was my good but not great tomatoes  now i have to see if i can lower the cost at all in my local market  cause i feel the need  the need for       believe the hype,1,0
524,these cookies are from tate s bakery in southampton  rebranded for trader joe s  i guess that s why they call them  highbrow   because they are from southampton  you can buy a tate s cookbook and it has a recipe for them  these are tate s cookies,1,0
1246,i usually just get packets of cocoa  brew hot water with the keurig and mix  em in  but this deal was too good to pass up  overall  the flavor is great  i was a little disappointed with the  peppermint  flavor  it tasted  for lack of a better word   chemical ly   the mint was a little strange  but i still drank them all so they obviously weren t too bad  very tasty cocoa ,1,0
1217,not bitter but strong  best decaf ever by far  can t compare to lavazza  which i think is overrated and terrible  4 stars because of the high cost even though is cheaper here at amazon that in my area   the bay area in california  can t even find it here  best tasting decaf  the best decaf coffee by far,1,0
532,i was very excited to receive this as a gift from my husband and i absolutely was not disappointed  it was very easy to put together and everything i planted came to sprout even before the projected days  i ve been making pesto out the wazoo  after i cleaned it the first time however i could not figure out why the pump wasn t working or find an explanation in the manual  a simple call to the manufacturer cleared it right up  they where very kind and helpful  the only thing i have noticed is the plants that i have transplanted have not continued to flourish as nicely outside in the dirt  but i cant really fault them for that because that s not what it was made for  there also might be some operator error involved but i haven t been curious enough to look into it yet    love my year round garden,1,0
1218,i was going to list every item they sent but vine voice reviewer  mrs  r  henderson  has kindly done that   the only difference i think is that i seemed to get a few more small items tucked in here and there   just extra single cello wrapped chocolate dipped oreos and pretzels   everything else was virtually the same   the godiva box of chocolates was one that if you bought in the store  you d pay at least  25 to  30 for depending upon the type of box you chose   mine came in a huge and sturdy olive colored wood and raffia woven basket that in and of itself was a gift   the basket had wooden handles that were cut  to a pattern and the raffia was woven through the wooden frame   this was all topped off with an elaboprate burgundy ribbon that again would be suitable for re use on a sunday hat or another gift i wanted to upload some photos of the items all dissassembled and show as they are but the moment i ordered it  the item became unavailable and i am guessing this is due to the hot weather   when the item becomes available again  i will include my photos so you can see that wine gift baskets has been paying close attention to the complaints about the quality and number of items in their baskets by increasing both to created added value   i feel this was an appropriately priced gift that anyone would be glad to receive provided they don t live in a hot temperature climate that would melt the choclates  candy and cheese i will update this review when the item becomes available once more  much better than the photo shows   huge amount of food in giant basket,1,0
1219,nothing is seriously wrong with these farmed oysters from the people s republic of china   there are no inclusions of sand or shell fragments   just as clams are an extremely  extremely rich source of iron  oysters are an extremely  extremely rich source of zinc   the only problem might be that these oysters don t taste quite as good as the best tasting brands of canned whole oysters   like most farmed oysters from china  these oysters are dark gray in color  which might be considered a disadvantage by someone who has become comfortable eating light colored  good tasting  canned farmed oysters from south korea   unlike smoked oysters  which are high in cancer causing nitrosamines and cancer causing heterocyclic amines  these oysters are quite good for your health   oysters are extremely low in mercury and other marine pollutants and moderately high in the long chain omega 3 fatty acids  epa and dha  no inclusions of sand or shell fragments,1,0
1221,a while back  i ordered 3 bottles of the torani syrup i think it was the caramel  and i really like the flavor  but it is like water  so be prepared when you start using it  the only other thing i would like would be to be able to choose 3  different  flavors instead of all 3 flavors being the same  torani syrup,1,0
1222,have used this regularly for a few months now  like that it is wafer and not too heavy  also not too sweet  will cont t order through amazon love this protein bar,1,0
1223,i love them  not too sweet but just right  any allergy free food is great in my book  hope non of these ingredients contains corn   thats a no no for me too  however i dont appreciate the fact that i opened my new box and the cut 1 4 of it off  if the size it less then so should the charge  this will effect my decision in buying again  i am not a toddler i need a real size bar please great taste but size it smaller,1,0
1224,these bars are great  this was my second order and the second box seems to be more stale   the first box contained bars that were so fresh and soft and this second box contains bars that are not as white  soft or fresh   they have a later expiration date but the products are not as fresh  second order not so great,1,0
530,i love nature s path  however with this cereal i am not disappointed  but i am not impressed either first off  if you take a look at the pictures  you see will see a good mix of corn  rice  flax  quinoa  buckwheat   amaranth  however  it appears that when nature s path change the look on their boxes  they also change their formula  mines was about 70  cornmeal  30  everything else  i have uploaded a photo so hopefully you can see what i saw  should be one of the very last photos in the gallery  because mines was 70  cornmeal  the cereal did taste like vanilla but it had a cornmeal aftertaste  if you take a long time with your cereal  slowly the vanilla transfers onto the milk  and the cereal mostly take like cornmeal now if you like the taste of corn  that s fine  but i was expecting more flavors particularly the flax and amaranth  but those flavors were lost in the mix this product is however 100  organic except for natural vanilla flavor  sea salt  and tocopherols  natural vitamin e   compare to other cereals  it is low in calories  110   contains no cholesterol  and is high in fiber  12  of your daily values   however  because it is organic with very little added to it  it is low in nutrition compare to other non organic cereals such as special k  it only has 4  iron  surprisingly  vitamin e is not listed as a nutrition even though it is listed as an ingredient  other pros of the cereal is that it contains 0 15g of omega 3 per serving  which is 11  of the recommended daily value of 1 3git is also gluten free for those who can t consume gluten as well as certified usda organic  my cereal box expired nov 02 2012 the box says that nature s path change their boxes by making their packages smaller to reduce 10  of their impact on the planet by saving on water  energy and paperboard  however  i am also 100  convinced that their also change their formula to include more of the cheaper cornmeal and include less of the more expensive ingredients  changed their formula  taste like vanilla   cornmeal,1,0
1226,the first one i tried i thought the product was  taste free   the second one i thought  this isn t too bad   now  i can t leave it alone  only concern is if i can buy it at a decent price  love it  if at first    ,1,0
1227,i ordered kellogs bran flakes on subscribe   save as the price in the supermarket was exhorbitant   price on subscribe   save wasn t ideal either  but was still sufficiently less than the price in the supermarket to warrant a subscription order   each order was for six 500g boxes of bran flakes   i was disappointed with the amount of packaging  as within the amazon box  each pair of bran flake boxes was wrapped in shrink wrap   however  the product itself was perfect   i m disappointed that it is now no longer available on subscribe   save  regular  shipments of bran flakes,1,0
1228,this product leaves hair smelling clean and scalp feeling fresh  does not dry out or damage as bad as other anti dandruff products  good product,1,0
1229,let me set the stage    i have a fairly big yard with some fairly big trees  and a dog that likes to hunt rabbits and leave a big mess for us to clean up in the yard   we ve tried numerous options for keeping the rabbits out of the yard  but nothing seems to work   the critter ridder is the first  chemical  option we ve tried because we re usually worried about the safety of the dog  but this product is made in the usa  and contains nothing more than natural spices  so we figured it was safe for our dog   we spread the whole jar around the perimeter of the yard   we noticed that rabbits would no longer enter the yard  but the ones that were already in the yard would also not leave   so  yes  it does what it claims   unfortunately  it rained two days later  and the effect was then gone   of cours this isn t the fault of the product  but it s simply too expensive for us to sprinkle a whole container around the perimeter of the yard every couple days   we will continue to look for solutions to keep the rabbits out of our yard   this product is probably better suited for sprinkling over small gardens to keep the rabbits out  as you can make a whole container last for months when you only have to sprinkle such a small area   for large yards  this is too expensive of an option   i ll update the review if i ever find a perfect solution for my yard    i rated this product 4 stars because it does work as advertised  but had to dock it a star because of the fact that it s not the  perfect  solution for my yard  works well  but takes a lot ,1,0
1230,product was shipped on time and was not stale or expired at all  all red starbursts is a great idea  awesome,1,0
1231,i like this conditioner and i ve very picky about what hair products i use  it leaves my hair soft  silky  and most importantly tangle free  my hair knots up if you just look at it the wrong way and i ve definitely spent less time combing my hair out after switching to this conditioner once rinsed out it does leave your hair smelling good  although i did notice that it had a slightly chemical smell to it when in the bottle  however it dissipates quickly the bottle doesn t say that it s safe for colour treated hair  however i have highlighted hair and have been using this product for several weeks with no ill effects on my coloured hair  your mileage may vary of course  leaves my hair soft  silky  and tangle free   ,1,0
528,i found it as a sweet treat and with 7 grams of sugar it is no wonder  this cereal list a long list of ingredients that include whole corn meal  evaporated cane juice and  molasses  the box only seems to highlight two main points  that the cereal is gluten free and organic  but there is also an appropriate warning that it is produced in a facility that uses peanuts  tree nuts and soy  i only added milk to the contents of the box and enjoyed the vanilla flavor and did not notice an aftertaste  i liked that it stays crunchy while in milk  this is not a cereal i would eat every day but as a treat  i would eat this again but i would not seek it out  a crunchy vanilla treat,1,0
527,okay so the disappointing thing about these things are is that they are super small pieces of brownie   i believe there s roughly 10 in each little package   who can eat 10 tiny little pieces and be done   i don t know about you but 100 calories may be great but i end up eating like 3 packages at a time   i suppose the only good thing is that i m underweight by about 15 lbs or so which means it won t kill me but still it seems a bit senseless  it s food ,1,0
1245,this is very cocoa flavored but still tastes good  i prefer their regular choc chip  but that s a preference  these cookies are only 60 calories each  nice big size  sweet enough  and crunchy for sure  be warned that the cookies break easily apparently and your box may contain crumbles and not a whole cookie  i bought mine in a retail chain store and had that issue so shipping may be the culprit  ill buy on amazon in bulk because i enjoyed them a lot  but ill have to tell the shipper to pack extra careful good but not great,1,0
525,i love the item but one egg cup was cracked when i opened the box   it was packed well so i m sure it s a fluke  i would still use this seller again   i just wanted a replacement though   however  when i went to the return area  replacement was not an option   i hope the seller will replace this for me   i don t want to go to the trouble and expense of sending it back   the egg set is adorable and i m excited to use three of them   i obviously wish i could use all four since that is what i have paid for   accidents happen and i know this isn t the sellers fault   the egg set and spoons are exactly what i wanted and are very adorable   love them  i love the item,1,0
1244,this is one of the better decaf brews i have found for the keurig   i found others to be bland and leave somewhat of an aftertaste   one i tried  san francisco  had very poor packaging with cloth bottom so the coffee would go stale i highly recommend this  i ll sure order it again   decaf    really  ,1,0
1243,this is just what i was looking for   being new to the keurig i wanted to try different flavors without being stuck with a bunch left over that i didn t like   it s a little expensive  over a  1 a k cup once you add shipping  but worth it my only problem with this seller is they didn t send me one of the flavors i wanted and sent me ones that i didn t ask for in replace   i have contacted them twice already about it  they send they will send the right ones out but that never happened  because they are a little more expensive it makes me a little upset i am stuck with 3 kcups of a flavor i didn t ask for  and probably won t ever drink  instead of the flavor i really wanted   otherwise a nice seller to work with and really fast shipping  good idea ,1,0
1242,duke and chunk love this food   i had been feeding them beneful for a couple of years  but once i discovered the quality of the ingredients  or lack thereof   i decided that my furbabies deserved more than that   beneful is horrible for dogs  and made my lab constipated all the time   since the switch to natural balance  i realized how much they disliked the old food  because they actually get excited when i fill up the food dish and they look happier when they eat   i now realize that they only ate the beneful because that s all they had   imagine eating something you thought was gross for years on end   i felt so bad   i ll never switch back   this food actually fills them up faster  so i actually spend about the same amount of money as i did on beneful   the better quality ingredients fill them up faster   i am converted for life   it s extra money  but it s so worth it to know that my dogs are healthy  happy  and full   plus  duke poops like a champ now  my dogs have never begged for their food before ,1,0
526,i have an 8 month old shepherd puppy  and he absolutely loves this food  i had been feeding him iams previously  which his stomach could not tolerate it  every other day he would have diarrhea    poor baby   then switched him to acana  which was an improvement but still not the best it could be  so i bought him this food hopeful that the prebiotics would help with his digestion  since switching him  he has not had a single bathroom issue  this food is 100  worth the money  my pup is happy and so much healthier  and his coat shows it  too    the best dog food,1,0
1275,i have used ths conditioner for a little while  this bottle was the first i recieved from amazon but not the first i used  i m very happy with it  it has a pleasant but not overpowering scent  goes on and through the air smoothly with none of the unpleasant thick clingy consistency i have experienced with some other products  it also rinses out easily and completely which is very important for a conditioner  my hair when dry doesn t look weighed down at all  it was shipped tightly wrapped in plastic and while there was a little leakage into the wrap it was completely contained and easily rinsed off from the bottle so it didn t concern me  great conditioner ,1,0
1241,my dogs liked the previous flavors  chicken  etc   so i was enthused to try this new flavor   my dogs seemed to liked this even better than the chicken   not sure what more to say about it since i am only able to see a visual response   appears to be a good  premium  slightly expensive dry dog food  my dogs favor the sirloin over the chicken,1,0
1239,this isn t your typical ginger ale  it s not too fizzy and this really has a very real ginger taste to it that will tingle the back of your palate  with the way the drink will settle in the bottle  you can see how the ginger separates   a gentle shake and it returns to a cloudy liquid   there aren t any big chunks in it  delicious,1,0
1237,the height of the dried shiitake mushrooms inside of the jar was substantially lower than the height of the dried shiitake mushrooms pictured in the photo   this means either that    1 i did not receive 12oz of dried shiitake mushrooms as i should have  or  2 i did receive 12oz of dried shiitake mushrooms but the photo is fraudulent in depicting a height of dried shiitake mushrooms that is substantially higher than amazon com customers will actually receive   the printed label on the outside of the jar has also changed  becoming a little less attractive than what is pictured in the photo   the dried shiitake mushrooms inside of the jar are adequately good   they are smaller in diameter than the dried shiitake mushrooms in most other brands   i strongly urge roland to install a tamper evident seal on the top of the jar for this product   this would help to prevent people from conveniently  taking a sample  of dried shiitake mushrooms  leaving less mushrooms for the paying customer   i only received enough dried shiitake mushrooms to reach the 55  level in the height of roland s jar   roland s photo of this product shows the dried shiitake mushrooms reaching the 85  level in the height of the jar  the photo overstates the mushroom level that i actually received,1,0
1236,some of the amazon tagges for this product are incorrect   i was looking for cat food  and unilt i zoomed in on the front lable to see that it was a dog   i have seen iams cat food listed as dog food and dog food listed as cat food   double check the pictures on the lables before ordering  or you might end up with a unhappy pet  zoom on the picutre to make sure it is a cat or dog,1,0
1235,this is one of the only  treats  that last longer than 5 minutes with our golden retriever   they smell horrible but he likes them  and that s what matters  stinky  but my dog loves them ,1,0
1234,the product itself is a decent quality chocolate covered coffee bean   i don t mean  decent  to be derogatory more so than i mean it to convey a sense of  what do you expect at such a good price  i did not buy these for a community jar  or what have you  i bought these for my own personal consumption and they fit the bill perfectly   they are a great snack in the morning on the way to school  or when i m up bright and early to go fishing  or when i m merely sitting on the computer reading the morning news  gotta love technology  i do have to disagree with the  cigarette smoke  aftertaste  i did not get that at all again  if you have specific tastes for your coffee beans  you probably ought to skip these   however  if you want bulk and consider  a coffee bean a coffee bean  then you will not be disappointed oh  one last thing  if you ship any sort of chocolate in the summer months  it has the distinct possibility of melting  no matter the lengths the distributor goes to prevent it   these distributors gave fair warning about this and gave me the opportunity to cancel   i took a chance and  although my item did in fact melt  it was not that bad and i consider this a good buy  not bad ,1,0
1233,i have been drinking the starbucks coffee s for years  the little double shot espresso can  similar to this one i like this one much more  there is no aftertaste  i really like it  i will get this product instead of the starbucks if i need to choose between those two this product taste much better tastier than the starbucks doubleshot,1,0
1240,there are a lot of these products on the market lately   not just energy drinks in general but this kind that you add to water like mio   this tastes really good and gives you energy   you get a really big bottle of it too  fruit and energy to boot ,1,0
428,i had been wanting to try this cereal because i usually have hot cereal for breakfast and thought this might be a nice alternative the taste is good  it has a hint of cinnamon and is crunchy  i do use a lot of milk but the cereal remained crunchy  on the bottom where the milk was  it tastes sweet and when you look at the ingredients serving size you realize that it contains about 2 teaspoons of sugar  not too bad but if you are trying to go for a low caloric cereal  this is not the one i liked it and would recommend others to try it  just a hint of cinnamon,1,0
1276,the tea taste ok only hot     drink it cold and you will gag   arrived when it was suppose to  satisfied with purchase it s ok,1,0
1278,i ordered these snacks but ended up receiving a multipack of small bite sized biscuits  i am guessing the ingredients are the same  so i did not bother sending them back  the product i did receive   hello panda strawberry creme bite sized snacks   are delicious  same company  same overall product  but different size and shape  that said i think these are likely just as good  what i ordered  but not what i got,1,0
494,it s incredible  as in not credible believable  as in  i honestly can t accept that something this tasty has no calories or just  trace  calories  to me there s no off taste or aftertaste  it smells   tastes just like what i d expect from regular chocolate syrup   no  i haven t tried them side by side but at this point i don t even care to   my theory  it contains microscopic computers that act on your taste buds to fool them into a state of delight    and that would partly explain the high cost  yes  i m being ridiculous  but no more ridiculous than the notion that there s no calories in this the real problem with this product is  what will you use it on  unless these folks also make a zero calorie ice cream  you re bound to choose something that at least partly cancels the advantage  ok maybe strawberries or bananas would be all right  face it  nobody s gonna pour this stuff on celery    that is all  five adoring stars  incredible,1,0
1309,i have tried both this and hawaii roasters brand  they are both very good coffees  this brand  farm direct  is priced about  4 below the hawaii roasters first  hawaii roasters came in a vacuum packaging  the packaging of this brand was not as airtight i tasted the difference especially on the first time i opened the packages hawaii roasters tastes better and is somewhat more potent but this brand is still a fine coffee  and it tastes very close to a very fine french coffee  there isn t much flavor here but it provides a fine surge of coffeine rush the hawaii roasters cost almost 20  more  and it might be almost 20  better  but if you want a quality kona coffee  then this brand will probably meet your needs i still recommend this coffee but it isn t quite the best kona coffee i ve tasted  almost as good as hawaii roasters,1,0

493,this is not nearly as concentrated as the mio water flavors that you also squirt into your glass or bottle of water   but  you get a lot more of it  12 oz  and one 1 2 fluid oz  squirt has 120  daily requirement for vitamin c and no calories   the fruit punch tastes good  however i like my water to be very weakly flavored so i probably put in about a 1 2 squirt giving me 60  of my daily requirement for vitamin c it s mainly advertised as being a source of vitamin c  but there are more things beside vitamin c in it vitamin c   120 vitamin b6   40 vitamin b5   40 vitamin b3   40 vitamin b12   40 zinc   10 chromium   10 the plastic bottle is a good shape for your hand to grab it easily and squeeze   this might be a good way to get some needed vitamin c without having to eat a lot of citrus or swallowing vitamin c pills   and  if you like your water flavored but are particular like me  about how much flavor is in it  then this is a good way to control it  tastes good,1,0
1311,pure  unpasteurized  unfiltered  organic  kosher  raw honeylove it  love it  love it i rarely recommend buying something that s more expensive than any  regular  type  but organic is well worth it as far as i m concerned  any time you can afford organic i believe it s worth the extra money because it s all about your health  not just taste  everything you eat affects your health  you either pay extra now for the good stuff  or you pay a lot more later in the way of doctor bills and possibly even an early death i get raw  unheated  never heat treated  honey from a friend now and then  she has her own hives  and y s  organic honey is just as good if not better  don t tell her  but i think this may be better than hers because her raw honey is not certified organic and kosher  who knows where her bees have been    i know honey can taste different depending on what flowers the bees pollinate  and i m not sure what kind of honey this is  what kind of flowers  but the flavor is just right  not too mild  not too strong  not too sweet  i know i sound like goldie locks  but it s just right with honey bees rapidly disappearing from the world  scientists don t know why  i like the idea of organic hives   making sure chemicals are not spread around that may harm the bees as well as the people who eat their honey one word of caution though  when you shop for this honey  if you don t read the label carefully you might buy one that is not organic  y s  bee farms makes both organic and not organic  and they are both raw and unpasteurized  i uploaded photos to show you the two different bottles  see above   organic is in glass jars  and more expensive  non organic is in plastic jars and a little less money  but if you don t look closely you may think the non organic is organic because the name of the company is  y s  organic bee farms   and that name is on all jars  organic or not  to make sure your honey  or any food item  is truly organic  make sure it has the certified organic seal  as this product does      what you should know about raw honey vs  pasteurized honey raw honey is the concentrated nectar of flowers gathered by bees  naturally  that s what they do  that comes straight from the bee hive  through an extracting process in a controlled setting   raw honey is unheated  pure  unpasteurized  and unprocessed  raw honey is the healthiest choice amongst the various forms of honey as it has the most nutritional value and contains amylase  an enzyme concentrated in flower pollen which helps predigest starchy foods like breads  raw honey often has a thick yellow look to it  almost like yellow wax  when at cooler room temperatures  if the room is warmer it may turn a more golden color and look like a very thick syrup honey is an alkaline forming food  which means raw honey contains ingredients similar to those found in fruits  which become alkaline in the digestive system  it doesn t ferment in the stomach and it can be used to counteract acid indigestion  when mixed with ginger and lemon juices  it also relieves nausea and supplies energy most of the honey found in the supermarket is not raw  you can usually tell the difference by looking at it  when it s not raw it usually looks like a thick amber liquid you can almost see through  like a light colored thin syrup  this is because it has been processed and pasteurized  heated at 70 degrees celsius or more  followed by rapid cooling  and filtered so that it looks cleaner and smoother  more appealing on the shelf  and easier to handle and package because it s not as thick as raw honey pasteurization kills any yeast cell in the honey and prevents fermentation  it also slows down the speed of crystallization in liquid honey and that s why it looks  cleaner  and smoother  but  when honey is heated and pasteurized its delicate aromas  yeast and enzymes  that are responsible for activating vitamins and minerals in the body system  are partially destroyed  for this reason raw honey is assumed to be more nutritious than honey that has undergone heat treatment caution   bee products may cause allergic reactions in some people  honey is not recommended for children under two  better than having your own bee hive ,1,0
1313,this product has a good taste and seems to be of good quality  much better quality than store brands like giant eagle  whose green tea tastes awful and their tea bags rip open quite easily    i would buy this again  as the price i paid for this tea was less than i would have found elsewhere  good quality for a good price,1,0
492,i love this product  i ended up going with it after having it be recommended by friends and family  read some reviews online and i went ahead with the purchase the product is great  the litter box is very simple to clean and doesn t smell  if it does smell  you re feeding your cat the wrong food  try something else and you ll be shocked  doesn t smell,1,0

1308,i really liked this flavor because it seems to be pretty healthy for a pre made baby food  but i do wish the packs were bigger and they used less pears so it s not so sugary  also  i contacted them once and asked what countries did all their ingredients come from and they never answered    don t know why  probably china    it s better than most ,1,0
489,these are the gourmet of  regular  jelly beans  they are not too big  but not small either  they are made with real fruit flavoring but don t have liquid filled centers  and the batches i ve received have been fresh  viz   soft but not mushy  clearly a 5 star jelly bean at a 5 star price  my favorite,1,0
1323,fructose is fructose  it s a simple sugar found in plants  both fruits and vegetables  buying fructose is like buying salt  brand names don t matter much  i m sure there are conspiracy theories about fructose  but as an old woman i m tired of hearing  the sky is falling  the sky is falling    first it s  don t eat butter   then it s  butter is good for you   etc  etc getting away from health issues  i have to say that if you want to buy fructose  this amazon item is a bargain   you get a lot of fructose for the money  i think it s less expensive  pound for pound  that the fructose i get from publix  a bargain ,1,0

1327,the bottle is very large and you ll get a lot out of it   intensity of flavor is to  taste    i think that s why they measure by  a squeeze  rather than anything more scientific  also  for convenience    by the end of the bottle  i was able to quickly figure out how much of a squeeze i wanted to get it to taste the way i wanted that said  the flavor does taste very  chemical  like  i m not sure if they want me to feel like i am getting vitamins or if they were going more for a  sports drink  type of flavor   my husband  who is a fitness nut  didn t mind the flavor at all   me  i found it very off putting and far too fake   i would have preferred more of a crystal light than a powerade flavor the bottle is very convenient   makes it easy to fill up a normal water bottle  add my squeeze  and then off i go on the bike or trip  i just wish i liked the taste better  ok  kind of  chemical  tasting,1,0
1328,yummmy       i love how these are vegan and have no gelatin  just to clarify for everyone   the reason why other fruit snacks are so cheap is because they use almost zero fruit and they use gelatin  gelatin is made of the ground up parts of animals  usually cow and pig  soooo gelatin is never vegetarian and usually not kosher  even if it is kosher  it is still made from ground up parts of cow  and is therefore not vegetarian  so bottom line   annies is worth every  single  cent  because it is free of gross dead things  why these are awesome,1,0

1330,i ordered this on a subscription basis from amazon    they send me a couple of boxes every two months  i originally purchased it because i m trying to get away from the sucralose  etc  chemical products  this fits the bill  more natural than the alternatives i have a nagging question on price though  this product comes in a smaller package than splenda and the rest of the sugar substitutes  plus  it s a more powdery formulation so i have to use more packets than i do when using the other sugar substitutes since i m an avid price comparer these two facts make sweetleaf s price difficult to compare  i have a feeling i m paying a lot more than i should be for it  so i m cancelling my subscription and purchasing liquid stevia at whole foods if price doesn t matter  there is certainly nothing wrong with this product  good stuff,1,0

1332,someone grabbing a bag of veggie straws may mistakenly believe veggie straws are made primarily of vegetables other than potatoes   in fact  a quick read of the back of the bag reveals they are made primarily of potatoes and flavored with tomato and spinach   this explains why they taste so much like potato chips   the texture is light and crisp  and while it s been many years since i ve had pork rinds  that s what i think of when i bite into these straws sensible portions is the name of the company   a 20 ounce bag contains 20 servings  which is about 38 straws   each serving has 7 grams of fat   compare that to frito lay baked  ruffles original potato crisps  which contains only 3 grams of fat per 1 ounce serving if you can overlook the fat content  veggie straws are actually quite tasty  and they do have that psychological edge with that name   i feel like i m eating healthier  even when i m not  good flavor  a little misleading,1,0

496,generally  i don t like flavored tea  and the experiences i ve had with chocolate flavored tea left me convinced it really couldn t be done in any palatable way  i was wrong  i don t know what led me to try stash s chocolate mint oolong but this tea is outstanding  it does not taste like palmer s chocolate coins dissolved and diluted in too much water  which is what most chocolate tea tastes like to me    not even a hershey s kiss  but palmer s    yuck  this tea has a very light yet distinct chocolaty flavor followed by sweet mint  it s refreshing in the evening after dinner when i want something sweet but don t want to load up on sugar right before bedtime  and  truth be told  it s a delight any time of day  best chocolate tea i ve had,1,0

1280,when i was younger  i was prone to trying whatever new product came along  eschewing the various benefits that i was seeking  seldom  if ever  was there a payoff  when i see an advertisement for a product promising  bigger    better   or  stronger   i don t even consider it  imagine my surprise when i tried this new shampoo and actually noticed more volume in my hair after blow drying it  even weirder  two people asked me if i d had my hair cut the day i used it  seriously  it s not a miraculous change  it s a shampoo  not a weave  but it definitely makes a noticeable difference  the only negative comment i have  is that it has a fairly strong perfume scent  which i tend to avoid in soaps and shampoos  but i will absolutely continue to use it  unbelievable  literally ,1,0

1286,i bought this at my local store  not off amazon  it was about  5 a box  i think    i wanted the king arthur flour vanilla cake mix  but the store only had the kaf chocolate mix   i came home and looked up reviews of the mix and found it here on amazon   i wasn t encouraged by them  but went ahead and made it anyway   it was for my friend s birthday and her celebration was only a few hours away   i think that the company must have changed the ingredients that go into this cake  the reviews are all from 2011 at the most recent  this is easy to put together  as all mixes are  the only change i made was to add some fiori de sicilia to it for flavoring   after the cake came out   it release from the pan very easily   i brushed it with lemon curd and topped it with sliced strawberries   the cake was pretty good  i thought   not dry  with a tender crumb   i thought there was a slight hint of grainy texture  but the lemon curd went a long way towards softening the cake   i will say that it s a little bland   it didn t much taste of vanilla to me   and so i think that if i made this again  i would add even more flavoring   an almond extract might be nice  or rum  or just a lot of vanilla   think 2tsp    this wouldn t be my go to cake  i would always prefer one made from scratch   but this is pretty good  and doesn t taste at all of chemicals like regular non gluten free cake mixes do  improved texture ,1,0

505,i ordered this product because my hair is extremely damaged from hair coloring  and have been looking for a shampoo for color treated hair that didn t have a conditioner in it  my hair is extremely fine and thin  and conditioner weighs it down horribly  i also assumed that a new shampoo for color treated hair would be sulfate free  since sulfates are supposed to strip color from treated hair  the name  clear  carries connotations of purity to my mind sadly  the shampoo is not sulfate free  it s the second item on the list  so while it might be making my hair feel and look better temporarily  it s not going to help the color stay in  which means more color damage as i have to frequently recolor    also  the shampoo contains silicons  now  silicons are much  much better for thin hair than oils are  but it s still a conditioner that can weigh thin  fine hair down i ve been using the shampoo daily for just over a week now  i can say that my hair is shinier after washing and drying  and a little easier to comb tangles out of  but the silicon does weigh my hair down a bit   not nearly as much as other shampoos for color treated hair do    and i ve noticed it collecting dust  i use a white comb  so i can readily see if there is dirt in my hair at the end of the day  of course  i work in a very dusty dirty atmosphere a lot of days  so ymmv my decision in the end  this is a decent shampoo  and will probably use it a couple of times a week  but i want something without any conditioner silicon for the rest of the time  someone who has thicker hair will probably love this shampoo  i had my husband try it  his hair isn t damaged  or as limp as mine  and he thought it was really nice just one thing  i was a little confused when something named  clear  came out of the bottle as a creamy  opaque liquid  i rechecked the bottle to make sure i hadn t accidentally gotten conditioner  good  but not great,1,0

1301,the manufacturer says that it has been transitioning out of bpa cans and completed that process with the fall 2011 harvest  i don t know what the shelf life is for canned tomatoes  so i don t know whether what s being sold in june 2012 might have been packaged pre september 2011  but at least you have a shot at a non bpa can with these tomatoes oh  and they also taste good  very adaptable  since they aren t strongly seasoned but the fire roasting brings out even more tomato flavor  manufacturer says no longer using bpa,1,0
1277,i have been having a hard time finding preserves in our markets   i liked this variety of flavors   i have been buying different brands and have not been disappointed   i will definitely be buying from maury island farms again   blueberry is my favorite  great change,1,0
500,we were pretty excited to try this out especially for use with workouts etc  water doesn t always cut it and gatorade etc gets a bit costly plus all the sugar and salt really adds up over time first  the squeeze idea is great  no mess  no fuss  super simple to use  vast improvement over powdered drinks  including gatorade with the added benefit of being able to adjust for personal preference i found a quick squeeze more than ample  my other half liked a bit more flavor  we both liked the ability to squeeze and go  so far so good  will give the convenience a big plus the so so part is the flavor   i m just not wild about the fruit punch flavor but would probably be willing to give other flavors a try and see if they are more to my liking  it s not bad per se  it s just not that good  at first i thought it was just me but spouse felt the same way  will consider this more or less neutral since it s not great but certainly not bad either now for the thing that i don t really like   the vitamins  yes  there is a nice range of vitamins and at first glance  that sounds fine but  the quality of the included vitamins is questionable  for example  for b12  cyanocobalmin is used rather than the more expensive  and bioavailable  methylcobalmin  to be perfectly fair  the vast majority of people probably won t don t care and the idea of taking in some vitamins at all is an improvement  however  those that are health conscious and or only use bioavailable forms of vitamins will be disappointed  i try not to take inferior vitamin types so that they don t block absorption of better more available forms all in all  a vast improvement over cola s  very convenient  not bad tasting but not great and selection of vitamins could be better  convenient   good idea   adequate quality taste,1,0
501,i ordered this for review  provided by company  and thought it s shampoo  it s not a miracle it s not a miracle product but it out performed my regular shampoo and i would say it worked as well as the product i bought at the saloon it smells nice  not overwhelming it suds well in hard water my hair isn t heavy or greasy i ll purchase more when i run out of it  surprised,1,0
1297,best substitute i ve tasted to date   all sugar substitutes seem to have some after taste for me splenda is the worst   but this one the least of all   also seems to be equivalent to real sugar for measuring   now all we need is a truvia brown sugar substitute  delicious ,1,0
502,i used to buy this mexican version at my local wal mart until they quit selling it   the mexican version tastes better that the american version  this one actually tastes like chocolate milk   it is richer  and you can taste the chocolate in it  to me it tastes like the american version before they changed the formula to the new  less sugar  formula  which is strange because now the american version tastes way too sweet and it doesn t even taste like chocolate  it taste like plain ole nothing except maybe milk that is too sweet to drink  if you like  chocolate  milk  buy this version   its the only one my family will drink  tastes better that american version,1,0
1295,with the powder formula  we have to mix it with filtered water which we thought was inconvenient at night  which is why i bought this   however it turns out the opened bottle has to be refrigerated  we don t want to feed our baby with very cold formula  so we end up having to warm it up    net net it s probably more trouble   and it s more expensive than the powder version   so  either buy the powder version  or buy the ready to feed formula in 2 oz bottles    this version doesn t make a lot of sense   i wanted to return it but decided to bite the bullet    not very fun  didn t really save me the trouble though,1,0
1294,fuze has created a tasty  low calorie drink  originally purchased the slenderize accidently for my 14 yr old son who tried it and decided he didn t like it  and being the frugal mom  i wasn t going to let it go to waste  i was delighted to find it was delicious  i didn t look at the vitamin count or the calorie count until after my first sip  second or even the third  i looked here on amazon hoping for an amazing deal  but was disappointed  it is too bad that the shipping here on amazon is so high  but a 15 lb box isn t cheap to send  i m sure  very tasty low calorie drink,1,0
504,i bought this at home depot as part of a 3 pack that included a fogger and personal spray  i have fountains  a pool  large pond  grass  and an orange tree so insects love my place  i have two large windows and a sliding glass door that are covered in insects all day during the heat  i used this spray 8 hours ago and there s not 1 bug on the screens  while i was spraying the product i could see hundreds of them swarming around on my patio  the fogger spray by cutter has kept the bugs off of my front door which is how they get into my home several people commented that the plastic broke  i had the attachment screw pop off from the water pressure  i snapped it back on and then i turned down the water pressure  this solved the problem and it didn t pop off again  the instructions don t say how much to turn on the faucet but i would keep the stream low to prevent the problems other people had the area i treated is covered and we live in arizona so it should stay dry  i hope this product lasts the full 8 weeks  eliminated insect infestation on my patio,1,0
1298,my picky one year old cat loves this she will not eat any of the expensive wet food only friskies dry when i gave this to her she went nuts for it i couldn t find it at my local stores so i ordered it from here kind of expensive i went to walmart today and they had it for 2 50 a bag needless to say i stocked up i paid less for three bags at walmart than i did here for one the shipping cost more than the product and it is only a 3 oz  bag  good life catnip treat,1,0
1448,this is some high quality  pure marzipan  this grade of product doesn t need any candy coating or sugar on top  the flavor itself is very rich  the best way to eat this is in small bites because you ll end up eating all four loaf s in one sitting  in a big hurry  if you love marzipan  you owe it to yourself to at least give this one try  odds are you ll be ordering this on a regular basis  sometimes amazon doesn t have this on prime but when they do  i get some  don t get too much though  reading the nutritional information might give you heart palpitations  high quality that will make you eat it in one sitting ,1,0

369,i didn t read a very important part of the instructions on this product  shake well  it s very true  i use a clean  dry washcloth and sprayed it on the cloth  not the plant  it got runny and drippy and went down the stalks on my rubber plant when i sprayed it directly on the leaves   use the cloth in one hand and support the leaves with the other hand  pressing the leaf between your palms and working the spray into the leaf  yes  you have to do these individually  and yes  it takes time  after i went through the first time  i used another clean cloth and did it one more time to make sure that all the dust and years worth of grime was gone from the leaves  i then polished them with just the dry cloth to make sure the residue  droplets  was gone my rubber plants have never looked this good  my rubber plants have never looked this good ,1,0
368,if you re a fan of sweet  chewy  chocolate  granola  bars  this is for you  it s unclear to me how this is branded as  special k   however  as it tastes nothing like the cereal  i was somehow imagining that it would be composed of special k cereal  but the texture and taste is drastically different this isn t something i would buy regularly  as i generally prefer crunchy granola bars  such as nature valley   but for a quick occasional snack it isn t too bad  chocolatey  chewy  and good ,1,0
1601,at the beginning of 2012  good earth teas brought back the artificial flavoring formula  due to demand  but both versions are sold now   1  the older  artificial flavoring  version and  2  the newer  natural flavoring  version  here s how to tell them apart now quoting the customer service email                                for the caffeine free sweet   spicy tea   the 25 count boxes are made with natural flavoring   the 18 count boxes are now made with the artificial flavoring   this is the item that was revised about 6 months ago  though technically has been revised back to the original formula many stores will only carry one size  often the 18 count  so that may be a part of your confusion      if you look at the online store  you will see that we carry both sizes  http   shop goodearth com good earth original sweet and spicy caffeine free herbal tea p get 304012 c goodearth originalteas                       end of quote  customer service responded  the original formula had artificial flavoring  then they introduced natural flavoring,1,0
366,this was my first time ordering a japanese candy  from kracie  to be exact  i was so excited to receive it after watching many youtube videos about it  i must say  it was so much fun to make this  don t worry if you don t know japanese  as you can either watch instructional videos from youtube or follow the pictures  as they are thourough all of the different ingredients smelled wonderful  the rice smelled like bubblegum  the egg and meat smelled faintly like mango  the seaweed smelled like grape  the fish eggs and soy sauce smelled a bit like mango  but more of a fruitier smell now for the taste  i loved the taste of each one  as they weren t overpowering  but the textures are what really displeased me  the rice was really cool because of the feel in my hands  but in your mouth it tastes kind of stiff and grainy  i think that the worst texture was the meat and egg  they were so grainy that i could barely swallow them  and to top it off they were on top of the rice  yuck the best taste and texture had to be the fish eggs  they are little gel balls  just like that product from a long time ago that listerine made  it was breath freshener  mints   that were in the gelled ball form  and they exploded with liquid when you bit them  making your mouth feel fresh  i actually ended up saving the fish eggs instead of putting them on the sushi because i liked eating them  also  the soy sauce and the mixture that you put the fish eggs in tasted wonderful  with that faint fruity taste the product shipped the day after i order it  standard shipping   and came a week later  the first estimated delivery date   i was very happy about that  especially since it shipped from japan overall  i think if you are considering it  buy it  it is such a fun way to make candy  just beware of the rice  meat  and egg after you make it  very fun ,1,0

364,i ve been trying to wean myself off sucralose for some time and decided to try the pure stevia extract from  rhymes with  traitor schmoes   it was mediocre at best   bitter   then a couple of weeks ago  i was in my local natural foods store   i stop by there periodically and buy stuff simply to support local business   i saw a bottle of this product and the label s claim that it s  non bitter   so i sez to myself i sez  why not  brought it home  not expecting much   holy cr p   infinitely better than the competition   barely  if at all  bitter   and much less required to achieve equivalent sweetness  i use it primarily in my morning oatmeal and in lemonade and iced tea   i m actually able to measure how much i use  because the competition s product comes with a little coke spoon that hold 45 milligrams   i use two level spoonfuls of the nunaturals product to make a humongous bowl of very sweet oatmeal  with pumpkin and apple thrown in  or 24 ounces of lemonade   i m going to experiment with lower amounts   but even if i decide not to go lower  a 90 milligram serving  2 times 45 milligrams  is going to give me around 500 servings out of a one ounce bottle of nustevia   excellent product  wowstanding ,1,0
363,this sticky trap is way smaller than i have in mind but it really traps small insects in the garden  i was having some gnat problems and some other small garden insects that s why i purchased this  the next day after i put it a little under the leaves  i found a lot of insects trapped in it  there was even a moth  which was also another problem i had  when i put a new one again i didn t realized that it would be raining that night and it got wet  when i checked it though it was still really sticky enough to trap some more insects later so i didn t changed it  i didn t have to change each and everyone of it until full  i would suggest to put it in a place where butterflies won t get to it as the color seems to attract them too  it works ,1,0

1608,with this actually being marketed as  diet food   admittedly with a fairly funny view once i read the package  i really wanted to not like these  i ordered them as an  add on  item to a recent order  to make up the last of the 25  they do look quite odd  like skinny cheetos with a hole thru the middle however they taste absolutely fabulous  they have a sweet mildly onion y taste  and are really crispy for the price they are very  very good  it s a shame no stores sell these locally  but i will be ordering more next time i purchase on amazon com not what i expected ,1,0
1598,odd that you can get such a bold flavor of gum into a jar   it worked well for the cupcakes and frosting  flavorful,1,0
1609,didn t expect too much from these so i was surprised that with a few tweaks  i really liked them  i use 3 4 of a cup of water in a handled  plastic measuring cup and microwave for 4 minutes  using a spoonful of cream cheese to mix in the cheese powder seems to give the m c just that much more flavor and richness  the measuring cup is a convenient dish to eat from   not disposable  but hey  what are dishwashers for   and there s less trash  for fewer than 300 calories  not a bad meal  try these tweaks for a tasty meal ,1,0
1610,i wanted to echo the other positive reviews by folks that are  blown away  by the quality and taste of this product i have never spend  45 on a condiment before  like others i have used the  3 bottle of store bought balsamic vinegar  there is no comparison this stuff is thick and sweat  it has the viscosity of syrup  the flavors are rich and complex  this stuff adds an incredible eating experience when drizzled over a good cheese  it is delightful on avacado  i originally used it on a juicy heirloom tomato and was disappointed because the juice of the tomato watered down the syrupy goodness of the vinegar too much  to experience this product you do not want to water it down in any way i mixed 1 2 vinegar  1 2 olive oil with some minced garlic and onions  a little salt and pepper  it made a nice thick dressing that was to die for spooned over mixed greens  also  my concoction did not diminish the viscosity or the flavor of the vinegar in any way  when using this product you want the vinegar to always be at the center of the taste experience the biggest negative for this product is that once you try it there is no going back  and  at  45 a bottle it is priced like liquid gold  heck  i do not spend that much for a 1 5th of quality bourbon  i find myself checking the level in the bottle every time i open the cabinet  this stuff is a real treat to be experienced i am pretty frugal with how i spend my money  i never thought i would spend 45  on a bottle of vinegar  but this is not vinegar as you and i traditionally know vinegar  now  it is hard to imagine not having a bottle of this in our cupboard for those special occasions  wow,1,0

1611,ghirardelli cocoa is the best i ve tasted  and this combination of chocolate and cocoa is particularly good  when my local stores stopped carrying it  i had to start buying online presumably because of some sort of non competitive clause  the other vendor doesn t sell this product in my area  so i needed to purchase directly from ghirardelli  which charges over  9 for shipping  it arrived packed in those awful styrofoam peanuts  i wish they would just be honest about what they want to charge for the product and not pretend by larding up the shipping charges  tasty product  bad packaging,1,0

1613,i m on amazon to purchase 3 more of these traps because my 2 local national hardware chains do not carry them anymore  there are 2 advantages of the sweeney over others of the same type  1 it does not rust like the others  2  one of the spikes that support the trap in the ground  not the spikes that kill the mole  is turned sideways  making a wider path for the mole to come into  allowing him to be well under the  kill  spikes when the mechanism is sprung  yes  the mole is killed  not trapped  and alas  the spikes just wounded one mole  and i had to finish him off  ugh  but i digress  the trick with this type trap is to make certain that the portion of the tunnel where the trap is set is pressed down firmly so that the mole going through will actually push up the ground under the trap  also  especially when the ground is hard  it is difficult to depress the support spikes deep enough so that the  trigger plate  is at ground level  a must if you want it to actually release as the mole goes through  to overcome this  i make a channel in the ground where each support spike will be located by pounding a chisel into the ground  and then pulling it out of course   then you can easily depress the support spikes far enough into the ground so that the trigger plate is at ground level  one final clue  before you pull your sprung trap out of the ground  depress the tunnel area where the mole came from  that way  if the trap spikes nabbed only a non lethal part of the mole  you can stab him before he runs back through the tunnel  ugh again  sweeneys mole trap works great,1,0

1615,wow   this was awful you know how some barbeque sauces are sooo good you just can t stop eating   even when you re bursting and should stop   well  this one isn t it i had high hopes for this one as we love stone brewery and there was no high fructose corn syrup or any other unnatural sounding ingredients in it unlike phil s which was another bbq sauce sold at costco   where we bought this jug i took a chance and bought this to use it to make our 4th of july potluck contribution   shredded bbq chicken in the crock pot   first i cooked chicken breasts in the slow cooker with chicken broth and then shredded it and put it back in the cooker and was about to add the stone levitation ale barbeque sauce to it when i tasted it and thought  cr p  this tastes awful and i m going to have a lot left over at the potluck  but it gets four stars because it is easily doctored to taste good   and then you re left with a good tasting sauce with fairly healthy ingredients for those who  like me  thinks it s missing something and doesn t think it tastes good out of the bottle  my tip is to add sugar   i added a couple tbs white sugar and about 1 3 cup brown sugar to the half jug of sauce i mixed in with the chicken   then i went online to look at bbq sauce recipes to see what else i could put it there my research on the net got me adding a couple long squeezes of ketchup and about 1 4 cup apple cider vinegar   that did the trick   it is tasting like a real bbq sauce now   by the way  each time  i mixed the added ingredients with broth before adding it to the meat   and of course  add to your taste 4 stars for the doctored up version   next time i ll buy another brand or make my own from scratch  not my type of sauce   it needed major  repair ,1,0

1617,i have an 8 year old chihuahua named rico  he struggled with digestive issues when he was a puppy  his vet diagnosed him with a protein allergy and said he would always have to be on a hypo allergenic diet which is only available through vets with prescription  the food fixed rico s digestion problems  so i thought nothing else of it  a few years later  he started having seizures  awful  atypical seizures that would last for hours  we sought treatment from a neurologist who prescribed different medications  some of which didn t work  others made him loopy and unacceptably not himself  thanks to a wonderful woman who read my post on a pet md message board  i did research on the food rico was eating  not good   the food had an ingredient known to cause seizures  bha  though none of the numerous vets we saw even mentioned food as being a culprit  i immediately researched hypo allergenic  natural foods  against medical advice  i took him off the medication and started him on orijen 6 fish that day  he has not had a seizure since then  not one  i can t say enough good things about this food   and always doing your own research after consulting with professionals  my brother started feeding his dog this food  and i hope you ll consider doing the same  orijen 6 fish saved my dog s life,1,0
1618,we have a 5 year old saint bernard  it s hard to find treats that can stand up to her for more than 20 minutes so i thought i d give these a try  first one disappeared literally within 5 minutes  disappointing  gave her the second one and it lasted for 2 hours  i suspect the first was broken into pieces and chewed that way  whereas the second was chewed on as a single piece making it last longer  she did enjoy them   a lot  as for it i will buy one again  i m unsure  she did enjoy it but not enough for me to buy the ball that goes with to make them last longer  so my opinion  go ahead and buy it and your pooch is sure to enjoy it   but it s  50 50 if it s going to occupy them for 5 minutes or 2 hours  not everlasting but long lasting  the second time around ,1,0

1596,while i m not african american  i do have very crazy curly and dry hair  and on top of that  chemically treated  i have found that moisturizing isn t enough  one needs to nurture and constantly feed your hair  i ve used hair vitamins for a long time  and now when i saw this product that claims  intense scalp nourishing  i had to try it it comes with no instructions of use  so i had to do my own googling  here s the tiny bit of instruction i found       the first time i put it on i deemed it greasy  but the fact is it only feels that way at first  it seems that the roots actually drink it up because a little while later my hair was not extremely greasy  while the actual process of putting it on is a little bothersome  i really like it just to be clear  if you have thin oily hair  this is not for you  i  do  produce oil  so while i like the product and it smells good i still don t put it on as soon as i wash it  i wash my hair every 3rd day  so on that third day i apply it and wear it up  but i can feel a softer  not so dry hair and scalp now  i like it  but not for every day use,1,0
370,what i received was not roland  but hikarimiso  not a big deal  but kinda weird  i bought this to use in a vegan mock mac   cheese recipe  and i can tell it s going to be delicious because this stuff tastes so much like cheese it s scary  i m a miso noob  so i don t have a lot to say beyond that   dupdate  i wasn t sure how white miso is supposed to look  but i ve been checking out images online  and what i got is a dark red color  despite the packaging claim that it is white  it doesn t look anything like the white miso images i ve seen  light yellow color   is it spoiled  i called amazon and they are going to send me a replacement  i ll update again  when i receive it  smells   tastes great   but it was a different brand,1,0
380,i ve tried a wide selection of k cups including the big names like starbucks  tully s  donut house  dunkin donuts  etc and they all have something in common   either too watery  weak  or too bitter  strong   i tried breakfast in bed based on the reviews and i was not disappointed  it s flavorful without being strong or weak  it s hard to get a cup of coffee from a keurig that tastes like it was brewed like a normal coffee machine   this k cup is the exception   i ll be stocking up  great blend to get the day started   ,1,0
1570,this was my first purchase of highland sugarworks organic grade a dark amber maple syrup  but i promise you that it will not be my last   it was very flavorful  but not overpowering and a perfect addition to my french toast this morning   if you like real maple syrup  not the fake corn syrup garbage  you will not be disappointed with this syrup  my new favorite maple syrup  ,1,0
1571,my dog likes to suck off the brown meat flavored part in the twist and then leaves the remainder for the dust bunnies under my bed  even still  i ll continue buying these as he seems to truly love them  or part of them  and it s about 2 00 less on amazon than what the local pet store has them for  shame they don t have just the brown meaty part as a treat itself     tasty treat    sort of ,1,0
1572,must agree with the reviewers here in that the last batch was not so good  but i just received a new batch  07 01 2012   leaves are much greener than the older batch  taste is much nicer and fresher too  consistancy problems,1,0
1573,in comparing this fleur with roland s fleur from le de r eacute  i would say this fleur has a crisper texture and a sharper aftertaste   in a straight test taste i would go with roland s fleur  but on food i think one is splitting hairs between the two   i may update this review update after more food experimentation  crisp texture  somewhat sharp taste,1,0
379,bought these to fill boxes as favors for my upcoming wedding   they came speedily  and well packaged  couldn t be more pleased  for anyones reference  i bought a total of 15 pounds  and have atleast a pound of extras after filling 213 boxes with 5 6 kisses each  lots and lots of kisses ,1,0
1574,i have had folgers carmel drizzle before and loved it  it has just enough sweet to it without being overpowering  however  when i ordered this product on amazon i recieved the folgers silk black dark roast i gave them 5 stars for the coffee it is describing just be prepared that they might send you the wrong item  wrong item,1,0
378,i don t usually eat popcorn   it s either too boring  too buttery  or too salty   i avoid popcorn   life is too short for bland snacks corbra corn mumbai masala popcorn is a very special exception   it is so bold and flavorful it s almost more than i can handle   almost  best popcorn ever ,1,0
1576,i like to drink just about anything wet that is called tea  including several green teas  some even unique teas that come people bring back from home fields in china  in vietnam there were french tea plantations  i spent a year there with out sugar so i learned to not use it  and i even drink different chai teas  so i figured being eclectic i had no taste  however once i tried twinings of london english breakfast tea i found it to be full flavored and not one dimensional  i do not use any additives so the tea has to taste good without sugar  cream  or whatever after slurping my way through several of these 50 bag boxes i had an opportunity to try that other stuff from sir thomas lipton and had to spit it out i forgot what it used to taste like   i cannot say it is the company or the tea mix but i find that i am now addicted to this tea  even though i can still drink other types of tea that black and pekoe stuff just does not cut it  strange the twinings box also says black tea so i guess there is black tea and then again there is black tea  however this tea is so much richer  you can never go back,1,0
1577,i got this tea super cheap and it s pretty good  main point  it s organic  organic and tea and cheap are usually not things that go together  is it gourmet  no  but it s the best i ve seen for the price  so for value  five stars  easy  if this was thirty dollars a box however  i would be on here writing a one star review mild green tea flavor  no grassyness  not a ton of theanine  just guessing by how it makes me feel  but enough  medium caffeine content  on the low end but not non existent only complaint  on the package is a picture of a tea cup with what looks like high end gyokuro or something  full leaf leaves floating in it  rip open a bag though and you find dust  not a problem at all really  just silly to put that on the box when that s in no way what s inside  five for the price ,1,0
1578,people who but this pack are looking for a fun candy for family or friends to share   they are pretty good but i will have to admit jb struggled with these flavors   making cocktail flavors in a bean is not really possible they were fun and if you want these  you wont be disappointed pay the price though   jb is always way overpriced for a the few tiny sugar bullets you get in the massive packaging  nice flavors  but as overpriced as anything from jb,1,0
377,not all dog food is the same  the cheap dog food has tons of fillers in it  not healthy for your dog and they have to eat more to feel full  and they don t get what they need  my boston behaves much better with this food over the cheap stuff  do yourself   your dog a favor and check out this dog food  you won t be disappointed  great stuff  one healthy dog with this food ,1,0
1580,these are great as a treat  but not as a chew  they are so well liked they don t last  what i can t understand is why a seller that offers amazon prime charges albout 3 to 4 times the cost that other prime sellers are charging for the same items and think they will make a profit  i guess it s buyer beware and be a bargain shopper if you don t want to seriously overpay  treat not a chew bone,1,0
376,my hair is long and thick  and it s dry   this conditioner made it soft and silky  so it performs well for me   i suspect it might be a bit too heavy for those with thin or fine hair   it has a pretty standard hair product smell  not offensive  left a bit of scent on my hair   it opens very easily in the shower  which is a plus   the only problem i had was in shipping the bottle opened and it leaked   as i got this form vine  my shipping might be different from a regular order   the bottle really does need to be shrink wrapped or otherwise held shut  as it snaps open far too easily   not an issue for me getting a bottle i didn t pay for  but paying customers will need more effective packaging  soft hair,1,0
1583,i ve been using dr  harvey s veg to bowl for about 6 months and my 2 dogs seem to love it  at least they eat it and finish most of what they get  a few words of wisdom  the product package says to let it rehydrate for 8 10 minutes  i have found this to not be enough time and really needs closer to about 20 mins or even longer  i like to put the hot water in upon waking up  walk the dogs and then have a cup of coffee when i get back and then feed them  it s about 20 minutes and enough time for the veggies to rehydrate  if they dont rehydrate completely they are harder  and while my dogs will eat them  you will see the undigested remains in their stool  i know  yuck  but hey it s just veggies  sometimes i put the water in right before bed so when i wake they are fully rehydrated  saves a little time in the morning  last thing on the product  as much as i love amazon  and i do  i get about 2 4 packages a week at times  their prices on this are much higher than what i pay for it at unleashed by petco  i havent looked elsewhere for it but it s about  6 cheaper than the amazon price  not  6 off the retail price  the actual amazon price  so for me it s a no brainer  despite the convenience of home delivery  i ll walk the few blocks to my local store and buy the veggies there  if anyone from amazon reads this  c mon guys  you er a big supplier  get with it and lower the price or this is one product i will continue to buy elsewhere  great product cheaper elsewhere,1,0
1584,these are great  supposed to be sugar free but you would never know it  the only thing when ripping them apart they do not separate easy at times and i tore one and it started leaking all over the place  there is not too many of them and they go too quick  each one is   50 cents a piece  i thought this was a tad bit high  flavorice is good stuff though  watch out for cutting your mouth on the plastic as well  it is a little sharp or can be  i want to buy them again but i think they cost too much  good tasting treat but at a high price,1,0
1585,xango is a great tasting product that is beneficial for your health  unfortunately  the cost from the xango company itself is too high  i would personally only buy from this seller  thanks again  great product to have ,1,0

1595,the sauce is awesome  but look around for a better price   i was able to order elsewhere for  5 95 bottle   these guys are gouging you on price  the item isn t all that scarce  outrageous price,1,0
372,these have great ingredients and smell so good  i wanted to eat it lol  however they are really hard so if your dog isn t a big chewer  like mine  it s not such a good idea  brownie stopped trying after 30 minutes  so these are going to be donated to the animal shelter  these are for medium to large dogs  not so much for small dogs unless they re really aggressive chewers  smells great  but     ,1,0
1593,the food seems to be very agreeable to my 2 pugs  16 yrs old and 6  and my boxer 11 months old   he was the one i noticed who had food allergies   he would have hives on his coat and my teacher mentioned duck being a good meat and then i saw that this brand was the only one that had lots of real duck as it source and not whatever duck stuff  awome pricing ,1,0
1592,i love this sauce  however  it is vastly overpriced here   i bought the same size original sauce for 89 cents at safeway  overpriced here ,1,0
373,this is a good companion to a french press device   i didn t find it too strong  which means coffee enthusiasts that prefer their coffee too strong  might not like it  but hey  if you think its a good idea  why not use two bags instead of one   marley coffee also claims to be organic  so if you are into organic stuff  this could be worth your while  pretty good medium roast flavor ,1,0

374,i gently shook my taste can before trying this  although the can says not to   knowing that coffee drinks can settle   i had it chilled overnight to try after breakfast   it s not bad  but where is the coffee flavor   my first taste was definitely chocolate   my second sip revealed some graininess   i taste no annoying additives  or anything overly bitter or even too sweet   the coffee was like a tasty afterthought and i like this taste combination   but for the price that is charged for this  i can think of another major coffee company that sells these in small glass bottles for quite a bit less this drink s ingredients are   coffee  lowfat milk  sugar  cocoa powder  potassium bicarbonate  citrate  cellolose gel  potassium citrate  cellulose gum  carrageenan there are 81mg of caffeine in one can serving and 100 calories per can each can has 5mg cholesterol  60mg sodium  19g total carbs  and 4g protein this product is made in denmark and distributed by the coca cola company my biggest gripe is the price  chocolately,1,0
1590,i have been trying to lose those last 10 pounds that are so hard   i had heard about raspberry ketones on dr  oz and had a couple friends taking them with success   i have used african mango in the past and had success with that so i thought i would try something that had both in it   this product also has green tea  acai  caffiene  apple cider vinegar and a couple other things   so far  it seems to be working   it gives me extra energy with the caffiene and i ve lost about 5 lbs in 2 weeks  just a few more pounds,1,0

1588,a few human flavors mixed with some amazingly gross and disgusting flavors   im not going to tell you about them  find out yourself i tell you though   how bertie figures out how to make them taste so realistic is scary   my kids and i had a great deal of fun with these  actually the fun is not over   mama doesnt know the nasty beans have been mixed in her regular beans  and she never reads reviews  hehheh easily worth the 4 50 i paid for the 2 pack wonderfully disgusting  dont pay more than 5 bucks for the 2 pack ,1,0

1586,wanted to sample a variety of different coffees   teas before purchasing a big box   received 3 hot cocoa  2 cider drink mixes  3 cappuccino  4 teas    the rest are various types of coffee   the brands include  wolfgang puck  barista prima  brooklyn bean roastery  donut house  donut shop  starbucks  kahlua  caribou  gloria jean s  green mountain  revv  tully s  newman s own  grove square  cafe escapes  celestial seasonings    bigelow   received very quickly   and the k cups do come in a paper bag  but the bag is inside of an amazon box   if it was wrapped in plastic  the flavor of the coffee might be affected   i am very happy with my purchase   will order from this seller again  great assortment of coffees   teas,1,0
1591,my toddler really likes this flavor  and i like its convenience   however  the packaging is misleading   the main ingredient is not kale   in fact  this product lists  kale juice concentrate  as its sixth ingredient   this is a good source of apple and mango but not kale  convenient and healthy,1,0
1569,there are two components of a review about dog food for me   do the dogs like it   and is it good for them to answer the first  my dogs love it   we had just finished a bag of feed so i opened this and they instantly started smelling the air as i poured it from the bag into their feed container   from there i scooped out their usual quantity into each bowl and where they usually follow me with interest to where i set the bowls down for them to eat  this time they fairly pranced   leaping up and down with excitement at the  treat  that was in store for them   on their old food  they would eat until they were full but often wander away with a little food left in the bottom to come back to later   this time  they finished the bowl and then licked it clean   so it certainly passed the taste test next is the question as to whether or not it is good for them   i gave it a 4 because the overall ingredients are not terrible   the first ingredient is meat   the first rule of thumb for me in any pet food   however the second two ingredients are soy products  followed by brewers rice  more soy and then corn   included in the ingredients is also wheat   so although it starts well  with beef as the first ingredient  in the end it is bulked out by grains of all sorts  which lower the production costs for the manufacturer and keep the food priced lower for the consumer but also lowers the nutritional benefit to the animal one last comment   my first impression when i scooped the food into the bowls was that it is designed to look like a stew  visually  it contains brown chunks   the meat   small green balls   the peas   and similarly sized yellow balls   the corn   the problem is that a bowl of stew containing meat  peas and corn sounds yummy to us and is  in fact  designed to appeal to us visually   but is not a diet i would feed my dogs   and  since dogs rely on smell more than vision  the visual appeal would be lost on them   so i guess i didn t really appreciate what felt like a  trick  to get us to think of this as a good wholesome food for the dogs  dogs love it,1,0
1623,i love this cereal and was so excited to find it at warehouse clearout pricing  likely because the expiry date is a month away the cereal does have a strange smell to it   sort of chemical like  i have a very good sense of smell  so i really notice it however  it tastes fine  and the smell sort of dissipates if you leave the bag open for a little while before eating it i purchased 18 bags of the stuff  so i am happy that it had no bad taste i threw them in all in the freezer as there is no way i am going to eat all 18 bags in one month  but i had read a review that the expiry date might be soon  so i was prepared for that i think they did change their receipe  but i didn t really notice as i didn t buy it much prior to recently  it does get mushy in milk  but what cereal doesn t much more filling than chex i am happy with the purchase   much better than  8  10 per bag that i have been paying at the grocery store here in ontario  great cereal but does have a strange smell,1,0
356,sweet bbq taste  a bit of salty  a bit of pepper  not dry  this product does not disappoint  i thought it would taste like an old piece of pork    you know that flavor  but nope   this is a wonderful snack when chips are not an option  high protein  low carb fat  breakfast of champions  great for low carb diets  pure nomness  and not porky tasting  great for low carb diets ,1,0
1658,this isn t really designed to be an  energy drink   i don t even think there is any caffeine in it  i don t know why it is marketed that way in america  if you drink one of these while you are out drinking  you won t feel hung over the next morning   drinking one after being hung over is probably too late  i ve tested this concept out a lot and it seems to really help  my friends agree too  hang over preventor in japan,1,0
1659,this pertains to the das salt with the white and blue labeling  if you ve never tried it  you won t believe how different it is from what you think of as  salt      it s not salty  not in the stringent  nacl kind of way  instead  it just adds flavor  lots and lots of little tiny bits of flavor  none of which stand out enough to be identifiable  at least  not yet to me   but all of which are certainly detectable as a difference over whatever you were used to it tasting like before   and if you ve eaten kcl and are thinking of that   bah  rinse your mouth   whisk with oil and vinegar for salads  sprinkle it on fresh veggies  we even put a pinch in watermelon puree for smoothies  for things that are supposed to be a little bit salty  try 50 50 this and your kosher salt  maybe after a quick pass with a pestle  it s called salt  but is a totally different ingredient than the other stuff  my new go to housewarming and  what to give when i have no idea  present  makes good food better,1,0
340,weary of what others had written  i ordered these  i instantly liked them  so much in fact  i ate too many  i got a headache i got mine during 70 degree weather  and they were soft and chewy and stretchy  they are very juicy  and have a natural taste to them  which i expected  after all  no artificial stuff in these   they come in portion appropriate bags  where each little bag has 90 calories  there are about 15 bears in each bag  red  orange and yellow  i liked the yellow ones best when they arrived i was eager to get into the bag to taste  so i tried to open it by pulling on the sides to open in the top  this was not very successful  i eventually noticed the slit at the top  which facilitates opening by pulling it open on the side i am giving this 4 stars because i had a problem stopping eating these  and as a result i got a nasty sugar head ache and an icky feeling in my tummy  if i had more self discipline  i would have given these 5 stars  but they are irresistible  yummy,1,0
339,if you are looking for a great tasting  not bitter coffee  this is it   it is a million times better than any of the big chain coffes including starbucks   love this coffee  you will not be dissapointed   can be hard to find as i assume it is a regional item but well worth the money  not your mama s coffee,1,0
1660,i did not buy this at first because i figured it was another gimmick all shampoos guarantee they are the best thing for your hair etc this product is worth the money and i saw results after one use and keep seeing healthy hair after each continued use prosnice scent that lastshair is shiny and not weighed down by excessive producthair visibly looks healthiercons if you are used to a thick coverage with your shampoo conditioner  i e lather and creamy conditioner  this probably isn t the product for you  small container sizeremember this is not a regular shampoo and conditioner so it is not suppose to be used as one make sure to read directions before you use so you can see maximum results  a hair must have,1,0
338,i thought i would use this like coconut milk but oh no  i didn t  it is like a coconut butter  along the lines of peanut almond etc    please be prepared to enjoy it and have to stop yourself  fyi it is too firm if put in the fridge like the package recommends  when i got it it was soft and separated like oil and coconut  just squish it all together and  go for it  unexpected treat,1,0

335,i checked the label and there isn t any higher percentage of protein than other brands   some reviewers of merrick cautioned about the high protein at last check  i don t think these were on the recall list  dog loves both the cans and dry version of merrick food ,1,0
334,i am pleased that these are made from whole wheat flour and not  enriched  wheat flour  furthermore  even though brown sugar and sugar and the numbers 3   4 ingredients respectively  this cereal is not too sweet  if you like cinnamon and shredded wheat then you re sure to like this  whole wheat goodness   not too sweet,1,0
333,i don t need to double bag them  as another suggested i put a folded piece of newspaper or paper waste on the bottom  carry them to the trash in the plastic bin and there have been no problems  the 13 gal seem sturdier than the 10 gal  great bags,1,0

1657,potassium chloride tastes terrible   let me say that again   potassium chloride  the  salt  that makes up salt substitutes tastes really  really bad   sure   it s salty   but it s not salty in the way that sodium chloride is salty   adding flavors to it doesn t help  ie garlic salt substitute is just as horrible as regular salt substitute    neither does adding lysine   nosalt and also salt    both terrible so what do you do if you are like the average person who has severe sodium potassium imbalance leading to high blood pressure  get losalt   lord almighty  it s only 1 3 sodium chloride and 2 3 potassium chloride and it tastes almost exactly like real salt   more importantly  it actually tastes good   as in you won t cringe putting this stuff on your food   who would have thought mixing the potassium chloride with sodium chloride  regular salt  would make it palatable there is room for improvement   for example  i d love it if this stuff came in different ratios   you get used to 1 3 sodium chloride then  after a few months  lower it to like 10    who knows how much real salt needs to be in there to make it bearable  5   less    also  a healthy dose of magnesium would be nice   magnesium deficiency is one of the major players in high blood pressure and pain in the rear to supplement but let s not get sidetracked here   the bottom line is  if you are reading this  your probably have high blood pressure and are desperately looking for a salt substitute that won t make you puke   this is the only one   i ve tried them all  the only good salt substitute,1,0
1669,this is the second time i have ordered a gallon of extra virgin olive oil thru amazon  the big problem was opening the spout  first  the plastic ring was glued down  second it was impossible to pull out the spout after i losened the ring  until i punched a small hole in a corner of the top to allow air to replace the air needed to fill the spout as it was extended i will go back to amato next time  terrible time opening the can,1,0
331,the best flavor of all the ones tried  and i tried them all   i put in a couple of ounces of bolthouse farms   32 g  per bottle protein     mocha cappuccino    instead of creamer  then just put in your k cup of caramel cappuccino    yum   grove square caramel cappucino k cups,1,0

1671,works  i have a terrible invasion of bermuda grass in a landscaped non grass area after removing a large tree exposing the area to direct sunlight in southern california  did not see any results  the  leaves  will turn brown  until about 10 days after the first application  directions state to re apply after 7 days and do not cut the  grass  during this period  one 24 oz bottle does not cover much of an area as you must spray directly on the  leaves   i have a approximately 200 sqft area and one 24 oz bottle was not enough for one application  i would recommend buying 4 24 s or the 40 oz container if you have the same or more than a small area like mine  product does not seem to affect any of the other plants as well  will be interesting to see if this very invasive grass comes back as rizoles  sp  grow up to 1 foot underground making any mechanical removal virtually impossible in a developed area  grass b gone works ,1,0
330,i too received something a little different than the pictured item   the added grapefruit and cayenne may or may not be contributing to the effect but after 2 weeks my appetite has decreased   i didn t have much faith but i figured the price was right so i could give it a try   my weight hasn t gone down but i definately do not crave sweets as much and my energy level is higher and i sleep better  granted i am working out more so that could be the reason for the better sleep  seems to work,1,0
329,the plants arrived within a few days and were very healthy   they arrived wrapped with wet paper around the roots and the paper was still wet  complete instructions were included and the seller followed up to make sure everything was ok and was available if there were any questions   i was very pleased with the purchase   the plants were planted a week ago and are doing very well  carnivorous plants,1,0
328,i had a bag of these during a trip to london  i was looking for walker s frazzles but this was the only bacon flavored chips i could find at the tesco  the taste is very similar to frazzles if not better  it tastes just like bacon  even suitable for vegetarians  tastes just like bacon ,1,0
1673,i assess my warm beverages in a series of steps  this was my experience with cafe escapes chai latte  which was brewed as a larger 9 1 4 oz  serving in my keurig b40 step 1   blow steam off the top of the freshly brewed chai tea latte  inhale deeply  the thick aroma of sugar and spice is promising and surprisingly flavorful   i had seen a lot of water pouring out of the keurig and into my mug during the brewing process   it s so disappointing to get a whiff of something delicious  only to taste a watered down version of it when i take a sip  so i hope that i won t be let down this time step 2   sip gingerly with my eyes closed  hooray for follow through  even when brewed in a large mug  i would say that this chai is as flavorful as its aroma promises  it has a perfect balance of sweetness and spiciness  also  at least when brewed in a large mug   it wouldn t be too harsh on the palates of those who aren t fans of spicy chai drinks  moreover  although this chai is creamy  it isn t so rich that it would be a chore to drink it from start to finish step 3   wait for aftertaste  or lack thereof  i am happy to report that this chai tea latte doesn t have that thick  sour  curdled milk aftertaste that i sometimes experience with chai tea lattes from start to finish  this chai was exactly what i was hoping it would be  however  if you want your chai on the spicy side  you may want to try brewing a more concentrated 7 1 4 oz  version of it  or look for another brand cheers  creamy  sweet  spicy  and aromatic from start to finish ,1,0
327,i am not a fan of brown sugar  but decided to give this a try   i was pleasantly surprised   the flavor is very good   i could barely detect brown sugar and i really did not mind it   not in a sense that i had to tolerate the flavor  but that i really enjoyed it i liked that this cereal is not too sweet   i tried it as a snack by itself and with milk  and liked it both ways   however  my 4 year old son tried a piece and said he did not like it  i am guessing because it is not as sweet as his usual honey comb  cheerios  and trix stuff oh well  more for me  very good,1,0
1675,this tastes like the seasonings on bbq potato chips  so i like this one  it might just be my batch  but it doesn t seem to flow out of the shaker as smoothly as the other flavors though  and like all of these seasonings not all of the seasoning will stick to the popcorn and will wind up at the bottom of the bag or bowl  i don t think there is a way to get all the seasoning to stick unless you drench every single kernel of popcorn in butter spray  this stuff is cheap enough i don t mind  and keeps me out of the high fat and high calorie snacks  bbq popcorn,1,0
1676,good salt  you can use it generously  as its not very salty  it should give you a nice dose of trace minerals too  not very salty,1,0

1678,i used to get these from my local stop and shop   then one day they just did not carry them any more   turns out nestle decided not to make and distribute these in the us   in any event  if you read all the reviews on this bar you will see that no one has said they did not like the bar  even the 1 star reviews    the low rated reviews only complain about the shipping cost   i don t blame them of course   you will pay significant shipping to get them from overseas   it is all just a question of how badly you want them   as it turns out    i want them badly these bars have an excellent chocolate covering   not thick but just right   you can taste the quality of the chocolate readily as it melts on your tounge   it is a very high quality milk chocolate   it is not in any way like a hershey chocolate these bars have what is called a  sponge  candy center   indeed  this is the bar  one six inch long sponge candy bar covered in wonderful milk chocolate   i love the way it breaks up under my teeth  and then melts in my mouth   wonderful texture and flavor as i get on in years  and after two glimpses at death  though all is fine   i have concluded that i no longer need to anguish so much over spending money and that as long as i remember how my fellow man is suffering elsewhere and do something about it  it is ok for me to enjoy the things i like   so i order them and pay the shipping and relish the fact that my favorite candy costs 6  bar and i am royalty  for a moment hail flavius  my favorite candy  not available is us anymore  bummer,1,0
326,this is delicious   the first night i opened the jar  i found myself looking for something anything  to spread this on   there s nothing artificial in it  but it s not  healthy   and it s not a peanut butter substitute  it is sugary sweet and definitely a dessert spread   as other reviewers have mentioned  it is awfully pricey online  and even if someone is reselling it  is it necessary to charge over 3x the price   it s not like it s being imported from overseas  they re just picking it up at the local tj s  delicious,1,0
325,lately i have been suffering from dry scalp  so when this product was offered  i thought that i would give it a try  after all  i had nothing to lose  what i found was a product that i liked  first  i love the easy to use applicator  once open  you can part your hair and apply the oil to your scalp  not your hair  after applying a small amount  which was super easy with this applicator  to those areas on my scalp that felt a little dry and itchy  i simply massaged my scalp and styled my hair  secondly  i didn t find it to be too greasy  but maybe that was because i was placing the product directly to the scalp and not to the hair itself  third  i didn t mind the smell  unlike some who have reviewed this product  i didn t find it too overwhelming  it is tropical smelling   but again i was only placing a small amount on the scalp  finally  i found the product to be affordable and comparable  especially when compared to other hair oils  overall  i thought this product did exactly what it said it would   it provides nourishment to dry itchy hair  i give it a 4  i liked it ,1,0
332,while our dog smiley will eat just about anything off of the street  she is picky about her inside food  we finally agreed on science diet senior and that has worked for almost a year  but when i saw this bag of beneful listed on vine  i couldn t turn it down  luckily  smiley really likes it  my only concerns are the extra additives  which is why i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars  smiley likes it,1,0

1655,this product makes me want to buy a miracle fruit tree so i can have these awesome berries all the time the biggest changes my husband and i noticed were in eating fruits   other berries  store bought strawberries  blueberries  raspberries  blackberries  oranges  and green apples tasted like they were just picked off the plant bush tree at the height of ripeness  it was like being a kid again and biting into my first   i didn t notice any change at all with anything bitter  beers and coffees and teas tasted about the same  spicy things like hot sauce tasted kind of gross  savory things like noodles and meat got a slight hint of sweetness  but nothing that noticeable  sweet things like candy and cake were made to be way too sweet to be palatable definitely make sure you get the tablet to slide all over your tongue  and don t chew    leave it on your tongue until it dissolves if you re a fan of sweet  succulent fruit  but can t get fresh produce from farmer s markets  do yourself a favor and try these  it s worth the price for the fun  at the very least    awesome ,1,0

355,i don t have lawn so i thought i could live with moles peacefully  as long as they don t destroy my landscaping  after two years those moles start popping up anywhere they want and dirt piles here and there  they are out of control  i have tried many baits and that ultra sound thing  none of them work  i can t live with the moles anymore because my landscaping is being turned up side down by them i first bought one trap  after two weeks nothing happened  then i bought another three  with all of these  i can make a trap field  i planted them last evening and this morning i went to check  wahoo  one trap was triggered  i haven t looked at that it caught  but i am so sure there is a mole caught  i am so happy to write this review right after i saw the triggered trap i think the most important thing is that  since mole is hard to track  you should use several traps together  also on youtube  there is a very nice video shows you how to set this trap up   build a dirt bridge  use some fresh tree leaves  etc  carefully designing the trap field that was also contribute to the success     i went to dig the mole out  this is my first experience on how a mole look like  it is very    yuck  caught the mole within 12 hours ,1,0
715,i dont know  i really tried to like it but just couldnt get over the taste   i think my review might have been biased so i went to the dogs   i have three and they all liked it   they ate it and wanted more   to bad i didnt give them any   the biggest  chief  gave it 2 paws up and well  tipped over sideways   he was very happy with it though   my smallest  coco  decided to hide hers for later   all in all it really is a good priced item and even though my dogs will eat anything they liked this stuff   nothing bad to say about it   i tried it on one more dog  my parents  and she doesnt eat anything   well  she ate this stuff  i tried it and didnt like it  dogs did though ,1,0

354,i ordered the super dwarf cavendish along with musa truly tiny   they shipped them together and gave me a refund on the second shipping   although the sdc was smaller than expected less than 4   it is a healthy plant it was not damaged in shipping   it was packed very well as were both plants    they shipped very fast  i will insert a picture if i can figure it out  small but healthy ,1,0
1630,the petite one is tiny which wasn t easily discernible from the description   they should include sample dog breeds for each size do you know which one to buy   but the product seems well made despite the description being lacking  in my opinion   no smell and the color shape keeps my pupp very interested the petite one is for very small dogs   chihuahua  min pin  etc   think  under 15 pounds the regular size  wolf  is for medium dogs   beagles on the small end up to 50 65 pounds the giant size  souper  is for very large dogs over 65 pounds  excellent for chewers,1,0
1631,i still really  really enjoy the mccann s steel cut oats so much  see earlier review  that i decided to order the six  large 72 ounce containers this time   the packaging is not adequate for the weight of the oats   the cardboard tubes crushed in shipping  forcing the seals and plastic lids to come off  so i had a box of half filled containers and oats strewn all over the shipping box   i called amazon to report the problem  and they replaced the order  which i really appreciated their doing  since it was a grocery product that is not returnable in normal circulstances    and  sadly  the second order came in the same crushed  disheveled condition   i salvaged the oats left in the containers from the two orders  so feel like my order has been fulfilled with something i can use   but won t be ordering in this size anymore  mccann s steel cut oats   still great   this 72 ounce packaging   not good,1,0

353,on a positive note  green mountain hot cocoa is one of the few  hot cocoa  products that is not made with hydrogenated oils   i  like some other reviewers  had a problem with it clumping in some  not all  of the k cups   what you end up with is chocolate flavored water   yuck   it didn t occur to me to shake them up before putting in the keurig   what i did with the remainder of the box was open them up  empty in cup  and then put boiling water in cup   they do have a good milk chocolate flavor and for a richer taste you can make with boiling hot milk   since i didn t trust these k cups to work everytime  it seemed like a waste of money to buy them so i started buying bulk powder mix such as ghirardelli   starbucks hot cocoa  brands that do not contain hydrogenated oils either   pros   cons,1,0

1635,this product is of as high a quality as nestea  no artificial colors and no acesulfame potassium  arizona teas still have this  only sucralose which cspi ranks as  probably safe    it is probably the safest artificial sweetener   this product also contains a small amount of powdered honey  a little over 2 grams to get to the 10 calorie stick    it is not marked as to where it is made would be 5 star if marked   i am picky  mango pinapple is one of the varieties that contains caffeine  strawberry acai is decaffeinated  much better than their old products,1,0

344,they arrived before expected  which was not an inconvenience luckily as i was home to receive the product i read and re read all the reviews on here about the oysters and decided to take a chance  i am glad i did they arrived wonderfully packed with ice packs  of course you have to eat them the same day as soon as possible  i never intended these oysters to be eaten raw half shell  i tried one  and it was not up to par freshness wise  duh  and they were always intended for the grill  as i was hosing them down in the backyard on my patio with a garden hose and attachment  i thought once again of the complaints people had that they are full of silt well  nothing worth doing is ever easy  so i lovingly sprayed each one  giving them a once over  and it gave me the chance to pick out ones that were open and toss the meat into my vegetable garden as fertilizer  out of the stack  only 4 or 5 were bad overall  from sniff test  if you work for your food  it tastes better  regardless  the oysters did not arrive any more clumped than at a restaurant  nor were they absolutely covered in silt the way they are just as they are fished out of the charleston bay  if you are expecting them to be grocery store clean  you by all means pay grocery store price  some of them had gorgeous shells and the barnacles were shaved off  thank you so much now the sad part  i did find that the oysters lacked any kind of noisette  i didn t overcook them on the roaster  even when i had the two raw  it failed to excite me the way blue point or kumamoto does  they were also cleaned to the point that all saltiness in the brine were non existent  i had to toss some fleur de sel over each one to bring back some sort of saltiness there was a point where i was shucking the roasted oysters and was smelling some really ripe ones  i thought there would be a really nasty oyster in there that i had missed  giving out this foul garbage pail odor  it turned out  in fact  to be my 23 month old son  walking past me with a stinky diaper  i had to laugh   so as a recap  i would buy from them again when i have another oyster roast  i wouldn t get these for eating raw  i love the prompt delivery  and the product arrived in excellent condition    honestly,1,0
1643,this shampoo seems to give good results  although  perfume  is much higher in the ingredients  list than are the supposedly more important additives    and i have no idea what makes this product better formulated for men than for women   i give it four stars because it does seem to give good results  although the anti dandruff ingredient is the same that s used by hundreds of other such shampoos and the product also has scores of ingredients  which is par for the course for such hair care products   as a man  that makes me a little suspicious  especially with  perfume  being so high up the list   but this clear shampoo didn t smell too strong  not an easy product to rate ,1,0
345,i like how the chews taste faintly like the real fruit  however  only eat a few chews  because i accidentally ate all of them in the same day  and felt sick of them afterward  now i really don t want to ever eat them again  the mango and melon smell a bit odd when you open them  but taste fairly good i was bummed because i dislike artifical and real banana flavor  and the majority of the chews were banana  i still ate them  it s just that i wasn t a big fan of them the chewiness was odd  kind of tough  yet kind of soft if you like chewy fruits in exotic flavors  then buy them  it s interesting,1,0

1216,this product met my expectations very well   the flavor wasn t quite what i expected  however   i expected a cinnamon flavor with subtle hints of hazelnut and vanilla   instead  i found that all three flavors are pretty evenly distributed   the end result is a cacophony of flavors which is very powerful and distracts from the natural coffee flavor the beans themselves are rather small   because of this  i think  the coffee is rather weak   i find myself having to use 30  more coffee per pot than with my traditional coffee beans   the cup  when poured black  has a very weak color to it  if you add creamer the look is very reminiscent of tea with milk when i first tried the coffee i was very unhappy with the results   however  after tweaking the amount of grounds i use  as well as increasing the coarseness of my grounds  i found a product that was palatable would i buy it again   probably not   however  i can see many people who dislike strong coffee truly enjoying this  weak  but tasty ,1,0

1488,this food has been a lifesaver  literally  according to my vet  for my 10 year old   for years he had really nasty  i mean at times explosive  diarrhea and i tried everything from prescription foods  making my own  raw food  medication   nothing worked   this helped almost from the first bite   only the rabbit formula worked  none of the poultry the problem    very inconsistent   one bag might be great and the next one he won t eat and or it causes problems   i finally bought based on expiration date and when i found one that worked i stocked up   there is another review posted here that talks about a formula change  but i didn t notice a connection   the food does look different one expiration date to the next  darker or lighter  the size of the kibble changes  i met a dealer at an expo and he seemed far from interested in hearing about the problem   if your cat is really sensitive it is definitely worth trying out   be prepared for occasional problems and wasted      but it can work miracles  inconsistent but a lifesaver,1,0
1491,i love this product   i ve heard alot about the sodastream and finally decided to purchase one  and as i drink a lot of red bull  mainly as a cocktail mixer   i gave this mix a try   quite impressed on just how i can t really tell the difference between this energy drink sodamix and red bull  other than the price   on average i spend about  2 25 per can of red bull  and this sodamix will yield 50 8oz servings  so easy math says  112 for 50 cans of red bull or  6 99 for the sodastream energy drink sodamix 16 9 fl oz bottle and 50 8oz servings   and as not to be biased  i have a few friends who also drink red bull who all agreed that it was a toss up on tasting the difference between the two products  and how much money could be saved  energy drink vs red bull,1,0
1492,if you want something to chew on that doesn t have a lot of calories  this puffed corn will do it  it doesn t have any taste to speak of  and that s fine with me  i just wanted something to chew on while watching the teevee like someone said  it is a lot like plain pop corn without any salt or butter if all you care about is taste  this doesn t have any  but if you can get your oral gratification with something chewy that won t do your body any harm  this is a good option  something to chew on,1,0
413,had this item shipped as a gift  my sister seemed to enjoy it   it was delivered to her apartment complex concierge though  rather than directly to her door   they sat on the package for about a week  and apparently the cheese and salami didn t spoil without refrigeration   this is evidenced by the fact that she ate the stuff and didn t get sick would buy again   she said it was quite tasty    disclaimer  author is not suggesting how you should store this item   use your own discretion and judgment  good gift  apparently tolerates not being refrigerated,1,0
1493,i absolutely love giving my two labrador retrievers elk antlers    they are the only chew that i have found that actually works and is not destroyed within a day or two  i was so pleasantly surprised when i saw that these two antlers were for  28  i bought them immediately  they arrived early this week  and upon opening the box   there was only one of them  the picture has has been shown  is showing two of them  same size but different color shape   i am confused as to how many i should have gotten  i kind of feel led on  even though  28 isn t bad for an  x large elk antler    my husband also measured this antler to be approximately the tip of the middle finger to the bottom on the hand  maybe i have just been spoiled  but to me that does not constitute as an  x large antler   regardless   i am very happy at how excited my puppies get  will continue to buy antlers  but may have to do a little more research  how many do you get   correct size   a bit confused   ,1,0
1494,i purchased these pods using amazon s subscribe and save program for the first time this year   the order was received promptly and the pods were fresh and very flavorful   i have used this flavor coffee pods since january 2007 and have not been disappointed ever   hopefully i will be able to continue receiving them from amazon  senseo paris coffee pods,1,0
1495,there s  7 i can spend on something else  i ve been using splenda since 2003 or so  this is the first i noticed a generic version  since i trust kirkland  i tried it  no more splenda for me  i paid 11 99 at costco 6 29 2012 for the 1500 pack  i shop amazon regularly and am a costco member  i was checking the price of splenda online and found this  had costco trip planned for the next day and sure enough  foung it there  just had it in my ceral and tea  i am very pleased  took the chance   paid off ,1,0
1496,smells good  tastes ok  but failed to rid my cankersores   no one likes cankersores and i read that this should cure them in a couple days  but it didn t work  ok tea,1,0
1480,based on the previous reviews  i tried these low carb tortillas and was not disappointed  i like to make my own salsa  but did not have chips and frankly  pork rinds do not cut it  these were great  i cut them into pie slices and fried them in a pan  some people have sprayed them with olive oil and baked them  i will try that next  i will be buying these again  makes great chips,1,0
1497,scampi flavor fries are not fries  but they are fried  and a delicious treat  they kinda smell gross  but the taste is very good  the treat is crispy  crunchy  light  and has a hollow center  i would definitely recommend this for hungry people like myself  smells gross  but tastes great,1,0
1499,i m always on the lookout for ways to cut calories without sacrificing flavor  so i jumped at the chance to try nectresse  in the past  artificial sweeteners have disappointed me with their fake flavor or icky aftertaste  especially stevia  gross   nectresse  so far  has struck just the right balance of natural flavor in my coffee and tea  pretty sweet,1,0
412,my dog is in love with this dog food  she won t even touch her other kind any longer  there are some ingredients that i m not thrilled about on the ingredients list  but there s not much i can do about that when almost all kinds of dog food have these ingredients  the biggest thing a dog food should be is edible to a dog and my dog loves this and as i can see from other reviews  there are tons of other dogs that love it  too  if you have a picky eater  you should try this food  my dog goes straight for it  the same way she would a treat  dog gives it two paws up ,1,0
1500,i have used these cakes for years and have never been disappointed in the number of different birds they attract  buying by the case with free shipping makes this a deal i cannot pass up  best buy,1,0
1501,i too am boycotting dog chews and treats not made in the us  so was nervous about ordering these   amazon needs to be very specific about this info in its descriptions  and not dance around the issue by leaving it out   country of origin should not be  optional  in terms of the descriptive information provided that being said  these are a huge hit with our big guys   they are a crunchy bisquit   not jerky   about 1 1 2  long by maybe 3 4  wide  but the first ingredient is organic chicken  package specifies  over 90  organic chicken    followed by organic brown rice  the product is certified usda organic    i am of the camp that  organic  means anything containing a carbon atom  and that aspect is not a big selling point for me  but may be desirable info for some    they are not inexpensive  but for a product made in the us and mostly chicken  i think it s in line with other pet treats  or less   i use them in combination with other  more grain containing treats  since too much protein can put a lot of strain on the kidneys  especially in older dogs bottom line   great product   this doggy mom approves  made in usa and the new favorite treat ,1,0
411,some people may find the whole idea of the  chef michael  line a little over the top  gourmet food for dogs  created by a top chef  to be honest  it isn t likely that we ever would have tried this product if i hadn t been sent a sample package for review our dog is an 80 pound mixed sharpei and great dane  and chef michael seems to be targeted more to smaller dogs  we would have to give our dog about eight cups a day  and that would get to be a much more costly proposition than his regular dry dog food  a generic brand  which we ve lately started mixing with purina beneful  which i ve reviewed separately  chef michael claims to have sirloin steak flavor with potato and green bean accompaniments  in fact  it is 26  beef  and the other items are there  but the mix contains quite a bit of filler  i just don t see the need to feed the dog much in the way of filler  or for that matter to pay for it certainly  the dog loves it and it serves  for us  as a great treat item rather than a mainstay of his diet  if you have a smaller dog  and don t mind the higher cost  this could be a regular meal item but a lot of the makeup of the product seems pitched to a human taste  the beef pieces  which are processed meat  are made up to look like little pieces of steak  complete with grill marks  that s nice  but do you think your dog will notice  will your dog recognize the potato and green bean accompaniments as he s enjoying his meal  our dog  frankly  just eats it  he loves it but i doubt that it s because there are faux grill marks on the beef pieces a comment on the packaging  it would have been nice if the package was resealable  and whoever came up with the photo on the front of the package really needs to go into another line of work  it makes the product look incredibly unappealing my bottom line is that this is a nice but ultimately unnecessary product  if you want to move up from generic dry dog food  try something like purina beneful instead  it s less expensive  less pretentious  and the dog eats it just as eagerly  good  if unnecessary,1,0
1502,these pasta shells of of good  not great quality   as long as price remains reasonable  they are worth the money main problem is the label and amazon  who relied on the copy from the manufacturer   says  large shells  these can only be called  small  so if you need large  for whatever reason  do not buy these   get  primo pasta  brand large shells   they are large and superb  but more expensive   taste ok  the name is misleading ,1,0
1503,the brush works well here in my country i didnt find something like that  it fills all my spectancies  thank you for the information sheat about the product good,1,0
410,our two dogs are not very picky eaters but when we first put this in their dishes they didn t stop until the bowls were empty  they even went to check each others bowls out to make sure they were empty  i read the ingredients list and was not too happy that there was so much  other  materials in the food  dogs loved it  but   ,1,0
1505,i love ordering whole bean coffee on amazon   i like this so much that this my first product review   i have to say that i m usually not a big fan of flavored coffee  but i thought i would give it a try   when my husband started grinding it up  i could smell it throughout the house   sometimes with flavored coffees  the smell is there but the taste isn t   however  not with this one   i m now going to order another flavor from this company and will give it a try  very good coffee,1,0
1506,how about this idea  even though we buy the non hydrogenated  natural  peanut butter  skippy  mainly   sometimes it is still separated so there is oil on the top  even though you can mix that oil back into the peanut butter  when you do the results are usually a fairly runny peanut butter unless you refrigerate it  or  you could drain the oil off  but that s such a waste  so  we like to mix in some of this powdered peanut butter to thicken those runny non hydrogenated peanut butters up  the flavor is never diluted  it is rich and delicious  how about this idea ,1,0
409,i have been using clear volumizing shampoo for a week   i love the way it makes my hair look   i have fine thin hair but the results have been great so far   i have only used it on my scalp roots as i am careful not too shampoo the rest of my long hair much because  any  shampoo makes my hair too flat   the smell is pleasing  the volume is comparable if not better than other shampoos   i can not yet comment on the strength or health of my hair but will check back in several weeks to do so   the shipping left much to be desired  the shampoo had some leakage   perhaps not the best bottle design  great results,1,0
1507,for taste  i love these   i also like that they do not add sugar or unhealthy fats these are covered in cocoa and a sugar substitute  not an icing like layer of chocolate  the only problem that affects me is the price  the price here at amazon is mediocre  i have seen better on sale prices in the grocery store  yummy  but expensive,1,0
1508,the product has a build in chamber that you can fill up simply by squeezing the bottle  there are also markings on the side to let you know how much so you can pour out exactly what is needed  but the problem is the container is not see through  nor can you see it while putting it up against the light  i even tried using a marker to mark the outside    still no luck  i m basically stuck using a measuring utensil of my own  smart idea    stupid execution     smart   but not so smart ,1,0
1509,i bought this ketchup because i was on atkins and wanted no carbs for a couple weeks  this ketchup has less carbs than the original and taste  in my opinion  the same  i would recommend it  heinz sugar free ketchup,1,0
1498,bought 2 cans to make japanese style cod roe spaghetti the cod roe is a little dry  light orange   not quite the pink i expected also it s not spicy at all so it s probably not the best ingredient for my recipe but if it is what you are looking for it s great  a little dry,1,0
416,a better version of appletiser  when first opened  a couple of drops were spilled on the lawn which was dissapointing  my friend then snatched it off me  and drank the lot   it was apparently better than appletiser  that ends my review  thankyou for reading really refreshing  if only import laws were less strict ,1,0
1479,these prunes  plums  are good part of the reason i bought this reason was that the  mariani family  produced them   on their farm the prunes come from turkey  not the us it seems that virtually all dried plumes come from turkey and that data is hidden in the small print when a company hides the truth i don t think highly of them i like the product   i don t like the  hiding  good but package may be misleading,1,0
1478,this is a very nice extract  tastes just like bubblegum when used properly  we use it to flavor meringue kisses and then reversed deep fried them in liquid nitrogen  bubblegum meringue ,1,0
427,this coffee tastes good and it is cheep at this price  i also bought french vanilla favor  which is terrible  tastes good ,1,0
1451,my local costco has them for  25 99   also  my local tax is 8  here in ca   that brings the total to  28 07 which is actually more expensive than the subscribe and save price here and i don t have to go borderline insane with cart rage at costco   but i understand that i may have a unique situation not having to pay taxes on amazon purchases but on local purchases i do   some may have no sales tax or may have to pay tax on amazon purchases   with the s s this is way better than the other option  imo   with that being said  it is an excellent bold coffee at a good price   there is a little bit of residue at the bottom of the coffee cup when i am done but nothing major   with some of the  make your own cups   i ended up with a gritty and terrible last drink which deterred me from wanting to use those things   i even bought a burr grinder in the hope that with a coarser grind i wouldn t get that but it still had a terrible last swig   with these  i don t dread that last drink and only notice a little residue on the bottom of my dried cup   these are now my  go to  for the keurig  good alternative to  k cup ,1,0
1452,i m not sure why it makes sense to put vitamins in a squeezable package  it reminds me of the 4 or 5 blade razors that are prevalent today  do we really need such technology  probably not  but if it helps you get your vitamins  i suppose it s not a bad thing  aside from the package design  the drink is fine and the concept of adding this to your other drinks is great  i never even thought to do this with my powder vitamin packages  the squeeze makes accurate portioning difficult  but all in all  this is a worthwhile buy  gratuitous industrial design for a good product,1,0
426,i have been purchasing things from amazon for a very long time   i have never felt the need to review anything  let alone when i buy it from somewhere else   however  i stopped in to my local walmart today  looking for something to accompany my 6 pack of wing dings   after coming off of memorial day weekend and going to a couple of barbecues i needed a break from chili   my coworker who accompanied me to grab lunch looked at me like i was an insane  but that did not sway me from grabbing the tamale s and heading back to the office   upon first bite  it was as though a small village in mexico had occupied my mouth during the cinco de mayo festival   i was expecting very little  but the gelatinous corn meal shell and suspect  beef  stayed true to the taco bell taste i have grown accustomed to   i gave this 5 stars  because in the can i got 5 tamales and only paid  1 50  lunch time special,1,0
425,but hard to find  i got this at walmart out of the refrigerator in front of the 20 items or less checkout stands  just because i was thirsty  it says it has spearmint and lemongrass in it  not sure if i taste either one  but normally i do not like bottled tea at all  i wasn t expecting much taste wise but i actually drank the whole bottle  and i am one of those people that never drinks a whole glass of anything  meanwhile everyone else has sucked down two glasses of tea and one of ice water i looked in the bottled tea section and apparently walmart doesn t carry it unrefrigerated  in another walmart it wasn t even in any of the refrigerators  it is so good that i will keep looking  delicious,1,0
1454,i ve  been a skippy creamy peanut butter consumer for many decades  and i decided to give planters creamy peanut butter a try to see whether it might be preferable  here are my observations 1  i was unable to differentiate the taste of the two products in admittedly unscientific taste comparisions  both  are a pinch  too sweet 2  ingredients   exactly the same  though the proportions are not specified  3  health  i m not a nutritionist  so i ll just quote a comparison per serving  2 tablespoons  from the two  products in the following categories  total fat  skippy  16 grams  planters  15 grams  sodium  both 150mg  saturated fat  skippy 3 grams  planters  2 5 grams 4  price  i was unable to make a reliable comparison on amazon com  had hoped there would be two competing offers for six  16 3 oz jars  but no such luck   i m going to check at my local  nyc  supermarket and see if there s a difference bottom line  i ll probably be guided by price  since in the other categories the differences were too minimal to be much of a consideration  a decent  everyday peanut butter,1,0
1455,i ve found this product at my local grocery store  i know that not all walden farms products taste good since they re zero calorie  i decided to try this based off all the positive reviews  it actually tastes pretty good  i wouldn t say it s as good as hershey s syrup but it s still good but if you want to try this product see if you can t find it at your local grocery store  i paid about 2 99 for it  the price on it s sold at on amazon is outrageous  good product but over priced,1,0
1456,my 2 month puppy had a weak cartilage and i was adviced to give her this product in a week her ear when up thta was amazing  people did not want to buy her because they thought it was a defect and now her cartilage is not weak it is better and i have so mnay people interested in my puppy thanks wonderful product for weak cartilage   awesome,1,0
423,seems great but it did leak out into the packaging   outside box was stained and oily   they need to put in plastic bag leaked,1,0
1458,i drank not even the whole bottle  maybe half   i fell asleep in a half hour  i don t understand how people take this and not fall asleep but it definitely knocks you out  knocked out ,1,0
1459,as some background  i should disclose that i regularly use splenda    most frequently in plain greek yogurt  either mixed in with some fruit or some other flavoring such as vanilla beans   in the past i have regularly used nutrasweet   i have tried stevia but i found that i did not like its aftertaste   i never warmed to saccharine because of its bad aftertaste  too   i have used splenda blends in baking with good results as well  though i seldom bake any sweets any more due to dietary reasons what i liked about nectresse was that it didn t seem to add any flavor to my yogurt beyond sweetness   i detected no aftertaste at all  and the sweetness itself was fairly mild   by comparison  the same amount of splenda  one packet per 8 ounces of yogurt  has a higher level of sweetness just to confirm my perceptions  i decided to taste both nectresse and splenda by themselves   in this taste test  i again found nectresse to have a slightly lower level of sweetness   nectresse looks a bit more like sugar    small grains versus fine white powder   beyond the different appearance and slightly different intensity level  the products were nearly identical in that they both taste clean with a hint of an aftertaste that is apparent when consumed alone but is masked when used as they normally would be    mixed with other ingredients i ll leave it to others to debate how natural this product is   in addition to the hyped monk fruit extract  it also contains erythritol  sugar  and molasses   in fact  erythritol is the first ingredient listed  so i assume that means that the product  by weight  contains more of that than the other ingredients   according to what i read online  erythritol is much less likely to cause intestinal discomfort than other sugar alcohols because it is largely absorbed in the small intestine   i ve never been bothered by any sugar alcohol in this regard  however  except on the lone unfortunate occasion when i consumed way too much sugar free chocolate and had a regretful afternoon  surprisingly neutral flavor with no aftertaste  but perhaps less sweet than some sugar substitutes,1,0
1460,tea is not the best quality  but good enough for chai   it professes to be an assam blendand i just couldn t taste it enough to tell   i have about a dozen assam estate varietiesat the moment  so it s not that i do not know what assam tastes like  the karha for this blend is a bit unique but flavorful in a pleasant way   the tea isjust background noise  not even a binder   ginger and cardamom were barely detectablein my box  the cinnamon was a spicy variety  like a saigon  not a warm variety  so itadds some bite   for those used to masala chai  the spice blend is a little differentthan some  and reminds me of eastern flavorings more than south or west   meaning cloveand cinnamon was the stronger of the flavors   if you re used to cardamom and pepperheavy chai  you will be disappointed this  cries for cream and sweetener   got for just a little half and half rather than amoderate dollop of milk  and a lighter honey  like wildflower  not buckwheat or the like over sugar  enjoy  spices more than tea,1,0
1461,there is a nice blend of flavours in this blend  it s always nice to sit and enjoy a cup of tea and ponder life s mysteries and this tea doesn t get in the way of that the strength is easily controlled by the length of time you let the bag steep each bag is individually sealed in its own packet so it won t go stale too quickly  not too strong  not too weak,1,0
1462,i was trying to emulate a particular coffee house drink when i purchased this syrup  however  this syrup did not suit that drink  i contacted the customer service at amoretti  and not only did they instruct me on how to create the drink i ve wanted  but they also sent me samples and other syrups to create it  the customer service is top notch  and i m very satisfied with my product    made amazing coffee ,1,0
1463,even though i m mexican  i do like to go eat at taco bell once in a while  chalupas mostly  anyway  when i saw this up for review i though it would be nice to have this around the flavor was really good  my brother and i liked it so much at first that we even used this sauce with tortilla chips  doritos etc as snacks  we used it up in about 1 week  but oh man  this sauce caused us a bit of stomach sickness  not because of spice or anything   its not spicy at all  but because it seems we abused of consuming this product  hence i warn any buyer to not abuse of this product i cant really describe the flavor  it was spicy  not in a hot way  and even felt it had a bit of bacon flavor to it  when i first tasted it it was love at first taste  i highly recommend it if not for tacos  at least for sauce on other snacks  good in small doses  great for snacks,1,0
1464,what a great purchase   i was originally looking for the ice coffee k cups but they are ridiculously expensive  i feel    after reading that their is not much of a difference and i was most concerned of the  watered down  taste so i thought and  extra bold  strength would do the trick  which it did     i will be buying more soon and in a larger quantity now that i know how well it works   p boston,1,0
422,i always keep one of these in my purse because i never know when i ll be out and about and want to sweeten a drink  i need to avoid sugar because i m dieting  i don t like saccharin  aspartame gives me headaches  and too many restaurants still don t offer sucralose in their artificial sweetener jar  not to mention i might be at a friend s house  it doesn t get used extremely often   i m not a perpetually dining out social butterfly   but i won t give it up  sugar free to go ,1,0
1477,the actual product is flavorful and goes down  easy   on a like for like basis  i would probably rate this as the best energy drink i have tried  versus the usual suspects     monster  etc    however  i am basing this assumption on my experience of drinking a flat product   the can was damaged and bloated on top  the shipping box was completely undamaged   so i wouldn t hesistate recommending trying out the drink from your local convenience store  but i would be wary of online orders based on my experience  who knows  probably is an isolated incident  but could be a packaging issue related to the new product    give it a shot  decent flavor  but damaged product,1,0
418,first you must have a sense machine i prefer this over the popular keurig because the plastic waste in that system is a shame the flavor is very good though not as dark roast as a sterbucks  which is a plus to me  my only concern is the viability of the product against the fierce competition also the cost is about  half of kcups  a pod for all seasons,1,0
419,i shudder to think what these are doing to my sons s stomach and esophagus  but he loves them  this order comes promptly  nothing is crushed  product seems to be fresh  just as it should be ,1,0
1475,the royal canine pd dog food is great  however  the food i ordered was supposed to be  royal canin veterinary diet canine hypoallergenic potatoe   duck dry dog food   but the food i received was just the regular royal canin potatoe   duck  7 7lbs dog food   shipping came to almost the same price as i would pay to get the 16lb bag of royal canin from the local petsmart  i haven t been able to find the  diet  food anywhere and i was excited to find it on amazon  but    little disappointed  okay  but   ,1,0
1474,i recently moved to a region where it is hard to find a lot of items to which i had become accustomed in the mid atlantic   san marzano tomatoes are nowhere to be found   i ordered these because they were attractively priced and seemed authentic   they did not disappoint   they are equally good in pasta sauce as they are on pizza  the cans are small  which is also a plus since sometimes i ve found i cannot use all of the tomatoes in the much larger cans   do not overanalyze this purchase   if you are looking for flavorful  low acid tomatoes that don t taste like tin  buy these  good price  great tomatoes,1,0
420,i m not a coffee drinker  but i thought i d give this a try since i like caramel lattes on occasion  once i ve added 1 2   1 2 plus a little sugar it has a good taste and a good balance of coffee creamer sugar to make it not sicky sweet like the barrista s version  but not to bitter which is why i don t like coffee  not a coffee drinker ,1,0
1510,you haven t tried this honey   are you uninformed or just a coward there is nothing like the texture and taste of this honey go on    get it even the honey allergens are not effective  if  indeed there is any    i would be affectedif they were they are not and i can totally enjoy this also no lingering  honey burn  for the throat  what      ,1,0
1472,got a smaller size than 3 pound pack from fisherman s fleet  put in the freezer  defrosted today and opened the bag  sweet and fresh  no rancid fishy smell  was very nice baked  fresh smell and taste,1,0
1470,this one was a little too sweet strong for me  i think the other reviewer s reaction was very strong  but i can understand it  i actually ended up using this in a smoothie instead of juice  which was good because it added a hint of the vanilla taste  and i still got all of the benefits  if i m thirsty  i would probably go for the mojito karmalife coconut water  mojito green tea  made with real green tea   12 oz glass bottles  pack of 6  but this was definitely a good option for the smoothie kinda sweet,1,0
1469,i m always in the market for new product that will add volume without weight to my not so fine fine hair   after reading multiple reviews on this shampoo  i was a little worried that i was in for yet another disappointing  weighted down hair experience   what a pleasure then to note on first use that it not only supplied more body but was helpful in controlling those unfortunate waves that develop with age i think this shampoo builds up over time  i get good results with occasional use  but regular use makes for a sorry  drowned rat effect  interesting though  while humidity  of which we have little here in denver  is my hair s worst enemy  rain on a clear scalp shampoo day did not raise that dreaded halo of frizz  mixed results for fine  thin hair,1,0
1468,i had read another review and the reviewer was concerned about this product coming from china   i called the manufacturer and was told this product is made here in the us   my dog loves them   made in the usa,1,0
1467,why is it so hard to find mars bars in grocery stores these days   do they just not ship to southeast pennsylvania anymore   am i shopping in all the wrong places   they used to be really popular 20 years ago   you d walk in and there they d be right next to the snickers and 5th avenue bars  but now    i guess they re being pushed to the side for other candy bars   this is an outrage   i m not paying more than 5 bucks for a few candy bars either  why why why ,1,0
421,you will not find a better loose green tea for the price   i was able to get free shipping as well since i bought it with something else that totaled over  25   this is the tea used by many japanese people   do not fall for those high priced  organic  green teas produced by american companies   they are good   but you are not getting anything better than hime ban cha tea  great price great quality ,1,0
1465,when i was a grad student  the father of one of our friends was a connoisseur of fine spirits and liqueurs   he introduced us to a number of wonderful products  many of which were the rums distilled by lemon hart  most of the rums distilled by lemon hart are jamaica rums   demerara rum  however  is from a special variety of guyana sugar cane   the rum distilled from this cane has a burnt  caramelized taste that is very distinctive   we usually drank demerera rum straight  thought i suppose that it might also go with well with a little water and ice the flavor of demerara is too strong for it to be a good mixer   one of the few mixed drinks that we ever attempted with demerara was called  the quarterdeck number 2  in trader vick s book of mixed drink recipes   the quarterdeck consists of rum and sherry  but demerera tends to even overwhelm the sherry our other favorite rum drink was hot buttered rum  a drink that we had so often on cold winter nights that we came to refer it as  hbr    the recipe in trader vick s for hbr was too sweet for our taste   instead  we favored a recipe for  hot buttered comfort  that i found in a southern comfort magazine add   in our version  you put a shot of dark jamaican rum and a cinnamon stick in a coffee cup  almost fill the cup with boiling hot water  then place a pat of butter on the top   demerara rum was not generally the rum that i favored for hbr  though sometimes i was in the mood for it   i should note lemon hart s dark jamican rums are better suited to hbr and other mixed drinks  a distinct and caramelized taste,1,0
1471,ok  i ve read a lot of people complain about this product  not knowing what the heck they re talking about   i have the truth  with proof  about this particular brand of canned tomato first off  if you know how strict the laws are about wine in france  then the same applies with italians and their tomatoes   if they are not  dop  certified  and grown in san marzano sul sarno  italy  then by law they are not allowed to be called san marzano tomatoes which now brings me to this product   yes  the brand name is actually san marzano  however  they are not grown nor imported in from italy   but  and it s a huge but   they are actually san marzano tomatoes    how can this be    you ask   well  they are grown from san marzano tomato seeds   ahh haaa   they are locally grown in the us  in the same conditions as san marzano sul sarno  italy with san marzano tomato seeds   probably the closest thing you will find to the real thing  without the cost i found a website that backs up my info  and also rates every kind of canned san marzano tomato   here is an excerpt of this brand  this domestic san marzano product has been cultivated in the usa using the same variety of seed used in san marzano  italy  which produces a tomato that is deep red  firm and meaty  and with very few seeds  if you want to find the website i m talking about  do a search for  san marzano tomatoes brands   companies  and click on the first link  sorry  amazon won t let me link to them directly   you might learn something about this great product there you have it   they never lied  they didn t mislead  they are true to there brand  literally  ha   you re welcome  alright people   you want the truth   read on   ,1,0

408,i have been buying dog food  for id say probably 20 years  and for the most part i didnt know the full extent of the crap i was feeding my dog  i used to buy anything id find at the local grocery store  turns out the stuff is bad for them  i believe the vet bills confirmed this  since i made the switch to instinct my beagles have been doing much better  one is just turning 15 and has basically turned back the clock  when it comes to dog food you really do get what you pay for  simply the best ,1,0

391,its pricey  true  but after trying over a dozen other lower priced teas  and others that were only lower because of a pre purchased certificate  i decided it was less expensive just to buy what i wanted than try to save   if i didnt think it was a good value in the long run  i would have had to go with 4 not 5 stars  no matter how much i love it   but it earns that last star when you get down to it   i first tasted this at a mall walking by a teavana shop i was so dazed that this was a tea i was tasting   it just didnt seem real   i didnt buy any that day  and kept hurrying to my destinatation   later i couldnt get it out of my head  and finally went back to be sure  and to buy it then i went shopping around   i can usually find things for waaaay below retail  without sacrificing quality   but not with this   i wasted a couple of hundred dollars on less expensive blends with no luck   eventually i found one that was a close second   but the same was true in price    other than a prepaid half off certificate i had for that store i was almost  enchanted  by the runner up   but once i tried the teavana again  the other just wasnt in the same district   it was just too floral   the teavana tea is more delicate and balanced  if i ever find a deal like that again  i ll try the other tea for use in blending with the distant third place winners   if even the youthberry is a bit floral for you  tevana sells a lighter blended version with orange but for me   by itself in the youthberry  you taste each flavor as a separate note  fruity  warm  then aromatically fragrant  i know they say taste is mostly smell   i actually smell the roses more than taste them    then at either the beginning or the end of the sip  or so i found  varying by whether hot or cold  may not be there at all for you  there is a brief moment when the notes make a chord or perhaps symphony   all too short  leaving you wanting more  but at the same time  perfectly filled if i sound like i m reviewing a wine    i have had that pleasure  and i think out of the hundreds of wines i tried  including most of the wines considered among the finest  i never enjoyed a wine more than this tea for flavor   and at almost no calories then again  once i had to pay for the wines myself  for some reason my love for them waned  this tea is one of the few things i think is worth paying retail for if you hate all things floral  including the scent of flowers  perfume etc   this isnt for you   i dont know many who do  other than allergically this is like drinking a cup of sweet fruit tea while visiting a fine florist   sitting in a garden  or holding a rose   but somehow it isnt girly  unless you want it to be   i just found something totally new and different for me when i tasted it  and it was an unexpected pleasure that brought me into the tea afficiando world like never before   i only like herbals i make myself usually oh the other two of my 4  had nothing in common with this  were just herbals i picked up to qualify for free shipping in hopes of finding something i could tolerate that had the benefit of some of the herbs within   i actually found two i like for two things i knew i should either drink or eat  but hated the taste the youthberry may have beneficial things in it    in fact it does  or so my herbal books say of the ingredients  but its a drink for pure pleasure   i recently had to give up all forms of soda  diet or not  and was using tea for a flavor substitute   it didnt really do the job  until i found this   i like it better than the soda and dont miss it at all now   i really only switch out from the youthberry for plain water  or something i need the benefit of  and to cleanse my taste buds to go back to this   leaves easily yeild two batches of water  i find that adding only about 25  as much i can stretch that to 4 or 5   in the long run  i m actually saving money vs soda  never knew a tea could taste this good,1,0
1544,these are soft and almost melt in your mouth  they taste like fruit too  i think these are great  not too sweet  not unsweet either  the problem however is they are not vegetarian  if you read the ingredients on back you see that they contain bovine  cow  gelatin  it s sort of sick  but they do taste good  dericious,1,0
1545,i purchased a bag of the back to nature california almonds in the green wise section of my local publix   they were a bit pricey  but they are certainly worth it the nuts are raw and have therefore not been roasted or salted  the nuts were is excellent condition  very few broken pieces with the exception of those broken during my trip from market to home the 11 oz  package was filled with whole almonds   the package was also easy to open and easy to reseal for freshness the nuts were super fresh and super tasty  the package contains about 11 servings  1 oz   24 nuts  each serving is 160 cal   14 g fat  1 g sat  fat  3 5 g poly fat  9 g mono fat  200 mg potassium  6 g carbs  3 g fiber  and 1 g sugar the nuts are 100  natural california almonds that contain no artificial perservatives or artificial ingredients   the nuts are distributed by the back to nature food company in madison  wi the package offers an expiration date   a clear warning for parents  and a safety website   do not give nuts to children under 6  chocking hazard  back to nature california almonds unroasted   unsalted   11 oz ,1,0
1546,when i was little  i had no idea how to say these things   pul  pulpo  pu pu     so i just call them poo poo candy and how fitting the moniker  looks like poo poo  but tastes like god s breast milk  i would imagine that s what it would taste like  and also gives you the runs after over consumption  these are good  if you need to try exotic stuff this year  put this on your list  yes  poo poo candy ftw ,1,0
1547,if you cant deduce the jist of my review based on the title  stop reading now because you never will  this is a totally personal thing  i just  honestly do not like this as much as other coffees ive tried   theres nothing wrong with it  i recieved what i ordered  it was delievered promptly  i just dont really care for the taste  if you know what this tastes like and enjoy it  buy it   i prefer donut shop   but to each his own  this cat is bold like it   dont love it,1,0

1550,i like the dove products for men  this product does not dry out my skin  smells fine  and works well   i paid for 3 bottles of item   the packaging was poor and one bottle broke open spilling most of it s contents   i was able to recover about 25  of the third bottle  the bottles were placed in a plastic bag with no other padding  i e  anything to keep the bottles from getting damaged   no air bags  no peanuts  nothing at all for protection   at this point  sending them all back is not an option  product is great but packaging was terrible,1,0
389,it doesn t taste great  but it doesn t taste horribly bad either  you can get used to it  but there s no substitute yet for the taste of regular sugar   if you want to lose weight and feel cutting out sugar is key to your strategy  this seems to be the best option so far  sweetleaf steviaclear liquid stevia,1,0
388,as someone who already enjoys mini wheats  i was eager to try the cinnamon rolls flavor and while i have no problem with the regular flavor  this is a good change of pace of flavor   while i would not say it tasted like cinnamon rolls  it did remind me of cinnamon toast crunch a bit   as with regular mini wheats it was still sweet  but not too sweet  so this is by no means an old fashioned sugary kids cereal  front mini wheats with a brand new kick ,1,0

387,i chew this gum pretty much constantly  occasionally other stride flavours too  but i prefer this one   just the right blend of mild sweetness and mint   i take a prescription that makes me really nauseous and sensitive to smells  and chewing gum helps to combat that  i ve tried a ton of different brands  and so far  this is the only one that doesn t give me horrible cramps  i suspect it s because most other sugar free gums contain maltitol  but anyway  stride s the only kind of gum i ll buy  particularly this kind as some reviewers have pointed out  if you order this on here either via subscribe   save or as a single order  you ll still get the stride 2 0 version  not the original sweet peppermint  rip  and they really should change the photo   it s not as good as the original was  but it s still a pretty decent flavour and just as long lasting  the sweetness does sort of wear off  after a while  and it becomes a bit bitter  but if you re like me and like bitter stuff  it s all for the better    stride 2 0,1,0

385,i don t know about you but my husband was really impressed with the smell   but i checked it and it does smell like steak small kibble mixed with a larger kibble that i m assuming is the source of the steak smell   and possibly taste    i didn t try it  all three of my dogs loved it and were looking for more guess i ll be buying more     but maybe save it for special occasions when we have steak thank you mef actually smells like steak,1,0

1559,i wonder if the other reviewer has gotten old tea  that would cause it to lose flavor  while this is certainly not what anyone would consider a  quality  tea  and it doesn t have  as the other reviewer mentions  a traditional russian tea flavor  if you want a strong black loose tea at a really good price this is worth it  i usually drink it when i need that caffeine pick me up  not when i want a flavorful tea experience  for that go green  not so bad,1,0

1561,dr  schar s bread is delicious  especially since they upgraded the texture   i understand that they are now building a baking facility in the us   i guess most of their products  if not all  were coming from europe     what i don t like are the prices being charged online   if one of our somewhat local walmarts have the bread  it is about  5    i think there is another supermarket that carries it for about the same price   online prices can be as much as  7 50 loaf   ridiculous   a lot of us who must eat gf food are also dealing with major medical costs associated with the diseases that force us to go gf   i will never pay the exorbitant prices  great product  bad price,1,0

382,i used this exact brand of dha during my first pregnancy and now again on my second pregnancy  i specifically chose this brand because of the source of dha  algal oil  which claims to result in much less fishy taste burping   i haven t had any bloating  gas  or burping issues as a result of taking this supplement   i would definitely recommend this product to others the only complaint i have is the way in which amazon com packed and delivered the product  i live in california and the day it was delivered it was 90f and probably much hotter in my mailbox  the heat caused all the gel pills to stick together making it frustrating to pull apart and take a pill each day   i contacted amazon com about the poor shipping conditions and that it should be ice packed  but never heard back   i hope my next subscribe and save shipment doesn t arrive like the last bottle did  no fishy burp at all,1,0

1554,the bottle for this shampoo has an opening that you lever up when you want to put shampoo on your hair   the problem is that it also levers up easily during shipping  meaning the bottle is covered with shampoo when it arrives   amazon did wrap the bottle in a plastic bag to limit the damage  but the manufacturer should really design a bottle that doesn t leak  or at least seal the top with plastic tape clear scalp   hair therapy has a strong  lingering fruity scent  whether you like it will be a matter of taste  i color my hair  and i was hoping that a  damage and color repair  shampoo would do a good job of preserving color  i can t speak to the damage repair part  but it s not a very good color preserving shampoo  i would recommend it for someone with average  uncolored hair  badly designed bottle  ok shampoo for uncolored hair,1,0
392,i m not a fan of the milky  sugary  chai tea  that you get in coffee houses  but i do like all of the spices that go into masala chai    fyi   according to wikipedia  the word  chai  means  tea    masala chai refers to the spiced tea    chai tea  means  tea tea     this particular version of masala chai contains assam black tea  that s from india   cinnamon  cardamon  ginger  cloves  and  natural flavors    i m not sure what those  natural flavors  are  but i like the other ones    ok  to be honest  i m not sure what plain cardamon tastes like  but i frequently put cinnamon and cloves in my plain tea  and the cardamon doesn t seem to be screwing up the flavor of this tea  i steeped the tea for 3 minutes   it tasted fine  but it tasted a little better with about a quarter teaspoon of sweetener   that punched up the cinnamon  ginger  and clove flavors  and probably the cardamon s too  without making it sweet as of this writing  you can get 6 boxes of this for  18 on subscribe   save   this is definitely worth  3 for a box of 20   this has a lot of flavor without tasting like kool aid  tastes pretty good ,1,0

1513,not a treat for anyone who is sensitive or allergic to gluten  the first two ingredients are wheat flour and wheat glucose syrup   my wife was soooo disappointed when i told her the rest of the bag was hers   that being said this is a soft  chewy licorice with a definite molasses undertone  i find the combination of flavors interesting  not my choice of an  everyday  licorice but i m keeping this one on my food wishlist nb   the packaging is confusing but within amazon s disclaimer  whatever it is  it s not our problem   sweet gourmet apparently buys kookaburra australian black licorice in bulk then sells it in  store brand  packaging  this seems to have upset some other reviewers but there re no conspiracies here  just business  also note the company s web address is simply  lt       contains wheat ingredients,1,0

1520,i wouldn t pay the price for shipping this but wouldn t turn one down if offered  i m surprised at some of the bad reviews but wonder if they were stored in the heat and went bad  i liked that it wasn t as sweet as say somestarbuck s products since i don t take regular coffee with any sweeteners  a nice treat,1,0
401,while i did not buy this item online i did buy it at a local shop while out and about a few months back   i see a lot of negative reviews about this product from people who claim to have followed the directions of just went ahead and immediately put the packet in a planter   peppers can be tricky to grow and with this particular setup  i ve purchased the various other  magic  plant s over the years and never had a bad one  you have to understand that these are not native to the america s so the growing conditions need to be taken into consideration   it says on the package itself to rest the item in 50  sunlight  meaning to put it on a windowsill where you don t get much direct sunlight through   my bedroom only receives direct light until about 10 00a m   and then when the plant has grown large enough to transfer it into direct sunlight   my particular pack had 4 sprouts come out  higher than normal  and i transplanted them early and lost two of them to the sun   the other two are growing fine in a planter where i eagerly await my ghost chili s to improve my hot sauce recipes   if you really follow the directions and know just a little about gardening this will grow for you   if you look for the seeds you will not find them as pepper seeds can be very small and blend in well with planting material  not for everyone ,1,0
1522,i ordered this with the hopes of creating an effect on cookies and i was not disappointed   this product was fantastic   i had previously gotten a similiar product that basically did not come close to doing what it was suppose to do and ended up having to re do the order   i wish i had found this first   i love it and would definitely order again  fantastic ,1,0

400,this is definitely an oatmeal cereal  i did not like the little squares at first  maybe it was because it reminded me of another product  however once this got into the mouth that little prejudice vanished i went back to the box again an again  this is filling without feeling stuffed  worth the try,1,0
1524,all candy is bad for you  but if you must seek to destroy yourself  elevate your blood sugar  your blood pressure  licorice  real licorice does this   and pack on some fat  then choose this salty non corn syrup confection from holland and leave those plastic twizzlers on the shelf where they belong  katjes salzige heringe  salty hering   fish  200g if you must eat licorice   try this,1,0
1525,a strange taste  kind of like relish and jelly   not so good on toast but really good on ham and cheese melt  strange but good,1,0
1538,i received the clear scalp and hair beauty conditioner and have used it several times recently   i think the conditioner is too much for my hair  which is color treated and very fine   i think what i need is a shampoo and conditioner to add volume   this is not the conditioner for me  but i would recommend it for those who have dry hair or thick hair  almost too nourishing    ,1,0
393,my very picky and spoiled rotten  furr people  loved this    i can t be more happy with this product thank you for thinking before you present a  food  meant for canines   i am over 50 years old and have yetto see starving wolves and the like grazing in a corn field   corn is so bad for our beloved   family members and should be outlawed for adding to any so called  complete nutrition      aka   dog food  newmans own rock s   as does any vendor whom sells their products  doggy crack ,1,0
1536,although these  flops  failed jelly belly standards  they still taste great and get a passing grade from me   our family enjoyed them considerably   it was fun to pick out different jelly bellys and guess their flavors by looking at their colors before tasting  the quality was still great with these flops  jelly flops earn an  a  in my tastebud book,1,0
394,i took advantage of the 50  off special last summer to try some new to me products  including 4 flavors of these sesame seeds  and loved all of them  garlic can easily overpower other flavors in a dish  but these strike a nice balance between too weak to taste and too strong to taste anything else  i ve used them in several savory dishes and was delighted  not overpowering garlic taste,1,0
1535,obviously  strawberry milk is not a health food  especially when you make it with whole milk like i do  that being said  the nesquik powders are a much better option for me than the syrups because they are sweetened with sugar and not hfcs  high fructose corn syrup  which gives me intense  sharp stomach pains  i can have a glass of strawberry milk when i have to skip meals just to have something to hold me over or when i need to take a medication which requires food or milk  and i can do it without the stomach issues  i like both the strawberry and chocolate powders  strawberry milk mix made with sugar  no hfcs ,1,0
1533,this is a soup that you would order in a good restaurant and pay big bucks  this soup is mlld but zesty  creamy but not too mush  has texture and when you finish eating you want more  this is a big step up to  progresso brand  chicken cheese enchilada flavor  indulges my senses  indulgence,1,0

1530,first of all  i won t be buying the  regular  size sunflower seeds again  only the jumbo sized seeds   the little ones are too much work and too little reward   the flavor of these dill sunflower seeds reminds me of a dill pickle and i don t get a sore mouth from the excessive salt additives  as i do with david brand sunflower seeds   the jumbo brand seeds are fresh and i don t get loads of broken empty shells in the packages   anyway  i do recommend these over the david brand of sunflower seeds  good flavor and not too much salt,1,0
1528,  see update below  first  i want to say that in general i very much like the san francisco bay  one cup  coffee products   their fog chaser and rain forest blends are two of my favorite k cups   as has been mentioned in many other reviews  they don t look like  normal  k cups  but they work in keurig brewers   never had any problems with the brand or the innovative cup design i also like amazon s frustration free packaging option   between that and the reduced plastic in the cup itself  this is a good less waste alternative  and the price is great however   i really don t care for this particular french roast variety   i m not especially picky about coffee   i like a variety of brands  roast styles  and flavors   specifically  i tend to prefer  dark  and  extra bold  k cups   but this particular french roast just doesn t work for me   some of the cups have been worse than others  but i find the coffee to be especially bitter  with a very distasteful burned flavor   with most coffee  i can enjoy it black  but i usually add just a little bit of cream and sugar   for this variety  i have to add an extra slug of cream  which balance out the bitterness just enough to be  ok    with this amendment  they re not quite bad enough to throw away  but i definitely won t be purchasing more to summarize  sf bay k cups are great   if you stick to the non french roast varieties   update  after receiving the prompt comment on this review from sfbay s customer service  i gave them a call   i immediately talked to a real person at the company  not some random call center   who was very helpful and communicated clearly   this helpful rep was primarily focused on making me happy with their coffee  and to that end  he sent me three replacement bags of different varieties  which i knew i liked  at no cost   i ve tried those and  as usual  they re excellent   he was also concerned that there might be something wrong with the batch or roast that i had received  and provided me with a pre paid label to return the old coffee so they could test it so i m still not sure whether i got a bad batch  or whether i just don t like this flavor   hence my 4 5 stars   but either way  with customer service of this caliber  it s definitely worth trying the coffee   highly recommended   my review was therefore changed from 2 stars to 4  good almost k cup concept  don t like this flavor,1,0
399,previously had k cups in boxes they came in  now i have a attractive way of storing k cups out of way near coffee maker  space saver,1,0
1527,i love these bags  price and quality does matter when it comes to some products  i actually use these for my kitty litter box  and had bought some really cheap ones at the grocery store  they were tiny and really thin  i ordered these and they were great  they were a lot longer and thicker  and the fact that they are scented is a plus    they re a little pricey  but i think they re worth it  and i never smell anything when i throw the bags in the garbage  give them a try  you won t be disappointed  love these ,1,0
1526,not a big fan of the blueberry  but the rest of the flavors were good   i will probably just order the vanilla caramel creme next time   this is a good bundle if you are looking to try something new   good for trying new flavors ,1,0
395,this coffee has a pleasant taste  not bitter  not weak  this isn t a very special coffee  but definitely worth drinking  good brew,1,0
533,i ordered this product to try and got it today  it leaked out of the bottle but at least the packaging smelled nice  i gave it a try and oh i should mention  i have super sensitive skin and this product does not irritate it  i used it with the matching shampoo and together they made my hair feel really soft and like i said not irritated which is huge  i have to be very careful what products i use and the scent is pleasant  not too powerful  smells nice  hair feels soft,1,0
1214,nothing is seriously wrong with these farmed oyster pieces from south korea  there are no inclusions of sand or shell fragments  just as clams are an extremely  extremely rich source of iron  oysters are an extremely  extremely rich source of zinc  the only problem might be that these oyster pieces are slightly less delicious than some brands of canned whole oysters  the reason might be that it is quite normal for whole oysters to be slightly better tasting than oyster pieces   like most farmed oysters from south korea  these oyster pieces are lighter in color than the darker colored farmed oysters from china   unlike smoked oysters  which are high in cancer causing nitrosamines and cancer causing heterocyclic amines  these oyster pieces are quite good for your health  oysters are extremely low in mercury and other marine pollutants and moderately high in the long chain omega 3 fatty acids  epa and dha  no inclusions of sand or shell fragments,1,0
1213,my dogs  and cats  love this product   i ve been using it for years   just recently  though i ve read reviews about the chicken strips from china causing animals to get sick  so although none of my pets have had problems  i ve decided not to purchase this type of product anymore  just to be on the safe side  my dogs love this ,1,0
869,i confess that i didn t use the recipe on the box  i threw it into a crockpot with some chicken and other stuff  turned out great though  not too spicy  not a thick  starch like consistency  and it stuck to the food instead of draining off of it  into a pool on the plate  tasty ,1,0
870,i didn t expect these packages to be so small  but i do like the chips   they have a lovely flavor  different from any i had eaten before   i would buy these again to have on hand when i am compelled to eat a salty snack  a wonderful salty snack,1,0
871,this is the best  should go for around  3 50 per jar  8 5 oz   i dont know if its the asian community or whatbut the shipping price is outrageous  i thought i would order a few extra jars to offset the high shipping costand shipping increased big time  when i added more jars  all the other available sellers shipping price did the same  its a 5 star product with a 1 star management behind it they ship nuclear waste  cheaper than this     just kidding  great item overpriced shipping,1,0
872,i purchased this product as i liked the all in one formulation and was inspired by others  comments about how it has successfully snatched their flora back from almost certain demise   i haven t been disappointed   i live in a shady area  but decided to try my hand at growing some potted herbs outdoors  basil  cilantro  catnip  catmint    even with the limited amount of sun  the herbs are robust with the addition of this product   true to other reviews  it also saved my droopy looking fuchsia which i thought i would lose   in short  i d definitely recommend this product  all purpose plant food,1,0
873,my wife and i have been looking for a box of inexpensive shabbat candles   our local shul didn t have these neriot candles and other places online charged as much for shipping as the cost for the candles these were a great deal  4 boxes here for the price of 2 elsewhere  plus free prime shipping   they arrived quickly and the box we opened look good   no noticeable broken candles or other damages   the boxes look a little different from the photo  but the brand is called  menora   the candles word  with a po box from tel aviv  which i assume is where these were made since it doesnt list any place of manufacture   the box lists the candles as kosher you need to burn these in a special glass  and we haven t lit any of these to confirm the 4 hour estimate  but will report back if the time is much less than 4 hours so far  very glad to have found these on amazon   4 boxes will last us at least a year  probably 2  good deal,1,0
874,effective but has killed several birds and squirrels  i wonder if a  pulsed  charge would be non lethal     perimeter should also be frequently inspected for shorts  limbs  grass  dead squirrels  as they render the downstream wire dead   check using a voltmeter at the end of the line to the dirt or a ground source  garden pest deterrent,1,0
652,dizzy pig makes a number of fine rubs  their  dizzy dust  is full flavored  not too salty  and perfect for pork ribs  boston butt  and pork tenderloin   i love this stuff for port  but not for beef  it is not spicey  so if you want a kick  you could had some type of pepper  full flavored  not too salty ,1,0
876,taste wise  vitamin squeeze is on par with crystal light except that crystal light gives you a pre measured dose while vitamin squeeze allows you to determine the strength of your drink unlike crystal light  vitamin squeeze does have additional vitamins   a healthy dose of vitamin c  which is suppose to give you a burst of energy   however  i have not noticed the promised energy burst after finishing my vitamin drink if you typically use products that you add to water  vitamin squeeze is a product to try   the fruit punch flavor tastes fruity but does have a hint of sucralose   i prefer vitamin squeeze over the mio products  on par with crystal light  but has vitamins added  did not notice the promised burst of energy,1,0
877,i have been using anti dandruff shampoo for quite some time   when the symptom is severe  i use head   shoulders clinical strength anti dandruff shampoo 14 2 fluid ounce  pack of 2  which contains 1  selenium sulfide   for normal maintenance i usually use regular head   shoulders ocean lift dandruff shampoo  23 7 fluid ounce  pack of 2  which is less strong   comparing to other regular shampoo  the head   shoulders anti dandruff shampoo does not smell as good  and is not as smooth feeling this new clear men scalp therapy 2 in 1 anti dandruff shampoo and conditioner contains the same active ingredient as the regular head and shoulders shampoo  1  pyrithione zinc    however it is formulated to be really smooth   just a tiny drop can produce a lot of form for shampooing   it also smells better in my opinion than head   shoulders   after using it for a couple of weeks  i think the anti dandruff effectiveness is the same as head   shoulders if not better this shampoo also claims to have essences from herbs such as ginseng  tea tree and others   i do not doubt the claim but perhaps the concentration is just not enough for me to identify from the smell   anyway that s not important for me this shampoo is for you if you use head   shoulders and want to try something for a change  an anti dandruff shampoo that works well,1,0
651,this is not what i would normally feed weanng kittens but    when i put  mama s  food down and then their expensive kitten food   5 of the 6 went straght for the friskies turkey bits  i opened another can and put it on a plate and  smooshed  it up with a fork   the meat in it was so tender that it did not take any effort at all  the kitties are almost seven weeks now and getting ready for new homes   in their goodie bag there will be a couple of cans of friskies turkey dinner  kittens love friskies turkey filet dinner,1,0
879,my dog absolutely loves these things  i tried to switch brands and i bought one that was made in usa  bc of what i ve heard about made in china products   but he wouldn t touch them  lol i ended up buying the big ole bag of these  he is a very happy doggie right now  lol  delivery was quick  also  i didn t realize how much money i was dishing out for the extra small bag  it pays to buy big  i had to buy a big bag,1,0
650,this bread is yummy   i baked my first loaf in my bread machine today   it came out excellent   firm and tasty   the mix makes a 2 lb  loaf   it is firm  no air holes   i set my bread machine on quick bread setting and medium darkness   if someone served me a piece of this bread and didn t tell me it was gluten free  i wouldn t have known it   i was buying walmart s schar gluten free bread and i couldn t eat it unless it was toasted   it was that bad tasting  plus is was  6 00 a loaf   try it you will like it what happened the price went up and the subscribe and save is gone   i just bought a box of the same mix at walmart for  4 60   guess i will be buying the bread mix elsewhere  i am impressed by the taste of this bread,1,0
880,i too got a bottle that leaked in transit   but at least it was well bagged and didn t make a mess the shampoo seems to work well   i have not had any dandruff since i started using it   the scent if nice  but not too strong   and the bottle is easy to use i don t feel any  cool tingling  but i am not really disappointed by that  works,1,0
881,my cats think this treat is the best thing since   well  salmon   i like the fact that it s not messy and there are no bigger pieces to break off and flake everywhere   they are just the right bite size for my boys   and it s just salmon and nothing but salmon   no additives   i just wish it wasn t made in china   hopefully  cat man doo pays close attention to they way they are processed   i will definitely continue buying these for my furry fellas  cats go bonkers for this ,1,0
868,this is my all time favorite dressing but it s very hard to find a grocery store that carries it  usually  fat free  salad dressing means a tasteless thin  runny liquid that has too much salt  vinegar or sugar  this dressing has a full bodied tomato taste  not at all like a fat free product  a great fat free salad dressing,1,0
882,we have a dane who prefers the small iams  however  being 180 lbs   she can really put them away  and they don t sell these biscuits in our town  you have to drive for hours   my only concern was whether or not the biscuits would grow stale   in a month s time  they still seem fresh    i recommend carefully storing these in plastic containers and picking out the broken ones and feeding those first   don t freeze  they ll get soggy   best value on the market for iams,1,0
884,these were truly a joy to eat  extremely tasty  something you actually enjoy eating as opposed to sardines which just aren t so delicious that said  i didn t notice how much salt is in them until after i finished eating  there are 3 5 servings in the 6 7oz can and 280mg of salt per serving  listed as 10  of daily value  for just one serving    i ate almost the whole can  but i was hungry and they were tasty     i wouldn t care so much  but it s not sea salt   and even if it was  that s probably more salt than necessary  it s probably iodized sodium chloride  table salt   heavily processed and chemically stripped of all minerals i allow canned fish in my diet because it is a good way to get omega 3 s  especially while traveling or camping  but i am not so comfortable with the fact that the fish  while in the can  is brought to such high temperatures that it is considered sterile  omega 3 fats are delicate  better to eat fish high in omega 3 s raw  fermented  lightly seared  etc  also concerned about leaching of the metal can  i only buy in water because i don t want to eat olive oil that has been so highly heated  it would be full of oxidized fat  but then again  maybe so is the fish after being canned  i am not so concerned with getting bpa free cans   they may take the bpa out and put in something just as bad or worse    a different bisphenol  i read someone saying the bpa was actually what kept the metals from leaching into the food  i think it was just their speculation based on tasting a metallic taste in a bpa free canned food  but it seems to me that could be the case so what s worse  possible metals  bisphenol  and oxidized fats  or do the boost of omega 3 fats and protein  convenience  low cost  and lowest mercury content of any other fish outweigh these issues   pcbs  dioxins are another matter and their levels depend where the fish come from  you must consider how much bisphenol  leaching metals  and oxidized fats you are getting in your diet already  and decide for yourself  you may want to get rid of all the other possible sources of these things and just allow yourself canned fish every once in a while ideally i would like to see on the can where the fish comes from and whether it is sustainably harvested  i also prefer spring water and sea salt or no salt the wood smoking is another point of contention  because it forms carcinogenic compounds  however  wood smoking was done traditionally in healthy cultures  and is nowhere near as bad as charcoal smoking  plus  it s really tasty if you like canned fish for the low cost and also the health benefits  you might also buy a non oily fish head for very cheap and make fish stock which is extremely nourishing i think i will stick to herring because it is so much more delicious than sardines  i can also buy wood smoked herring packaged in plastic in the refrigerated section for very low cost  it has regular old table salt     but i will give that a try too  since it isn t canned i feel better about it didn t mean to give a lecture but there i went  as you can tell i ve done a bit of thinking and research on this and maybe someone else can benefit from it i think crown prince makes kipper snacks without salt so i will have to try those next  tasty  but  ,1,0
885,this chef michael s grilled sirloin flavor went over well with the dogs  while both are older the lapdog has a hard time with some dry foods  he was able to chew through this  i like to change dog foods often to avoid a build up of any one ingredient or vitamin  some dog foods give the dogs loose stool  but we had no problems with this  first ingredient is beef  soy  animal fat  brewers rice  corn coming far down the list which is something i prefer  we will buy this dog food again  dogs loved it,1,0

648,am getting regular delivery of these gluten free crackers   they are great with sharp cheddar cheese   the price through amazon is much better than local stores  but either way  most crackers are not whole but in pieces   so if you like whole crackers  forget it   i have contacted glutino about this issue and received a number of coupons in the mail for my efforts   but i don t see any change in the ability to have whole crackers even though there are two air filled bags of crackers in each box   otherwise  i would highly recommend these crackers for taste and texture for those on gluten free diets like i am  great tasting but many are broken,1,0

647,my fears were confirmed  this illy cappuccino doesn t have much coffee taste  all i can taste is milk and sugar  making it indistinct from other such coffee beverages like starbucks coffee frappuccino coffee drink and competitors  it s good  mind you  but nothing like fresh cappuccino  the can makes it very easy to toss in a bag and take with you on the road or to the office the can warns you not to shake  but i instinctively shook it immediately upon taking it out of the fridge and it exploded into a small mess  apparently  pressure can build up inside like a soda  even though this product is not carbonated  100 calories per can  15 from fat   made in denmark  distributed by coca cola carrageenan is an emulsifier  keeps fats and liquids from separating  derived from seaweed  cellulose gum  and i m guessing cellulose gel  improves viscosity  potassium bicarbonate and potassium citrate are ph regulator  used to control acidity  all these are natural and vegan vegetarian additives common in the food industry  why can t it just be coffee  milk  and sugar  convenient  but no different from other canned coffee drinks,1,0
889,my husband and i foster australian cattle dogs and own one ourselves  with our most recent litter of puppies they were unable to do any damage to this toy   that s a huge improvement over some of the other toys we bought them   once the puppies were gone  i gave it to my destroyer of all toys  after about a month of carrying it around and chewing on it  he has only managed to sever the head of the t rex  which makes this the champion of toys in our household i give this toy four stars just because i wouldn t recommend it for every dog   it s rock hard and can definitely do some damage  if  however  you have a power chewer and are desperate for a toy that won t easily fall apart  i would definitely suggest this product  great for my australian cattle dog ,1,0

892,i am glad to see that more and more companies are manufacturing xylitol  because the sooner it catches on nation wide  the sooner the prices will drop and become reasonable  hopefully  xylitol will eventually replace sugar as the sweetener of choice  it shouldn t cost more than sugar does i like this brand because it is usa made from birch  not corn and not china  no offense to china  but since almost all of our jobs went over there  the quality of chinese products can be  well  bad  i try to avoid  made in china  as much as possible and i look for  made in usa   this product satisfies both requisites  and it s excellent  made from biirch  made in usa,1,0
893,while traveling in new york we stopped at an inn for dinner and decided to try this with our dinner  i was a very pleasant surprise  it really tasted like raspberries  if you like raspberries and bubbles  you will not be disappointed  scale of 1 to 10 a big 10     real treat,1,0
894,i have two large dogs and a relative budget   so this maybe terrible of me  but i don t mind a little filler   and my dogs are healthy and active  even the senior  and they ve been fed on easily accessible and relatively affordable brands all of their lives   though there are some questionable ingredients in chef michaels  and some known fillers  the number one ingredient is beef and this flavor also includes filet mignon flavors  green beans and potatoes  i should say it s a pretty small bag for the cost  so over the long term this may cost twice as much  however  they really did seem to enjoy it   i would purchase this again  dog tested,1,0
895,these candy blocks are great for a lego party  only complaint is the photo shows more colors  i didn t get any white  there was only one  red  color and i only got a few green blocks  just fyi if you are specifically looking for multiple colors  not as colorful as the photo,1,0
883,this syrup is a little on the runny side  but it s a good substitute and our kids really like it  too   steer clear of the totonac option  it s disgusting  good option,1,0
867,the product itself looks luxurious  kind of iridescent and rich looking  it doesn t smell terribly nice  and the package opens on the bottom which is a real nuisance  especially given that the bottle is smooth and slippery when your hands are wet  you ll be fishing this off of the shower floor more than once the results are acceptable but not phenomenal  i d like to have been impressed  the weird package design is something of a deal breaker    this does leave your hair looking nice especially after a week or two of using it  it s conditioner  alright ,1,0
866,i love pretzels and actually bought my regular brand  but did not notice the different flavor was i disappointed when i opened the box  and saw i made an error figured might as well try one yikes they were wonderful with a special taste of melted sweet butter i now have another fav flavor of this reliable brand  different,1,0
653,i have been a fan of most of newman s products   this one i would consider average   maybe i was expecting too much from a medium roast   it is worth a try and i would purchase again   then i ll rotate my daily ingestion with some other blends so as not to get bored  newman fan,1,0
835,i have tried the cappuccino version of this drink  which is great   and was excited to try this drink  following the instructions i did not shake   i opened the drink and took a sip  the coffee is strong and has a full body  and has a good taste  for canned coffee   however  i am not sure if this is from transport  or what   the coffee is very watered down and i feel like i am tasting mostly a watered down coffee  like iced coffee where the ice has melted    the watered down taste of the coffee sticks with you  so be prepared to need something to clean your palate afterwards i do not know if the one i got went through some sort of shock or excess moisture phase during shipping to fridge  but i found it to taste watered down  not sure if it was just mine or all   the coffee is very strong and has a bold taste  but due to the watering down it takes a way from the flavor and makes it tough to drink  kind of watered down,1,0
663,i have boston terriers that destroy every toy they get their paws on  even ones made for  tough chewers    these dental dinos are the best things ever     they don t last forever  but at least i feel i m getting my moneys worth   i highly recommend these purrrfect for tough chewers ,1,0
662,after reading the reviews from others here i was expecting my package to arrive looking like a flattened crushed mess   but it didn t   my package was very well protected  double boxed and arrived looking perfect   i had never tried gluten free products before and didn t know what to expect   i found the items in this basket to be good  maybe a bit dry and bland but they were snickerdoodle cookies  nuts and crackers   good for a gift for someone who eats gluten free  looks nice and a nice variety of snacks  i did think the price was a bit high for what you receive but maybe all gluten free products are expensive  i would buy this again as a gift but not for myself  good gluten free product,1,0
838,i gave this to the wife for her to use   after a couple of applications she said that it did help her hair and was repairing the split ends   she said wouldn t know about the color repair since her hair is turning silver anyway   looking at her hair it seemed to me that it seemed fluffier and the color was a little bit bolder but hey what does a man know  clear scalp damage   color repair,1,0

661,i have lupus  and every time i get a flare  i lose a ton of hair   i also have severe reactions to some hair products that can cause even more hair loss   a volumizing shampoo that doesn t cause bad reactions is like gold to me   this shampoo works very well and did not cause my hair to fall out or my scalp to bleed   the only downside to using it is the smell   it smells a little cloying  like lotions and shampoos from the early 80s   whatever it is  my skin didn t react to it  so all s well that ends well  hair is soft and looks full   shampoo smells like the 80s ,1,0
842,after senseo stopped making pods  thought my precious senseo machine was to become obsolete  very relieved to find these pods  but confused based on the reviews  some said the pods fit the machine  other said they don t  the pods do fit  one pod fits into the two cup pod holder  however  running a  mug  sized cup through just one pod yielded terribly weak  thin coffee  awful  so  my solution has been to run a  cup  sized portion through one pod  then put in a new pod and run another  to add up to one mug sized cup of coffee  the result is not at all bitter  and while it s strong enough for me  those who like nuclear strength coffee will probably not be impressed  agree with others  the individually wrapped pods are terribly wasteful  overall  happy with this product  and will keep the subscription  works for senseo,1,0
843,first off  best hot sauce ever   almost every food i eat now has this sauce on it but don t buy it here   i know this six pack looks tempting but   the local oriental market has 18 ounce bottles for 3 39   adding up to around 20 bucks for a 6 pack   if you don t have any sort of local oriental market and none of the grocery stores carry it  it s still totally worth paying almost twice as much as it s retail value just to experience the stuff  way overpriced here   ,1,0

845,very disappointed in recent price increase for this product not sure what is going on   but i purchased three 16 oz cans for  14 in january with free shipping on  25  i ordered other items  and now i see that they sell six 12 oz cans for nearly  30  still had free shipping previous order was  29 per oz  and now it is  41 per oz  what gives  other sellers on amazon are even higher  so  i guess i won t be stocking this item again any time soon unless the price drops  i love using it in pancakes and waffles   but will just buy liquid buttermilk instead  great product   but price has increased 33  since january ,1,0

660, illy issimo  caff egrave  was a pleasant surprise to me after trying a similar illy product  illy issimo coffee drink  cappucino  8 45 ounce cans  pack of 12  where the cappuccino was a bit weak and bland for my taste  this caff egrave  had a reasonable amount of roasted coffee flavor and a bit of bite to it   like the other illy products i ve tried the caff egrave  is only moderately sweetened so if your preferred coffee drink is mcdonald s or dunkin donuts iced coffee  this product is probably not going to appeal to you   but if you d like to try a premade coffee drink that s not overly sweet and actually has a bit of roast coffee flavor  illy issimo caff egrave  may be worth a try  not too sweet  with some bite to it   good stuff,1,0
659,i was never a user of this gum back in the day  but recently took up the gum habit once again  in looking for a gum with the least amount of added  stuff  and phony sweeteners i came across this gum straight from 100 years ago  since it s only a gum and not a laptop i ll keep this simple  the gum is enjoyable  its clove flavor is subtle and has just the right amount of sugar to make it not too sweet  the gum while being chewed is rather firm as opposed to bazooka or other bubble gum  the clove flavor slips away after a short time but remains in your mouth  if you don t like cloves you might not like this gum but the clove flavor is not overpowering looking for a gum without fake sweeteners and a unique flavor  this might be for you  retro gum,1,0
658,it always astounds me when reviews for a drink mix complain about artificial flavors and sweeteners  that is pretty much a given   the product comes from a grocery shelf in a container  why are there expectations that the product should be the all natural equivalent of picking a piece of fruit off of a tree  to begin with  the flavor is fruit punch  when has that ever been a natural flavor   please   those concerned with this issue wouldn t be near any aisle containing this type of product if you want all natural   drink lemon water   flavor and vitamin c without anything artificial stepping off the soapbox now i thought that  compared to other brands of liquid water enhancers  this has been my favorite   i did contain vitamins so the labels are not misleading in any ways the taste was fantastic   it didn t have a nasty aftertaste  i had no difficulty getting the correct flavor vs water ratio the only complaint is that one squeeze does not fit all  depending on your grip  you could be using well more than one serving in your water  while this makes it easy to adjust to individual tastes  it also makes the product wasteful   i found that my water tasted wonderful with very minimal amounts of product final impression  i liked this product  it was nice to have some vitamins with my artificial flavoring and sweetener   i liked the fruit punch flavor  which is not usually a favorite of mine  and would buy this product in the future  vitamin b does give you energy  this product is not misleading ,1,0
848,great for those of us allergic to eggs wheat soy and all seafoods   few oils make it for deep frying   they either smoke at 350 degree and up or they alter the taste of a food in ways we don t like   i ve been a mazola fryer forever but decided given how hard it is to scrape off a pot it just might be not too good looking in the arteries either   better find an alternative   this one is a costly one indeed but so far no one has noticed i changed cooking oils and my fried foods are golden brown and the pot is far easier to clean   here s too my circulatory system  a non fish source of omega 3,1,0

864,i just tried these classic gel food colors by betty crocker and  like the description says  the no drip gel formula is easy to use and doesn t dilute whatever you re adding it to for color  i was especially pleased that the gel formula didn t spritz beyond my mixingbowl as sometimes happens with liquid food coloring if haste  or children  are involved in the process my only negative comment is that it required more gel food coloring than liquid to create the same color  thus making the process of coloring food less cost efficent for consumers  less mess,1,0
863,i bought these as a gift for a friend who loves pistachios   she has been beaming about them since she received them   her words    they were huge and not a bad one in the bag    i am only sorry they are out of stock   i would order another bad today  great,1,0

858,i love the taste of this product  but am disappointed that it is so finely ground   when i think of crumbled bacon  i think of small pieces   the bag i received is so finely ground it looks like bacon  saw dust    it adds a lot of bacon flavor  but requires no chewing at all   if the crumbles were bigger  this would be a five star product in my book  love this product  but   ,1,0

855,muir glen organic tomato sauce  no salt added  has 175 calories per can   muir glen organic diced tomatoes  no salt added  has 90 calories per can   muir glen s canned diced tomatoes taste surprisingly good   almost as good as muir glen s canned tomato sauce   as of june  2012  the inner lining of muir glen s canned tomato sauce is shiny  metallic brass   as of june  2012  the inner lining of muir glen s canned diced tomatoes is white plastic  probably bpa   both of these muir glen canned tomato products have no sugar added   apparently  the high calories in the canned tomato sauce results from natural sugars in the tomato fruit   i ve decided to go with muir glen s canned diced tomatoes because it s lower in calories and higher in fiber   however  i prefer the shiny  metallic brass inner can lining to the white plastic  probably bpa  inner can lining  has twice the calories of muir glen s canned diced tomatoes,1,0
656,okay  i just saw a review that said these cookies costed them 4 bucks   i just bought a pack for a dollar fifty   1 50    so that stated these cookies were fabulously deeeeelicious   smh   oh so sad how delicious these things are   if you love chocolate these are for you   now mind you when i saw and thought to buy these i thought of my last endeavor with nabisco and a new product   those horribly nasty chocolate covered oreos   they were a waste of my money and i was pissed that i still had a whole pack left   smh but these cookies right here     smh   ridiculously delicious   smh   mines were gooey  chewy  and oozing chocolate on my fingers as i ate them   i just now looked to get another cookie out of this too small 10 ounce package and was pissed that i just ate the last one   smh but then maybe it s best that the pack is only 10 ounces   cause being this good if there were more i d inhale the whole package of that size just as quickly don t get discouraged by the white chips on the package   the taste of chocolate in these cookies is so delicious and so intense that the white chips   whatever they are  become nonexistent i say this   cause i don t like white chocolate  and it s one of the main reasons i was skeptical about buying these cookies   buy them  try them for yourself   totally delicious   if nabisco continues to knock it out the park like this  maybe they ll make a comeback in my household   cause i had stopped buying cookies from disappointment in what i ve received in the recent past  delicious and cheap  ,1,0
854,this review is for the 1 7 ounce bottle   i bought some  because i do not like the fact that over 95  of equal is dextrose  sugar  only 1 7  is aspartame    white sugar is a mix of dextrose and fructose first off the white powder you get is sweet and tastes just like equal to me   for one gallon of tea i use 0 5 grams of the aspartame powder   if you use too much you will get the bitter taste   this is true also with equal  if you put too many packets in it tastes bad i fixed this problem long ago  i never use just equal   in the early days of my usage i added white sugar   then later i found i could drop the sugar and replace it with sweet n low   so to my tea i used 10 packets of equal to 4 packets of sweet n low   you can drink as much as you like all day long without an after taste   so with the aspartame powder  to my 0 5 grams of the aspartame i add the 4 packets of sweet n low the real problem with powdered aspartame is it does not dissolve in water well   it is a very fine powder and can t break the water s surface tension   it tries to clump and even when not clumped it forms a cloudy water   you solve this by the same method of making gravy from starch   you put your powder in a small bowl and add water drop by drop and make a paste   then dissolve the paste in the water of your tea or whatever you are sweetening but this is why the powdered aspartame is packaged with dextrose in the equal packets   so the particles of aspartame are separated by the dextrose particles   thus it dissolves  i think it tastes just like equal  but requires knowing how to use it ,1,0
657,my home is in a semi country setting and there are plenty of critters wandering around it   although i don t have any specific problems  i am not a fan of the many stray cats that i see  and sometimes smell   nearby   there is a sandbox for the children on the property and  even though it is covered  i worry about the cats using it as a litter box   i also worry about the possibility of animals making their way under the deck and creating nests and homes under there   my usage of this product would be to deter cats and any other critter that is seeking shelter under my deck although i do have a neighbor whose dog does his business in my yard sometimes  i would not use this near the property line of another home owner  although the product states it is safe to use around pets  the neighbors do not know that   i don t want to be seen shaking a substance near a property line and have a neighbor think it is to try to harm their pet  i hope that makes sense   i can deal with picking up occasional dog or deer doo   i cannot tolerate the smell of cat urine without cameras monitoring my property  i can t 100  verify that this product works   i did do an experiment with the family dog   i did do is sit on the floor  with my dog in the room when i took the seal off of the product   i placed the paper seal  which had product stuck to the top  product side up  on the floor next to me   my dog  a large laborador  walked by and started to sneeze  she is usually a  close sniffer  but didn t even attempt to investigate the seal   she then walked around me and sat far away from the seal   she did eventually get up and walk near the seal several times but not close enough to sneeze the smell of the product was actually somewhat pleasant  it is a mix of cedar  wood and spices   i sprinkled it around my flower beds  the perimeter of the deck  and in a wide circle around my kid s sandbox i didn t use it near my garbage cans as this is not an area of concern for me   i could see the benefit of sprinkling it around the cans or even some inside without surveillance tapes  i can say that this works   what i can say is that  at least with my dog  it discouraged her from coming near the area final impression  i like the smell of the product   it did prove to discourage a dog  i have not smelled cat urine or skunk near my home since applying the product   i think the price is a bit steep  however  in 30 days  if i start to smell cat urine again near my home  i would shell out the money to buy a canister of the product  may not  repel  but does discourage ,1,0
852,after you read the label and realize that it has more antioxidants than any green tea  and then read how much calories it has  only 50   and then realize how its caffeine level is just that as much as coffee  you will taste it  and then after you finish the whole serving you will realize how much more awake and refreshed you feel  it s kind of crazy  i was in denial myself  you feel as if you can write a 20 page paper  when it says  focused energy  on the label  you better believe it  the guayusa tea leaf from the amazon is something that most beverages have not realized exists  so get on it before some other brand does  because i could imagine if another brand gets on this niche  they re definitely going to mess it up  whether that be via too much added sugars  or artificial flavor  just do it  runa tea,1,0

856,i seldom write reviews but after reading the only review on this product for the 8 ounce bag size package  the 1 7 ounce bottle has no reviews    i bought some  because i do not like the fact that over 95  of equal is dextrose  sugar  only 1 7  is aspartame    white sugar is a mix of dextrose and fructose first off the white powder you get is sweet and tastes just like equal to me   for one gallon of tea i use 0 5 grams of the aspartame powder   if you use too much you will get the bitter taste  or sour as the other reviewer said that it tasted    this is true also with equal  if you put too many packets in and it tastes bad i fixed this problem long ago  i never use just equal   in the early days of my usage i added white sugar   then later i found i could drop the sugar and replace it with sweet n low   so to my tea i used 10 packets of equal to 4 packets of sweet n low   you can drink as much as you like all day long without an after taste   so with the aspartame powder  to my 0 5 grams of the aspartame i add the 4 packets of sweet n low the real problem with powdered aspartame is it does not dissolve in water well   it is a very fine powder and can t break the water s surface tension   it tries to clump and even when not clumped it forms a cloudy water   you solve this by the same method of making gravy from starch   you put your powder in a small bowl and add water drop by drop and make a paste   then dissolve the paste in the water of your tea or whatever you are sweetening but this is why the powdered aspartame is packaged with dextrose in the equal packets   so the particles of aspartame are separated by the dextrose particles   thus it dissolves   the previous reviewer most likely did not taste sweetness because it was at the bottom of his cup  how to use this powder  it tastes fine,1,0

644,i ve used vegit for 30 years so i ve seen it be in a giant clump  too   yours may be stale  but it may just be vegit  which does clump up even in the freezer  i keep it in the freezer sealed in a glass jar  between uses   the taste will tell you whether the spices themselves are stale as for it being too salty for the other reviewer   if it s salty  at all   it s not vegit  tho it may be spike   two different products hth  vegit is delicious if you can t eat any salt,1,0

929,this hair conditioner is an excellent product for dry and damaged hair  it provides a very luxurious  thick cream that is absorbed into the hair after shampooing  however  it is not heavy and does not leave any oily residue  my hair was tangle free and free of split ends  it was shiny and easy to manage without getting oily afterwards the only thing i did not like was the container  in as effort to get all the material out that is in the bottle  the opening is on the bottom  with a touch of your finger you can pop the bottle open and squeeze out what you need  then re close it  however  i found that it leaks if you are not careful to get it closed tightly  i would rather see the opening on top instead of the bottom but the product itself was excellent  excellent moisturizer for dry hair,1,0
624,excellent product for treating shrubs my dwarf alberta spruce trees are looking excellent just a couple of tips if you have someone that can help you then have them stand at your outdoor water supply to turn it on and off for you this way you can have the valve open on the bug b gon max before you turn your water supply on im my humble opinion this method will keep unsafe pressure levels from building up in the dispenser when you are done spraying your section have your partner turn off the water supply before closing the valve on the dispenser the second tip is make sure you turn your water supply up high when spraying if your water pressure is too weak the product will not leave the dispenser these are just my opinions from my own experience using this product  good product,1,0

620,very nice conditioner  contains natural oils   left my curly hair a lot more manageable  even after a bath with epsom salts didn t do much for my scalp  but then my scalp is only dry in hot or very cold temperatures  which don t generally last too long in s  ca can back comb right through when wet smell is ok   not my favorite  but is ok and doesn t bother me after use   i prefer natural pure essential oils rather than chemical scents i m not sure why the cosmetics industry uses so much titanium dioxide in everything from toothpaste  very concerning if you have kids around  but not great for adults either  but it does apparently make your teeth whiter  and hair more reflective i imagine  yet i can t help but wonder how daily exposure affects a person     or coloring for their products that are used daily  i suspect the red dye  33 might be the culprit that caused some itching after a couple of uses itching  could have been something else  or just  that time of year   thankfully this conditioner doesn t contain formaldehyde  like many  many shampoos   conditions do    that can cause allergic reactions   especially after using them for a long time overall  works well  smell is ok  not bad  but not a favorite scent  but neither are some really great  truly natural shampoos   conditioners  it does work nicely  if i had to just grab something and the store didn t have my brands  then i would be drawn to this   a few others to be fair  if you look at the labels of just about all good shampoos and conditioners  there are going to be chemicals my favorite conditioner is vegetable glycerin with my own blend of sweet peos  pure essential oils  from a respectable peo brand    great for hair  dry skin   you can choose   create your own scents by mixing your own oils   note  if you do decide to make your own  many so called  peo blends  are adulterated  or stretched out with cheaper oils oils vary widely by price    for instance orange oils are roughly  4 an ounce  while real rose oil  rose absolute  is roughly  435 per ounce  aura cacia is a very respectable brand dealer of peos and there are others  but that one comes to mind  if it says  blend  or x  rose  or whatever you favorite oils  go elsewhere for your peos i just planted my own roses and use a rose  tea    open the windows and doors when the roses are blooming really  this is one of the better  see it everywhere  products out there  although i d like to see real natural products that work   they do exist many chemical additives can be absorbed through the skin my philosophy is that if you wouldn t eat it  then you probably shouldn t be putting it on your skin  with the exception of mud   mineral baths  which are incredible  and are fine with me in a bottle as well  if naturally occurring and non toxic for a drug store brand  they did pretty well in comparison  the small is nice  but not a favorite   it does get the tangles out i d rather have a natural formula  or make my own  but this one  if you need to jut grab some conditioner   it s good after a swim in the pool as well  pretty good  but lost a star for the chemicals that weren t needed or really desirable imho   the smell was a bit odd  nice conditioner   smell is ok   leaves hair soft   with almost no tangles,1,0
947,hey  this was a surprise   i keep having trouble finding my goat s milk in town  everyone seems to be sold out at the same time  and the safeway stopped carrying it all together   my girl friend teased me about buying the milk on amazon   that s how i found this  and thought  why not give it a try   alas  it is still powdered milk   if you are familiar with cow powdered milk and hate the smell of it as i do  you will recognize the smell in this milk   the big surprise was that it actually tasted good and the smell went away after getting thoroughly mixed   it still had little clumps that refused to dissolve  but it didn t smell icky and tasted just like the real thing as a side note  i also discovered goat s milk freezes well  so i ve been doing that and saving the powdered stuff for emergencies  powdered milk,1,0

949,i purchased this cereal from the greenwise section of my local publix   it s a nice organic cereal with crunchy granola  crispy rice  and toasted oats   i pay between  3 00  3 99 per 17 oz  box it s great to get it on sale but rare  you get a lot of cereal for your money as compared with other organic cereals which are typically 13 14 oz  per box the cereal is hearty and saftisfying   however  if you are in the habit of not consuming sugar the initial bowl can be a bit alarming the cereal contains all organic ingredients   whole grain oats  sugar  crisp rice  rice sugar  sea salt  malt   sunfolower oil  whole grain oat flour  molasses  maltodextrin  honey  sea salt  and vanilla extract a serving size is 2 3 of a cup and the box contains 8 servings  that s a bit skimpy as most organic cereal serving sizes are typically one cup   the fat content may be the culprit total fat per serving is 6 g and 42 g of carbs   the sugar content is 14 g  5 g protein  3 g of fiber  and a mere trace of honey however  to the credit of the manfacturer they didn t say it was a healthy cereal  it s organic and wholesome and full of flavors   i give this cereal a 4 5 for flavor  5 5 for maintaining organic integrity  and 5 5 for being earth friendly  recycled packaging   cascadian farm organic granola   oats   honey,1,0
619,my family absolutely loves this original recipe for ovaltine   it is the only thing they like in their milk the  new and improved  recipe on the other hand  is horrid   there are not words to describe the disgusting new recipe   the whole change reminds me of  new coke   this review is for the original recipe shown in the pic ,1,0
950,dog food is a somewhat tough thing to give a review on  but i ll give it a try   we have a english mastiff who is 10  years old and weighs about 165 pounds   she started out eating iams dog food for about the first 5 years when we switched her over to purina dog chow   since that time we have been given bought two other brands of dog food and our dog wouldn t touch either brand   one was kibbles and bits and one was science diet we attempted the  mixing in  of the dog food but she would pick out her normal food and leave the rest   purina beneful was an amazon vine choice this month and i thought i would give it a try   our dog didn t notice a bit of difference between her dog chow and beneful   i did not notice any changes in her stool during this change or any  other  side affects   our healthy  picky eater  mastiff had no problems with this food and i would buy it again    hey  she likes it and at her age  she might as well enjoy what she can with the time she has left  she ate it   that s a plus ,1,0
951,bob s red mill is always of the highest quality and i always choose their brand over any other   that being said i must emphatically say that soy flour is pretty darn nasty tasting   i suggest that if you are going to use it  blend it in with other flours  if you can    you can probably get used to the taste  but kinda leaves an aftertaste that is unpleasant to me at least  good luck  the good and the bad,1,0
952,i not a cat person  i love dogs  but theres this alley cat that grown on me and i on him  i feed him  i bought him generic food he ate but no more than 1 2 cup a day not even that much  skinny cat   however i kid u not i got this bag out when generic ran out and the cat just ran to the bag sniffed and rubbed on it i put out for him to eat and he ate it like it wasnt nobodies business  he eats about 1 cup a day so thats good im trying to put wait on him  so next ill deworm him and flea him then see about vaccines  but for now hes a happy alley cat w  his cat chow  i dunno why purina gets bad name  i used to feed puppy chow to my pit bull he loved it grew up on it and was very healthy muscular  now im getting a staffy and deciding to feed him puppy chow or buffalo ill see  good luck pet lovers  anybody want a cat  lol cat loves it,1,0
618,these are your typical pop tarts  they taste fine   i only ordered them so i wouldn t have to go to the stores to buy them   they also don t sell large boxes like this of the same flavor  good,1,0
617,the product is exactly what i wanted   looks good and is soooo much fun   and the email responses from the seller were timely and informative  i had trouble disconnecting the coin mechanism so it would work without having to insert a coin  i followed all instructions and even advice over the phone  when i was still unable to disconnect the mechanism from the unit using excessive force  i emailed the seller for additional suggestions because i did not want to break the machine  i never got a response from the seller and am still not able to disconnect the mechanism  love the machine   but   ,1,0
943,i like the chocolate alot better than the original version  there isn t much of an after taste and it goes down easy  the taste is not bad,1,0
928,california apparently has banned the use of the word  biodegradable  in bags because of misleading advertising   the kyjen bags  for example  are made of polyethylene with biodegradable cornstarch added but the box makes it sound as though the bag breaks down completely   this is the only bag i have found that breaks down completely in the landfill  rather than into small pieces of plastic this size  however  is too small for my 95 lb lab   biobags come in a large size  which should solve the problem others have had with a clean pickup  biodegradable bags ,1,0

634,first  like others have mentioned  mine arrived in a plastic wrap in a package with its lid open and shampoo all over the interior of the plastic wrap  not only was it a mess to open   but 1 3 the bottle was already gone  next came trying the product   so far 1 weeks time and i will update again after a month goes by  when i first put some on my hair and begain to lather i stopped and made sure i used the right bottle     its like a cream  and doesn t feel like a shampoo normally would feel  i thought i grabbed the wrong bottle  i m mixed on how the product feels  though it did leave my hair nice  but my other shampoos still do better  i tend to use various products and never the same shampoo when i run out  its almost as if my hair gets use to a product and it no longer works well  so i mix it up i do like the smell to the product and don t find it overwhelming as others suggested  i did not find it dulled my hair  i do have highlights my hair did feel clean  not oily or dirty looking as others have experienced  think this is a try it out and see kind of product  everyones hair is so different so each review is based on the persons kind of hair really  my hair is normally not oily  but is flat and below shoulder length with highlights  i saw no major changes compared to other products so for that reason its ok  i do not like the cap to the bottle and again how its packaged  nothing like getting a product and loosing 1 3 of it and having a huge mess      perhaps if you want to try it try it at a local store  decent shampoo   bad packaging and bottle leaks in shipping,1,0
897,my cat enjoys these  and buying them off amazon saves money  but i ve noted she s less enthusiastic about this flavor  and she ll only eat it if we re out of every other treat and she s completely desperate not to eat her regular food   it s not just my cat either  my friend s cat doesn t like them as much as the ones in the orange or blue bags   stay away from the cheese flavored ones in the yellow bag  i can only assume they re really gross as they just set in the dish  untouched  acceptable cat treat,1,0
898,these used to be much better before   i have noticed that the product may be a bit inconsistent from time to time  not impressed,1,0
899,when i shop for tea i ve learned that brand name does matter and i always look for twinings for they have loose tea available in hermetically sealed  metal cans that i like better than tea bags   i avoid buying tea bags because i know that any tea with an essential oil added to it for flavor and not packaged in a lamination of saran coated paper and polyethylene will deteriorate if not sealed in packaging such as that used by twinings  they have had a good reputation for many years and i m sure they want to keep it that way   there are many vendors trying to sell boutique or  artisanal   that seems to be the latest buzz word   teas but very few know the correct packaging to use  buy the tried and proven  buy twinings  drink it until you learn what a quality tea is supposed to taste like  then you can go and buy some of those  junk  teas and see how you like them  quality is this brands middle name,1,0
901,obviously some of the reviewers don t know what coconut oil is  if it arrived  hard as a rock  it means the air was cold  if it was  semi liquid  then it was a little warmer in the delivery truck  coconut oil is generally solid unless you melt it  that said    i ordered this for popcorn and for general cooking  i couldn t detect any flavor in it but it did make the popcorn taste good  i used it for cooking and it seems to work well  i was skeptical because it is so much cheaper than other coconut oil which cost generally 50 00   60 00 for a gallon  the label doesn t say how it was processed so maybe that s why it is cheaper  maybe i should care about processing but i m hoping it doesn t matter that much  the color doesn t matter to me  hopefully i ll be able to enjoy the benefits of coconut oil without the steep price tags the other brands have  the only negative is the container  it really is hard to get out  i ll be melting it and putting some in a smaller container that will be easier to use  get it    try it    you ll like it  a really good product,1,0

904,this is by far the best non artifically flavored coffee on the market  never bitter  not too strong or too weak  but just right  i am drinking it while writing this little missive and feeling more alive with every sip  caribou keeps me going ,1,0
641,this shampoo cleans well and leaves your hair soft  but i can t discern any difference between this and most other shampoos on the market   it has a light  pleasant scent    not too perfumey    and it lathers well   i would use it again  but it s nothing to get super excited about  good  but nothing special,1,0
906,i ve tried both the illy issimo caffe and the illy issimo cappuccino   i gave the cappuccino 5 stars because it tastes like a creamy iced cappuccino made with espresso from a machine the caffe is also good and also tastes legitimately like it s a not strong espresso   however  i didn t find it to be the same quality as the cappuccino   it s ok   it tastes like an ok iced sweetened espresso caffe from an average coffee place   i surely would drink it   it s just not a 5 star product   good   not great note  this drink does not have any kind of cream milk in it   it s a black sweetened coffee  good  but not as good as the cappuccino,1,0
907,this was my first order of k cups and i was looking to try various types of flavored coffees   in a 34 cup variety pack  i received 13 different flavors from 4 roasters   while the overall variety was nice  the   of cups per variety varied   1 cup for 4 different flavors  2 cups for 4 different flavors  3 cups for 1 flavor  4 cups for 2 flavors  5 cups for 1 flavor  and 6 cups for 1 flavor   i m a bit disappointed in the   of cups per flavor wasn t more consistent as both my husband and i wanted to try each flavor we received   also  i suspect that some of the cups may be old as the 14 of the 34 cups are holiday flavors from past holidays last year  it s june 2012 and i rec d 4 cups each of spicy eggnog   gingerbread and 6 cups of pumpkin spice   13 varieties but old holiday flavors   inconsistent   per variety,1,0

908,i hear that this is a fine product  i really like old fashioned cocktails and decided that this would be a fine addition to my bar    i purchased this product and paid my money for it  i waited anxiously for the tawny bottle to arrive    i waited weeks    i contacted the seller  the seller told me that they sent the bottle and that it was not their problem  to my dismay  amazon was unwilling to assist me  after several emails back and forth    i simply gave up and re purchased a more expensive bottle of peychaud s aromatic bitters from my local liquor store    needless to say  the bitters are sensational  but do yourself a favor    look at your seller s rating before you purchase anything from amazon  don t learn this lesson the hard way like i did  never got it    had to re purchase locally,1,0

912,you just can t beat the taste of the original dubble bubble gumballs  it really doesn t matter that the taste only last a minute or so  but that is why i bought the tub  the  tub by the way is very convenient  and was shipped to me in a    condition  if your longing for the classic taste go for it  you will not be dissappointed  good  ol dubble bubble taste     ,1,0
913,i ve tried tons of foods in the past and had to change  either they didn t work after months of being religiously measured out  or she would get sick of them and cry for something different  with this she has lost 1 5 lbs in over 2 months  and she s not showing signs of still being hungry  or wanting something different  my cat likes this ,1,0
639,this is great popcorn     i just purchased a second batch   i never had a problem w a ton of kernels left in my air popper or many hulls   as long as this is being produced and sold i will be a buyer the only con i have is that the only seal on the canister is a small piece of tape on the lid canister   i was surprised to not see some type of freshness seal like you would see on a ketchup bottle   surprisingly though i had no issues with humidity effecting the corn  maybe because i m in a dryer climate    returning customer ,1,0
635,i started ordering this green tea after i got an extremely bad shipment of the davidson s gunpowder green  i really like this  and it is a good price with the subscription  sticking with this one and i will not go back to davidson s  so much better  uses less tea also  which further reduces cost  really good,1,0

923,this syrup is just fine  but if you re expecting something other than molasses  you ll be disappointed   it s not as strongly flavored or as thick as some brands of molasses  but as far as i can tell it s essentially the same thing    wikipedia says it s sweeter than molasses  because no sugar has been removed from it  but wikipedia also says it s a kind of golden syrup  which it ain t  i bought it because i was hoping to find a syrup that tasted like the karo syrup i remember from my childhood  before government subsidized  high fructose corn syrup took over the world   steen s is a very different product  which i wish had been made clear in amazon s product description   i assume it s good for anything light molasses is good for  but it s not karo   of course  karo isn t karo anymore  either  i ve since discovered that lyle s golden syrup  from england  tastes just like the karo syrup i remember   it s also cane syrup  but it s made by a different process   it s available on amazon in a variety of packages  it s molasses,1,0
922,my son wanted a pitcher plant and after reading the reviews we decided to try this one  it arrived looking just like the one in the photo and now about six weeks later  it has about doubled the number of shoots growing from it  i wouldn t hesitate to order another plant from this dealer  just what we wanted ,1,0
921,i am not normally big on the flavored coffees  but kahlua is an exception   this is not a strong  bold coffee  but then you don t want the coffee to overpower the kahlua flavor   yes  i know that kahlua is a coffee liquor  but it still has its own unique flavor which i like   it is not overpowering and it is not artifical   just right  kahlua is one of my favorites,1,0
636,the description said there are 5 flavors in this mix   grape  lemon  lime  cherry and orange   my bag had orange  apple  cherry strawberry  strawberry cherry   and that s it   there s an orange one  a yellowish one  apple    and two slightly different red pink ones which i can t determine the exact flavor of   however  they are good   the apple  is especially good   i d get these again even though i m not 100  certain of what flavors i d receive   wouldn t matter   they re good regardless  good  but not what the description said ,1,0
645,so i ve tried this type of product before   i believe it was put out by kraft  mio liquid    but it ended up making my otherwise fresh  delicious  and pure water taste like a semi polluted river from an industrial accident   with less than high hopes for this vitamin squeeze  i poured myself some water  dumped some of this stuff in  drank it   and didn t feel the need to spew it back out in fact  it tasted quite a bit like gatorade or vitamin water   somewhat pleasant  but not all the way   in fact  i ll probably use the rest of the bottle before making my final decision to keep buying using it or not    unlike the kraft stuff that went straight to the trash  the two main factors i don t like this are 1   red  40   why can t a company spend a few extra cents and use something natural   i don t want my kids drinking this  though i m a little more lenient for myself    swap that artificial flavors with beet juice   get the same redness without the additives 2   the sweetener   it s the sucralose or whatever stuff that leaves the weird aftertaste   while certainly better than high fructose corn syrup as far as what i want in my body  it s the aftertaste that is the biggest disappointment of the flavor of this stuff   what s wrong with going  old fashioned  and using  sugar    surely  somebody still grows sugar somewhere in the world   if you re in the market for something like this  i d recommend trying a single bottle before investing in a 4 pack case   it s better than the competition  for sure   but might not be quite what you re hoping for  not usually fond of this type of product,1,0
637,this brew is not bitter or too strong  it makes a good cup of coffee if you like a mild taste one of the better cups,1,0
638,i have two maltese dogs  a male who is 13 and a female who is 11   the female will eat nearly anything that doesn t try to eat her first   the male will hardly eat at all unless you beg him   both of them liked the grilled sirloin part pretty well   the  potato and green bean garnish  part tended to stay in the bowl a while  though my little girl would eventually eat that  too  usually   dogs are not fans of veggies of any kind and so i was not surprised   but overall  they liked it pretty well  which is saying a lot for what is mostly a dry dog food   i have not seen this in the store where i buy my dog food   when it does  and if it does  the price will determine for me whether i ll start buying this brand or stay with the brand i was already using   i think my dogs liked this enough that i d be willing to switch  but only if the price was the same or not much more  sirloin yes  potato and green bean  not so much,1,0
918,this stuff is pretty convenient   just flip open the top and shoot a squeeze  a big squeeze  into a cup of water  and  voila       you have a fruit punch flavored vitamin c reinforced energy drink   well  kind of   it tastes  red  at least   and remotely medicinal  but that didn t bother me too much another reviewer suggested adding to milk   i did so with positive results   i suppose one might also try a variation involving vodka  i m just sayin   anyway  this is not the beverage breakthrough of the century  but not an altogether bad idea   with an ice cube you can turn a glass of tepid water into something a little bit good for you and a little bit more exciting   a  for convenience    c  for flavor    b   for nutrition,1,0
917,vitamin water   not fantastic  not bad   i am not a huge fan of  energy  drinks  or the creepy buzz they offer   this one didn t seem to have any of those effects so that made me like it more   relatively high in vitamin c and since our bodies need vitamin c all day long  it is never a bad thing to keep it coming the flavor was ok   not something i will crave  but not bad   i water any fruit juice down that i drink  and this had a watered down taste that was even to watered down for me   if that helps   i like it mild and this was too mild in general   hope that makes some sense  didn t love the flavor  but it is ok,1,0
916,i think the flavor of this product is close to kool aid  which depending on your point of view may be good or bad   i actually liked the fruit punch flavor  definitely old school after all the new flavor combinations companies come up with these days   i drank it both watery and strong  and when drinking it strong  it feels like it has a lot of caffeine   initially  i felt a little jittery  but it passed quickly   i don t know if it s necessarily high in caffeine  since it s hard to judge how much actually goes into a glass of water   but i definitely felt it   it may be the combination of the caffeine and vitamin c   to me  it falls somewhere between drinking a red bull  not too strong  to monster  very strong    still  it s a decent product and i would buy it again  i like the taste  but it feels heavy on caffeine,1,0
915,strong espresso taste with a hint of mil  but a tiny bit bitter for me  yet not as much as the cappuccino flavor  if you like a little bitterness  then you ll prolly love this  thankfully no can taste  which was a concern of mine  i prefer a bit more milk in mine  soy or rice  otherwise not much to say   plain  no flavors  although i m sure you could add your own if you want i  but taste fine just like it is the bitterness was just a hint  which many regular espresso drinkers probably wouldn t notice   for me  it was enough to take off a star  but was still good  don t know that i ll be buying a lot of it  but for that allergy or headache  when i use that caffeine  it would be great to have around to get rid of those  strong espresso flavor with a hint of milk,1,0
914,it s granulated onion  certainly not powdered   i get it here  because i can t get it locally   you can only get the tone s powdered crap at sam s club   much more satisfying flavor  and you can use less and still get the flavor profile you desire  it is  what it is   ,1,0
919,i was a little concerned due to the lack of reviews   however they turned out to be very good   i will certainly buy again  concerned,1,0
954,i ordered this for my son s birthday cake  it was adorable  and i got lots of compliments    i put it on a plain white 8  round cake i ordered and it was easy to put on  though not as flat as i would have liked  be careful that your cake is very flat  i will say  though  that well into the  expected delivery  window the product hadn t shipped  and i emailed the seller to cancel the order  miraculously  i was informed by the seller  but not by amazon  that it had already shipped and was too late to cancel  it did end up arriving a couple days later  but it took over a week from the time i ordered it until it actually shipped  i was frustrated with the experience  product   good  seller   meh ,1,0

664,i am just dumbfounded by all the people saying this cereal is too sweet  the only way you can think this is too sweet is if any amount of sweetness is too much for you  i m not sure if the amount of sugar was lessened at some point  but as it is now  it s really not that sweet  it has 7g of sugar  and while i wouldn t call that unsweetened  it is a pretty modest amount  it s nowhere near as sweet as mini wheats  for example all in all  good cereal  i would buy it again  pretty good  and definitely not too sweet,1,0
743,not a girly boy pepper like what you find in the grocery store  this has a kick in it and you will taste the pepper   it has been nearly 30 years since i can remember tasting pepper  it all seems so weak now  not this  brought back memories of what pepper tastes like  very tasty,1,0
699,this product is great as usual   most people know callebaut chocolate so i wont elaborate on that   however what i will elaborate on is the seller i have never ordered meltable or perishable items online that have ever came to me in any kind of usable condition   but  culinary direct packaged this stuff so well that even after 5 days on a ground shipment from california to north carolina  by the time i finally got through the packaging  the tape  the bubble pack  the ice pack  the chocolate inside was unmarred and not a single disc had even smudged the outside of the packaging   i can not believe the amount of care that went into this package and the fact that even with such a small amount they took the time to provide the best product experience  more for seller not product,1,0
698,i rented a place at the beach for a week and the mosquitoes swarmed us when we arrived  big ones with no fear  several at one time would lite on my legs and arms allowing me to smash them instead of flying  they must have been real hungry  i talked to a guy at ace hardware about the problem  he recommended the cutter backyard bug control  said he had a friend who practically had stock in the stuff  i went back and sprayed as far as the hose would reach around the house  this was right about dark  the next morning at 6 am i walked the dog and there wasn t even one mosquito let me compare my experience to others the sprayer worked fine for me down to about two ounces  i held the sprayer at different angles trying to get the suction tube to pick up the liquid but it didn t work  in he end i had to just pour the last two ounces out onto the ground since this is my first day after applying the stuff i ll see if it lasts for the week from the other reviews i may have been lucky my sprayer worked as well as it did and ended up with only two ounces that wouldn t spray   i ll update this if the mosquitoes return before the week is over  the first day and i m satisfied so far,1,0
697,eight o clock coffee has to be the cheapest whole bean coffee on amazon  and while you are sacrificing quality for price  you aren t sacrificing too much   if you re looking for something especially good  this isn t the coffee for you  but it s a nice backup coffee that you won t make you feel like you re money was wasted   my biggest problem is that  with the large size  the coffee begins to go stale towards the end of the bag  but then again most of the coffee you find at the grocery store comes stale anyways  so it s better than nothing   budget coffee,1,0
696,just a word of advice to those of you who are considering bulk ordering this product   it does not store well     if you order more than you can use in a few short months  make sure that you have a dry and preferably vacuum sealed environment in which to store the unused portion i bought a couple of lbs of powder and used it a couple of times   stored the extra lbs in a kitchen cabinet in their original packaging   months later  the unopened bags of powder were as hard as rocks     have your storage method ready before you buy    ,1,0

747,dan s perfect popcornnote   this is a very thorough recipe  but it is very important you follow these steps closely heat 2 tbs of vegetable oil in a medium sized pot for 5 minutes on high pour in 1 2 cup of popcorn kernels and leave uncovered   as soon as the first kernel pops  put the lid on crooked to let the steam escape note  if your popcorn rises too high and is close to touching the bottom of the lid  use a clear lid  then remove the lid  do not let the popcorn touch the moisture that accumulates on the bottom of the lid  it will ruin all those pieces when finished popping  about 1 second in between pops   pour popcorn into a large bowl and place the empty pot back on the burner  now turned off  add 1 tbs of unsalted butter  cut into small squares  into the pot you just cooked your popcorn in  hold the pot and angle it so that the butter just stays on one side of the pot  if there are any remaining bits of popcorn in the pot  use your butter knife to knock them down into the melted butter  these are great little nuggets of joy while eating the popcorn slowly pour half of the butter over the popcorn in a circular fashion  starting at the center and working your way outward to the edge of the bowl  you want to pour a little more butter around the center and less around the edges  since the center of the bowl is the deepest  sprinkle salt  1 2 the amount you would use  over the top  use your butter knife and your opposite hand together to lightly toss the popcorn note  it is important to salt your popcorn after you pour the butter and before tossing  because the salt will stick better to the popcorn pour the other half of the melted butter over the popcorn  sprinkle the other half of salt over your popcorn   lightly toss again   taste it   add salt if necessary   eat right away note  if you like your popcorn more buttery and or oily  add 1 2 to 1 tbs of each to the recipe  dan s perfect popcorn,1,0

752,we tried this recently  i have to say i was pleasantly surprised first off  i am allergic to aspartame  so most of the great flavors of drink mixes out there arealready off my radar   after living in a place with nasty ol  well water for a few years  i developeda soda habit that i am trying to break  i ve tried plain tea  don t care much for it  so looked fora decent flavored tea that i didn t have to boil water for  partially disabled  and no stove  etcwhere i am most of the time  last time at the store  i saw these  the package is a little deceptive  so be aware that  five calories  is not even for one whole bottle of water   it is for half of a bottle of waterwith one packet mixed in  i guess they didn t want to post double digits of a whopping ten calories but that s what it is for one packet the sweeteners are three kinds   honey  sugar and sucralose  why they needed three  i do not know it actually ends up being a little too sweet  i make it  them dilute it with more water thanit technically needs not sure why lipton can t just make something all natural  or use stevia  which has no effect onblood glucose  they seem to be hesitant to use it for some reason  but i don t know why  they have noproblems loading up the other drinks with chemical sweeteners  but avoid stevia   weird   i have had a lot of problems with my throat swelling up this week  but i have been sick  i am not sureif it is related to the illness  or because i ve been drinking this tea almost exclusively for the lastfew days  aspartame makes my mouth  tongue and throat swell up  which is why i read every label now not sure if the sucralose is doing anything or not   i would tend to think not  because my lips are notnumb nor is my tongue swollen  still  i d avoid the sucralose if i could the flavor is really sweet  but i like it  it is refreshing and tasty  again  a little too sweet for mypersonal tastes  so i  water  it down with lots of ice  and it makes it very good it s worth trying  this is the only flavor we ve tried so far  but will definitely give the others a shotas well  if it helps me give up soda  then that s even better     update july 9  2012 well  it has been incredibly hot here in the midwest  with a heat wave that broke all kinds of records of course  i was drinking a lot of tea  these packets are 10 calories each  that  5 calories  on the box refers to halfof one packet    and i had either one or two packets each day for the last month  perhaps we also tried the peach flavor now  and i don t care for it  but my husband and son like it better than this one i had to come back and add to the review because of something kind of odd  now  i am hypoglycemic  so maybe that is part of it but i have to mention it in case others have this problem  i got this tea originally to help me get away from my pepsi habit the 24 oz bottles of pepsi that i buy have 300 calories in the bottle  i make the tea kind of weak  so one packet actually makes closer to 32 ounces of liquid for me   i like the flavor better that way  just personal preference   so by comparison  i am getting just 10 calories for 32 oz  vs the 300 in the 24 oz pepsi  savings of about 97  of the calories  which should be a good thing here s the kicker   i have been gaining weight since i changed over to the tea  nothing else has changed  i didn t suddenlytake up eating endlessly  etc  and in fact  have eaten a little less during this heat wave  i put on almost five pounds in the last few weeks of changing over to this tea  now  from a caloric standpoint  it doesn t seem possible  however  i am one of those people who does much better on high protein  low carb  if you have a similar type of metabolism body  then be aware of these little packets   i think it might be the honey in them creating a non stop  because i sip tea all day long to keep cool  assault on my blood sugars  i ve noticed that i feel hungry more often as well too  i normally don t get all that hungry   just have a few hungry days once in a while  with this tea  it almost gives you the munchies  i haven t indulged  so it isn t from extra food  it has to be the tea again  i have to say that i don t think that everyone will experience this effect  but wanted to bring it up i think the combo of the three sugars lipton has chosen to use for reasons unknown are having a negative effect for me personally i still like the tea  but have now been cutting it down even more  to see if i can lessen the effects of the sweeteners i find it odd to think that i could cut out 590 calories a day  i usually drank two of those 24 oz pepsis  yes  i was bad     and gain weight  it has to be the way all those sugars are interacting with my system so  if you are one of those folks who do really well on a low carb diet  be aware that this tea could cause you to lose progress  or even cause you to gain weight  i have also warned my husband  who tends towards higher blood glucose  to only drink it with meals  never alone like i do   just an important heads up on what could have been the best thing to happen to tea in a long  long time lipton   please try making something with stevia  which has no impact on blood glucose levels and has no calories  why put sucralose into your items  when stevia is so much better   i don t get it   it can t be that much cheaper to use  and i d pay more for an item that used stevia    what a shame  they lose a star for having so many types of sweeteners   ,1,0
692,planters has released an impressive product   these snacks are quite delectable and full of protein however  buyer beware  those with peanut allergies should avoid this product  this snack is dangerous for those individuals  while there is some mention on the label that the product contains peanuts  i think that there really should be a more prominent warning about this  maybe planters thinks its customers will realize that this product is not intended for those with peanut allergies  but as a company you can never be too careful about keeping your customers safe i enjoyed this product  and it earns four out of five stars easily  but i can not recommend it for everybody  those with peanut allergies should stay clear  good  but not for everyone ,1,0

688,after my sister in law struggled to produce enough milk following breast surgery  she finally had to switch to infant formula  we researched formulas and finally settled on this one  my nephew you loved it and has thrived on this formula  as far as the arsenic concerns  the sugar content in brown rice syrup can create false positives on certain lab tests for arsenic  duke university used a control with much lower levels of sugar in it and tested on equipment not capable of the very sensitive testing required for this sort of comparison  it was honestly very irresponsible of them to declare their finding accurate  it has been show through specialized testing their findings were completely inaccurate  that being said i am sure natures one will be going out of their way now to find brown rice with even lower levels of arsenic  i will not hesitate to use this product with my own infant due in october  wonderful formula ,1,0
759,it took me a long time to try these larabars out and i don t know what really prompted me to try one finally but i am so glad i did   from the flavors that i have tried some just blew me away while some really left me feeling unsatisfied in the flavor department   i will rate the ones out of 5 stars that i have tried  1 being terrible and 5 being so delicious peanut butter cookie  5 stars for this one  so delicious     it tasted just like peanut butter cookie dough but made with crunchy peanut butter due to the nuts that are not ground up   such amazing texture and taste  it actually is better when left in the sun to warm up   the flavor comes out so much better and texture too   this has to be my favorite so far out of the ones i have tried pecan pie  5 stars for this one   i am not a pie person at all  and pecan pie would never be my first choice but after having this larabar i am hooked on its flavor   it tastes just like pecan pie  no kidding   it s so strange how such simple ingredients can taste like the real thing   it has a very deep flavor  almost a caramel molasses flavor   there are nice pieces of pecans and almonds but not too many to overwhelm the bar itself peanut butter and jelly  4 stars for this one   it tastes just like that stuff called goober where there is peanut butter and jelly in the same jar   i grew up eating that stuff and it s so much fun to be able to get that same flavor with this larabar   i only gave it 4 stars though because it tends to get really tart due to that unsweetened cherries but still really delicious apple pie  2 stars for this one   this was such a forgettable flavor  it was too tart in my opinion to taste like apple pie and they were really heavy on the cinnamon   don t get me wrong  i know that they are not suppose to really taste like the title says but it still is my least favorite out of the ones i have tried cherry pie  3 5 stars for this one   this actually does taste like cherry pie but does taste like the filling of a cherry pie  i bet if they were to add cashews it would lend more of a buttery crust like taste but maybe not   while this is a nice change every once in a while it is not one that i would get excited over   very tart but i love the ratio of nuts they used chocolate chip cookie dough  0 stars  and yes i can give zero stars if i want   this bar i took a bite out of and was so turned off by the taste   way way too sweet due to the chocolate chips used   i love the larabars because of the no added sugar but by them adding chocolate chips which contain way too much sugar in my opinion really ruined this bar   if it were not for the chocolate chips i think that it would have been better   unsweetened cocoa powder would have been better   if you like almost candy bars but want a healthier option then you would like this one cashew cookie  5 stars for this bar   this i was worried about trying because i am not really a fan of cashews to begin with but i want to try all of these bars  most of them anyways   i was so surprised at how scrumptious this bar was   it was not too sweet at all and the cashews lend such a wonderful almost buttery like flavor   there is no added salt but i felt as though there was a nice saltiness to this bar   this is my second most favorite after the peanut butter cookie larabar   i like this one on days when i do not want any strong flavors and nothing too sweet and this one fits the bill   i have never had a cashew cookie or heard of them but i can imagine they wouldn t be as good as this bar i plan to try more so i will update this review soon  some amazing  some not so amazing   ,1,0

762,i ve found there is a quality difference between twining s and other brands   i hadn t noticed that much of a difference until i happened to buy another brand of earl grey from a local grocery store  and found the oil content of the flower  burgamet  from italy that is used to give the tea that distinctive flavor was too strong   in the other brand  i will not disparage the other brand name   the oil content was so high as to occasionally upset my stomach   with twining s the content is perfect and i do not have the problem  even after consuming several cups of the morning it still has the distinctive flavor  but just not as strong  i m glad i picked the twining s brand,1,0

685,tried this coffee based pretty much on the assumed introductory price   i was a little skeptical about trying this product based on the reviews  due to the explosion issues   reviewers didn t rave on the taste too much however   so after receiving these cups  i gave one a whirl  and had no problems brewing it   i did notice that the box that they were packaged in could use some  might i say  environmental saving upgrades  and the box itself was a bit rough shod   also i examined a few of the k cups and there seems to be a vacuum issue with them   some looked as if they were ready to blow up right in my hand  as they were so full of air  or whatever it is inside them  they were like a balloon that when over blown with air  it could explode in your face at any second   the others seemed like they had no air or nitrogen or what ever inside  cups could be squished and squeezed and the foil top would just waffle back and forth   so that seems to be another quality control issue  with the vacuum packing and sealing process  perhaps that may lead to the product quality itself once made in the cup   i really don t think i have had the same consistent taste with one of these cup yet   my first cup was rather weak  as in it tasted like i had run twice as much water through it than i should have   really had a watered down taste   the following few cups weren t much different   i am using a controlled amount of water  but the consistency of the coffee that gets filtered into the cup seemed to be all over the place   there have been a couple of cups that seemed to be almost  just right  but still on the weak side  given this is supposed to be a medium roast   i mean  i ve had medium blends that taste like french roast  but this i would really have to classify as a very light roast too light for me  so i m sure if i re order  i ll try a stronger blend that being said  i think these guys at brooklyn roasting co  are on the right track  and i do hope they can find a way to keep the price down   if so  and assuming i can find the right roast for me  i might stick with them for a while   if the price goes up  where it s tooth to tooth with the big boys  i m afraid the big boys will win me out update 8 15 12  well  just when i thought this problem with exploding cups was solved   boooom    coffee grounds everywhere   yes  it happened to me    i m trying to insert a photo  if i can figure that out  i m pretty confident though that this will be my last purchase of these brooklyn k cups   it s one thing to have a passion to go after a piece of the k cup pie  but if you can t do it right  don t do it at all   this company  based on several buyers and reviews  even before i happened on to these  cheaper  cups  had plenty of chances to get it right  apparently amazon or this company will not allow additional photos  as i tried to post an image of the exploded cup sitting in my machine   my guess is they would have far too many photos of the dastardly messes update 9 03 12   ok  based on the fact that this company is serious about hanging in there  and making things right with their customers  i am giving these guys another  college try    after the exploding cup  they very graciously sent me replacement cups   i did not ask that they be replaced  or demanded that they redeem themselves  i merely reported the problem  along with a photo  and next thing i knew  they were asking me for more info  about the product that i had  and then told me they would send some replacements  again  i did not solicit these  but a few days later  a very generous offering was delivered to me   i am really excited to try out all of the other flavors now  as the sent a sample box of several different flavors   my wife and i have already tried a couple of the new flavors and so far they were quite good   my wife really liked the vanilla blend  and wants me to order a box of that alone   i had the french roast  and thought it was pretty good as well   the cups performed nicely and i m looking forward to trying all of the others so i suppose that as i am always willing to give things another shot  i really think that this company is truly trying to deliver a great product  and is doing the right thing by taking care of it s customers  one cup at a time the only thing i m still a little skeptical about is the pricing seems to be creeping up  closer to that of the big brothers in the business   i was really hoping that they could keep them below  50 cents a cup  but are already surpassing that   pricing will be they main drive factor for me if these cups provide consistent and equally good or better coffee to that of the original players all that being said  i m upgrading the star factor   thanks brooklyn for taking care of me   that was unexpected  but very welcome  worth another try   update to previous reviews ,1,0

741,first of all  i would like to comment on the previous review for this item   the customer gave it rave reviews but said that the gum came with a  grainy coating  that s horrible   of course its horrible   its a special type of sand   you are not supposed to eat the sand  you have to rinse off each piece before you use it   the sand is a testiment to the excellent quality of the product   for over 3 000 years  the gum has been harvested the same way   the trees are scared and the  sap  drips down to the ground   the ground is covered by harvesters with a special  clean  white sand to keep the  sap  from becoming dirty when it hits the ground   after it hardens into  teardrops   it is then collected mastic gum kills bacteria that cause plaque and other dental problems   whitens teeth   and it tastes absolutely natural    similar to the way patchouli smells  hard to find item     great value     excellent quality,1,0
740,i chose this brand since others were saying how hard and chewy they are   i ve had the opposite  mine were very soft  like a soft gummy bear    gummy bears i ve had have been firmer   the fruit flavor bursts in your mouth  leaves behind a sweetness in your mouth even after chewing and swallowing   i bought these since my blood sugar drops rapidly and these are quick to grab and easy to chew   you can taste the difference of each flavor but i like eating about 3 mixed flavors together  very fruity   very soft,1,0
739,i am impressed with the quality of this product and will definitely be ordering more  i used to grow and harvest my own  but since i have moved to the tropics and now buy it  i have been disappointed until now   think i found my new supply  yeah   ,1,0
716,okay  so this must be a sort of hybrid gatorade monster sunny delight offspring   it contains lots of vitamin c  other vitamins  40 mg of natural caffiene  taurine  10 mg   and electorlytes  and you mix it all into a glass of water   convenient  very   i hated it but my teenage son loves it   it tastes like kool aid to me  but he likes it when he goes on a walk  mixed in his water   one bottle has 24 servings to mix in  goodness  what would happen if you didn t read the instructions   yikes    so this little bottle could conceivably last awhile   and  it s better than buying 24 separate bottles of vitamin water  too much plastic   so i m rating it good for convenience and the idea itself  but a better flavor would be nice   at least it s not gritty like some water supplements   because this is liquid  it blends very well   wait   okay  bumping it up to a four star   this is pretty handy  peps up water with caffiene  vitamins  and electrolytes,1,0
713,the delivery man laughed when he shook the box and i told him it was  macaroni  but  oh  yes  these are worth ordering online   they are toothsome and flavorful   i was reminded how flavorful recently when i mixed in with these the last of a box of another pasta   in the bowl  the differences were obvious   compared to these  the other pasta was mushy and flavorless an added bonus   when i did the math and with free prime shipping  these were the same price they would be in the supermarket if we could get them here  my favorite boxed pasta,1,0
717,was a little tricky to set  and i had absolutely no faith in the product  however  it worked    i had one false trip the first week   than a week later i saw it was tripped again  so i assumed it was another false alarm  but no    i dug up the area and found a dead mole   sorry i had to kill him  but he had to go    great product   i couldn t believe it  but it worked  ,1,0
712,could never figure out why some teas are green   then the answer came to me on a back country road  there was a bright light  swirling wind and some odd creatures   they told me why and now i know  tea from mars,1,0
711,yes  it s fake syrup  and it s made with splenda  that being said  this is way better than any of the other caramel flavored coffee syrups i ve tried  especially torani  classic caramel    yuck    i don t even like the caramel frappucinos at starbucks anymore  and i think it s because this caramel is so much better  i like to open the bottle and let my friends sniff it  it has a rich butterscotch smell  i mix this syrup with cold brew coffee and milk  delicious i have never found this syrup anywhere except on amazon  i wished i would not have to buy 3 bottles at a time  but i ended up giving two away to my envious friends  so now i am back to order more  yum  actually smells like caramel ,1,0
719,havahart critter ridder 3146 animal repellent  5 pounds granular shaker  this product was easy to apply and blends right in with the ground and dirt  there appears to be less chipmucks and cats around  finally the skunk has left from under our pool deck  we have tried many things and this is the first one that has worked  their is very little odor from this product even after it rains  this product won t hurt the animals but does discourage them from coming around  havahart critter ridder 3146 animal repellent  5 pounds granular shaker,1,0
720,we have a vegetable garden   tomatoes  cucumber  basil  parsley  rosemary  and mint   i have seen woodchucks  deer and a groundhog munching on my garden   we have tried several things in the past to deter them   the rosemary actually worked to deter the deer  but the woodchucks and groundhog kept coming back this stuff smells terrible   like a very strong black pepper   we shook it around the perimeter of our 25 x 15 garden   we reapply after each rainstorm   after a week of use  we have not seen any more woodchucks or groundhogs   they were previously daily visitors so  i would say that this works   however  it need to be reapplied often  certainly after any rain    it is quite an expensive solution  seems to work for deer  woodchucks and groundhogs,1,0
721,about a year ago  a female groundhog burrowed underneath my front porch  until i did a little online research  i didn t know just how annoying and destructive these rodents can be  among other names  these critters are also called woodchucks and whistle pigs  having one of these near your foundation  and my basement  makes getting rid of them extremely difficult  according to online  experts   the usual extricating methods are putting a water hose down the burrow or pumping carbon dioxide in from the exhaust pipe of your vehicle  of course for my situation these methods are neither practical nor safe for the house or the occupants  so  short of catching her outside the burrow when she happens to be out for a stroll or foraging for a snack  what could i do critter ridder  manufactured by havahart  caring control for pets and wildlife   i m not making this up  seemed like my only solution  the company claims that their product is  the  1 selling multi species animal repellent on the market   the product i obtained came in a 5 pound jug and  according to the label  the granules repel skunks  groundhogs  chipmunks and raccoons  further information in the small print on the back indicate this can also be used to discourage domestic pets  like dogs and cats  from coming into your yard  flowerbeds  tagging your property  and damaging your lawn  gardens and other mischief the label also stated that the formula is  patented   proven technology  and sounded like just what i needed  it came with an  adjustable shaker spout and a comfort grip handle  each application is only good for  up to  30 days and must be reapplied for maximum effectiveness  the instructions are very explicit that gloves must be used when applying  the printed red sticker on the label  can be seen in the product photo  had a curious claim   2 5x more  than 2 lbs     though i didn t expect there would be math involved  i soon realized this was a mildly clever  but completely unnecessary way of letting prospective customers know that this jug contained   2  times more granules than their 2 pound jug  in plain english  the seal affirmed that the jug i had contained a full 5 pounds of granules  some advertising is just plain unnecessary after filling the hole with as much dirt as it would allow  i sprinkled the havahart granules in the opening and around the burrow according to the instructions on the container  every good burrow has a backdoor  so i did the same with that exit  since it is spring  almost summer   this is a popular time for rodents to emerge from a long winter hibernation and stock up on food  i sprinkled the product about a month ago and so far there is no signs of any activity  either digging in or out of her burrow  aka  my home    which is a thumbs up for this product  so far caution  when i opened the box containing the jug of critter ridder  i noticed that the lid had a built in pop up spout for pouring out the ingredients  the label on the container has the expected number of cautionary statements on concerning hazards to exposed skin  eye  clothing and domestic animals  one thing i also noticed there was no protective seal on the cap and spout  also  after screwing off the cap in search of a safety seal  i noted that there was a seal over the opening of the jug  but the seal was broken and some of the contents were missing  i doubt that this is the manufacturer s fault  i was probably sent a used container from amazon com  i will take that up with them and this discovery will not factor in my product rating  i do think  however  if the manufacturer would put an external seal over the outside of the cap  with a warning not to use product if the seal is broken  it would go a long way in preventing this kind of mistake  in the case of my package  there could have been a spill inside the box during shipment i plan to add periodic updates to this review as postscripts to provide a complete picture of this products effectiveness over time  critter ridder  caring control for pets and wildlife,1,0
710,for the last 12 years i have colored my hair religiously every 3 months  for the last 11 years i spent countless dollars on salon products and finally decided that their has to be other products that work as well if not better  i am surprised i liked this shampoo as much as i did because i have been using sulfate free however i did assume that since this was  clear  it was also sulfate free however it is the second ingredient on the list  lathers well  great scent  and leaves my hair soft and silky  color is very vibrant however i will alternate after this bottle finishes back to my sulfate free and then back to this just to change it up  silky hair color vibrant,1,0

725,for those who use senseo machine  i own one    don t buy melitta coffee  packed in the small boxes  those are maid exclusively for their high pressure  coffee maker  called something like  melitta one          however  there is a compatible senseo product that they sell  and it is said so on their site  it looks exactly like senseo bag  as another reviewer already stated before   their high pressure machine will not make the froth like senseo  but it will give you very fine tasting coffee when used with appropriate pods  if i correctly understood their representative on the phone this morning  their phone number is 1 888  635 4882  hope this helps someone  considering what is going on with senseo on the market right now  about melitta and senseo,1,0
726,the picture looks better than the actual product  i ll begin by saying  when i received the package  i was surprised by how cheap the gold colored boxes looked  some of the gold paper was peeled off or scratched  and in some of the boxes the white lining paper was also ripped  showing the gray cardboard underneath  i had thought i could reuse those boxes as gift boxes  because they are pretty sturdy  but i won t because of the scratches and rips  instead of boxes bursting with snacks  each box only contained two to three items  in most cases leaving a lot of empty space  though overall there was plenty of food  it didn t seem like it because of the presentation  no colored tissue paper or anything to make the boxes look fuller the selection and quality of food also varied smoked almonds  i like smoked flavoring but something was off  too strong  they were okay jellie bellies  a medium sized box of them sonoma jack pepper jack cheese  i liked how they were individually wrapped into wedges  aspreader was included  a nice addition angelina s butter cookies  these are just like those danish cookies in the blue tins dill seasoned sourdough pretzel nuggets  much too salty  they could have been so much better if there was less salt raspberry snaps  these were delicious biscuits with rasberry flavored powder and flecks cranberry harvest medley  good because it s an almond cranberry mix  but nothing special fleur del sel caramel popcorn  this was good  the popcorn was crunchy and didn t stick to your teeth three pepper water crackers  went well with the cheese  i liked them savory snack mix  the same as chex mix licorice petites  haven t triedhappy birthday bear  eh  not so cute that i would give it to anyone over 8 years old the serving size of packages like the cranberry medley and savory snack mix  pretzels  licorice and popcorn would only feed about one person overall  i m slightly disappointed  everything seemed kind of cheap to me  rather than gourmet  which is what i was expecting  one would proably do better to make their own gift tower than drop  50 or so on this one  in my opinion  3 5 stars   inconsistent mix of quality in food and packaging,1,0
727,my toddler grandson does not eat too many foods  but will eat some baby food fruits and veggies   however  this did not go over  and he wants nothing to do with it   that being said  it is a good product with organic and healthy ingredients  so i didnt want it to go to waste   i find it helpful to add a spoon or two to his potatoes  and i also make pancakes  adding some of this in place of the liquid   both of those methods work   i think for younger babies starting out  if you introduce this earlier  you will have much better luck   one other thing  i ve seen a few companies try out this packaging  and personally  i don t like it   i find it hard to squeeze out all of the food  and can be messy   it s ok for travel  but otherwise  i wish they would just stick to the glass jar  toddler wont eat this,1,0
728,i bought the dual pack of this item and one of them spilled in shipping  the box arrived smelling of coconut  and full of oil  the oil that i paid for  the seal on the containers need to be improved  however the oil itself was everything promised  smells like you can drink it from the container  product good  packaging needs to be improved ,1,0
729,i loved mother s cinnamon oat crunch   it was my all time favorite cereal   even though i don t like honey  the cereal was sweetened with honey  and feel neutral about cinnamon  the stuff was special and made me look forward to breakfast each morning my grocery store was recently out of cinnamon oat crunch  so i went looking for it online     and discovered a notice on the quaker site that the cereal had been discontinued   what a bummer   then i saw new quaker oatmeal squares and how similar they looked to cinnamon oat crunch in the photo   they even have the tilted heart logo that recently appeared on mother s boxes   here s quaker s replacement  i thought not as good   oatmeal squares are sweetened with sugar instead of honey   somehow  the sugar tastes separate from the cereal  like i took a bland piece of unsweetened cereal and put it in my mouth with a sugar cube   cinnamon oat crunch was all natural  i see no such claim on the oatmeal squares box you can make your own call about which cereal is better for you  i m going to post a user image of the nutrition facts side by side   some areas have improved  others have gotten worse   oatmeal squares are all right for taste  i don t mind them  but they just aren t quite as delightful as cinnamon oat crunch  not your mother s cereal ,1,0
703,hi  i bought the 6 pack from warehouse deals  rice needed sauce to bring up the flavor  perhaps because rice was nearer to expiration date some flavor has been lost over time  otherwise  this item is easy to prepare  1 minute in microwave and done  i would buy again  when package arrived i was out of any asian style sauce  i put bar b que sauce on the rice  tasted okay  a healthy food choice  i am very satisfied with this product  healthy and easy to prepare ,1,0
737,i should have read the description better   the ingredients list is accurate  i just didn t read it before ordering   my bad   it s not white tea with orange and cloves  it s white peony with orange  cloves and some other ingredients   if you are looking for a white tea blend  keep looking   however  it is good tea   it s a little heavy on the cloves for my taste   i bought two different teas from this company and the package on the other one resealed just fine   the zipper seal on my particular bag of this  doesn t reseal properly  no big deal  i am happy with the packaging overall  not white tea  heavy on the cloves ,1,0
736,the tea is great   however never buy from this company supplement warehouse   horrible horrible horrible took eleven days to ship    not receive   ship  i love the tea and when the time comes will order again  not from this place though  the tea is smooth and tasty  i def feel its effects   very calming  great tea   horrible customer service,1,0
735,okay  no matter what treat i bring her  sausages  hot dogs  pork hide  she always takes these first i don t know why  but she prefers them over any other  my dog is a mix between a labrador  and a black retriever she s 6 months old i guess she loves to chew on her food  these treats are dried meat  chicken hide  and other things  they re not dry or hard  but more like chewy hard leather my wife tried to taste it  she says she does not understand why the dog likes these  as they are flavorless a bag like this lasts us almost 5 months whether or not they are made in china  or elsewhere  i really don t care my dog loves them  and they re tested by the food agency and inspection if they pass the food inspection agency of the usa  they can get imported  and will be sampled regularly  if they are found unsafe  they will be recalled  usually you will be aware within a few weeks  to a few months  by that time you may have given her only upto a quarter of the bag to many it may sound like you ve poisoned your dog  but that s not true chances are very small you ll get your dog sick as long as you don t feed her this instead of food  only give one or two to her a day as a treat  the levels of toxication are far below anything dangerous there are people freaking out that they might kill their dog  and perhaps  there is a 20  chance that your dog will die of cancer in the future because of this treat you gave her  but then perhaps that cancer could come from a barbecued hotdog too so either way  i m not too worried about it  as long as it looks safe  isn t full of fungus or maggots  or weird colors  and it passes the food administration service  i m fine with this again  if you keep these to a maximum of 2  3  maybe 4 treats a day for a large dog  the chances of intoxication are so low  that they are virtually non existent my dog s happy with them  and i m happy with them  i add them as a variety to the other treats she gets  like pork hide  cookies  and chew sticks  made in china  or not  my dog loves them ,1,0
704,i m giving this four stars because the flavor isn t offensive and there s no aftertaste  it also is not loaded up with sugar however  i have no idea if this is actually beneficial to one s health or actually does what it is advertised to do if you like to flavor your water with somehing that s not sugary  this is an attractive option   i can also see it being a desirable additive to your water that you take on a bike ride or to the gym  not bad  not sure if it really works,1,0
734,my sister bought this for her 2 weims who are both aggressive chewers  i ve never seen toys destroyed so fast  they both love this toy and it lasts quite awhile   i decided to buy one for my husky  it s one of his favorites often played with  it is a hard thick plastic toy with some weight to it  my dog and my sister s dogs  they all have chewed the crap out of it to the point it doesn t look like a dinosaur anymore  oh and they constantly carry it around with them and drop it on your toes  ummm yeah ouch the one drawback  and warning  of this toy is that the teeth marks left in it can cause sharp or rough edges  some fragments are chewed off and left on the floor   however  i still give it 5 stars or should i say 5 paws    i already bought a 2nd one to keep on hand once i m ready to throw the old one in the trash  one of my dog s favorite toys   ,1,0
770,at first i was a little sad to see how small the container was and thought  is this really a pound    well it is  and so far it has made tons of sprouts and hardly put a dent in the bottle of seed  the flavor on these is great and tastes way better than the crap you get at the grocery store  also if you keep them in the fridge in a sealed container with a paper towel underneath them  they last at least a week without getting slimy  they usually don t last that long though  this makes a ton of sprouts ,1,0
706,kids love it  no mess  great for travel  zoo  store  park  everywhere  lid screws on off  doesn t have to be refrigerated  no mess ,1,0
732,i really like the flavor of the strideforever fruit  the stride 2 0 still has a good flavor  but it does not last as long as the old gum did   i don t know why they had to mess around with a good product  i started ordering it here when i couldn t get it in the stores any more  i have been pleased with the service i ve received from the sellers  not as good as the old gum,1,0
707,i have been sampling a number of 70  dark chocolate bars recently and this is as good as any i have tasted  plus it is organic   however i would urge anyone who wants to try this product to check your local grocer first   i bought mine at my local publix supermarket and it was much cheaper than any price on amazon   the same is true for lindt and ghirardelli chocolate   plus no shipping charges  great 70  dark chocolate,1,0
731,so  there really is nothing wrong with this product   i didn t buy it because i m avoiding sugar  it would be healthy of me to cut back  of course and i am trying  i bought it because it s made from coconut and that sounded delicious  exotic and new   i gave it four out of five stars because it doesn t wow  me i love trying new foods  especially ones that i can use in baking   since i ve had this coconut sugar i have used it in the following things 1   green onion naan   naan is a yeasted bread  so i only needed two teaspoons of sugar to speed up the proofing stage  i subbed coconut sugar for the reg granulated sugar and the naan turned out just like they always do  puffy and flavorfull 2   on a bowl of oatmeal   again it tasted just the same  possibly because i included a liberal sprinkling of cinnamon and nutmeg  the subtleties of the sugar might have been overpowered by the spices 3   mixed into a cup of tea with cream   ughh  something was not right  but then again  i use white sugar in my tea  never brown  so maybe the effect would have been the same    tea dumped down the sink 4   in a pan of green curry chicken   the curry tasted like it always does  yummy i guess if you are thinking of buying this because you imagine it will impart a subtle coconut fragrance to your food  think again  i thought it tasted just like brown sugar  so tasty and sweet  but nothing new   as for the health benefits  well  that i am unsure of   i don t believe it would be any safer for diabetics than a spoonful of sugar  nice product  tastes like brown sugar but smells different,1,0
708,i saw all the reviews  both positive   negative and decided to take a chance  ordered this with a new popper  when i received it i proceeded to make a batch of     chewy popcorn thought it may be from new popper so made another batch 2 days later with the same results what a disappointment  i bought the air popper and this popcorn to get away from microwave popcorn only to get stale popcorn the return policy is vague for a product like this  when you proceed through the steps of returning it  your only option is to return for a refund  no replacements or exchanges  i d rather just get another  fresh   container of this popcorn still can t believe they only had a small strip of tape from the lid to the container with no seals of any kind  how is this product supposed to stay fresh if it isn t properly sealed update  i was put in contact with their customer service and they promptly shipped out another container of popcorn  although it was more fresh than the first container  it still seems to have quite a few chewy pcs of popcorn in each batch popped  maybe i m spoiled from eating microwave popcorn for so long when i finish this container i m going to try a smaller sized container from a different manufacturer and see if there s any difference  was  another stale sob story ,1,0
709,i find the small  28 ounce ones to be more stringy and chewier  similar flavor and still edible so it s okay  i would definitely buy the larger sticks though  okay but not the same as the larger ones,1,0
730,this is not a health drink  unless you count energy boost and a clear mind as being essential to combating stress   i combine coffee and tab for a double whammy  old time favorite  not available in stores anymore,1,0
733,i had earlier bought a box of timothy s 50 breakfast blend kcups and not only got a great tasting coffee  but fast shipping  at the time  timothy s was the only seller i found that sold in this large amount  so i bit the bullet and paid the  7 95 shipping  the kcups arrived in 3 days and i didn t have a single problem with any of them when it came time to buy more  i reordered from timothy s again  after waiting and waiting and getting down to 3 kcups  i came back to amazon to see if my favorite breakfast blend from green mountain was available in the 50 kcup size  it was  and i jumped on it because i really didn t want to go to town to buy a small box while waiting the kcups i ordered from amazon came 2 days later  still no timothy s box in sight  it finally arrived today  10 days after the original order  to say i m disappointed in this is an understatement there are two reasons i m returning the timothy s coffee  1  i got the green mountain 50 kcup pack considerably cheaper than the timothy s coffee  in fact  when i ordered the green mountain kcups i also ordered some apple cider kcups  2 boxes of 24 each for my husband and between them it was less than a  1 more then the timothy order  2 since i got the first box i ordered from them in 3 days  i feel i had a reasonable expectation of something similar with this new order  i wasn t even able to track the package  i m not sure why that was  maybe because it came from canada   so i had no idea when it would arrive  on top of that  they are not only making me pay for returning the box  they could also take a 20  restocking fee  but that s ok  they ll only get it this one time i gave this a 4 star rating because the coffee really is great if you re looking for a medium blend coffee that doesn t remove your taste buds  unlike many other reviewers  i didn t have any problems at all with any defective kcups  as much as i love the coffee  the price and iffy shipping times doesn t lend themselves to repeating the experience  very disappointed in  timothy s,1,0
832,i didn t mean to order a 40 pound bag  but i did  wow  that s a lot of food  be sure to mix it with protein or else you dog will suffer a bit of internal distress  sojos original,1,0
771,i received many different flavors and lollie styles from kendon candies and there was not one disappointed student in any of the classes they were delivered to  the older students favorites were the mystery flavored and the younger ones loved the twists  it was a carnival atmosphere when they were delivered and the anticipation was overwhelming because they were coming from the oldest candy factory in the usa  they were not disappointed  neither was i thank you kate  perfect lollies ,1,0
682,i to was totally and utterly distraught by the open ended chocolate twists i thought  how dare they turn my favorite twizzlers candy into such an abomination     i would sneer and grumble at the open ended ones every time i passed them in the store it s nice that some big companies listen to their consumers  the classic closed end twists are the best  i hope they stop making the open ended ones completely  thank the gods   ,1,0
676,i purchased this primarily as breakfast for my girlfriend  who is under strict orders from her doctor to get her sugar intake down  this is always a challenge  since she detests artificial sweeteners  as a compromise strategy  this product succeeds very well  as the boxes clearly explain  the normal sugar content for quaker oats cereal is 11 12 grams per packet  this product has a third of that  except for the apples and cinnamon flavor  which is half   an artificial sweetener  sucralose  makes up for any lost sweetness some reviewers mark this product down for misrepresentation  the product s packaging is actually quite clear and explicit about the ingredients  and while amazon presents less information  i had a pretty good idea of what i was getting as far as my girlfriend  she loves this stuff  she was practically ripping open the boxes before i even had a chance to unpack and organize things  each flavor is very distinctly sweet  but not cloyingly so  the oatmeal is pleasingly coarse rather than creamy or mushy  the flavors are correct  i m not a fan of oatmeal  and i still plan on getting more just for myself each packet is suitable for a child  we use two packets each for breakfast  that means the bundle of four boxes contains about 24 adult meals  be sure to heat the water or milk sufficiently in making this  otherwise  the oatmeal won t soak up the liquid  and it will be too goopy so far as the rating   well  the one star reviewers  only 2 of 5 of whom are verified amazon purchasers  have made their point  but this is not a one star product  it s a quality four or five star product  and a great deal under amazon s subscription plan  excellent for adults who want to reduce sugar intake,1,0
806,i bought this because i enjoyed it at school  even though i like what i bought from amazon  it is not as sparkling as what i drank in high school  not as sparkling,1,0
675,good chips but i bought them because i was looking for chocolate chips with no soy  after reading the product ingredients on amazon and assuming they were soy free since soy was not listed i was very disappointed to find soy listed on the package when i got my order  i have 3 bags of chips that i can t use  again  they are good chips but they are not soy free  not soy free,1,0
674,i ve only used this a few of times and it seems to have had an effect i never had dandruff falling on my clothes but  don t be grossed out here  when i d scratch my head  i d have debris under my fingernails   since i ve been using this  my scalp doesn t itch as much and when i do scratch  there s less dry skin debris wow  i sound like big foot s sister   ha    but that s life my hair is also soft and not as dry   so   less scalp itching because my scalp is cleaner and nicer hair   it works        works,1,0
807,a lot is being made of the sugar content here  and it s quite overblown  this coconut water has a fraction of the sugar of a can of soda  so to say it hurts your teeth is dishonest at best  neither is the sugar content a big secret  the ingredients are plainly listed in the product photos  if you want a no sugar added product  look elsewhere  that market is crowded enough to meet your needs so why opt for samu  if you can t kick the sugary drinks but want to cut back  this is a great soda substitute  it s very smooth and drinkable but the reason i bought it   what this company is really advertising this product for   is as a mixer  this mixed very well with rum  instead of a rum and coke  try a rum and samu  tequila makes for an interesting mix  ordinarily you d pair sour with tequila  not sweet  but give it a try  it s pretty good  i m not a vodka drinker  but my friends had good things to say this is not a typical mixer you would see at a party  it gets people talking  i look forward to experimenting more with it  an alternative mixer and soda substitute,1,0

673,i have been using this stuff for over 12 years now  used to be able to get it locally around seattle when i lived there  living in central ohio now i hate seattle   i cant find it anywhere so i have to order it online not a big deal though  still worth it   why spend 5  for a white mocha at starbucks which in my opinion doesn t even taste as good as the ones i make at home with this white chocolate powder  you do the math  i have tried the ghirardelli white chocolate sauce but i still like the powder more i don t know if the ghirardelli chocolate premium hot beverage mix  white mocha is the same as this white chocolate powder or not  i saw one reviewer say they were different  if anyone knows  let me know this with smuckers caramel syrup 2 50  and the 40  mr coffee espresso maker and 20  mr coffee grinder optional   you re set  better then starbucks white mocha,1,0
672,wolf  chili with beans  15 ounce cans  pack of 24 i like this product  and i ll continue to buy it  unless and until i find something better  having said that  i m not quite satisfied with it in one respect  its hotness  or lack thereof  i like my chili hot  and this chile fails in that department  unfortunately  i m not a cook  and my attempts to  spice it up  have not yet worked  but i ll keep trying  so far i ve tried powdered chili  and ground up fresh jalapeno chile  but i didn t like the results  i know that there must be some percentage of some kind of additional hotness that will make it perfect  but i haven t found it yet  something to look forward to one more thought on my personal  hotness  meter  at one point i did read the label to make sure that it contained chile  i really hadn t been sure about that  but it does  i ll be buying another case of it ,1,0
810,i see my review is pretty much in agreement with another review here  but i ll put it here anyway i ordered this along with pero extra and roastaroma to try the three  i m a former postum aficionado and had certainly developed quite a liking to postum really can t take pero extra very much  i keep trying it again and again  prolly 10 times now  to see if i can develop a liking for it and just can t  i m sure some people may like it  but it s just not for me cafix is what i ll usually go for  but it has a certain sort of built in sweetness  very mild  barely distinguishable which comes from the beets that are added  over time i ve found it just sort of fills in some of the void from lack of postum  and while it s not a postum replica it has certain postum like qualities the roastaroma actually is what i think tastes the best of the three  but it s taste is just not at all like postum  is however very balanced and has a nice maltiness to it  often i ll put just a little bit of stevia powder in it   i could always tell if i ve ingested aspartame by  or nutrasweet  whatever  by how i felt  and try to verify any food drink i ingest doesn t have aspartame  i mean  an item which arose out of research into nerve agents for warfare  and itself found to be an effective weapon  really shouldn t be passed off as a food item  stevia is ground plant matter  even less processed that sugar  the combo makes a really nice morning or late evening drink  close but not postum,1,0
811,i m not a water drinker and have to force myself to drink it  i constantly look for ways to supplement plain water to make it more palatable so decided to try this product if you are looking for a healthy additive  this does give you vitamins and minerals that water lacks  however  that said there are a lot of additives and as you can see by the ingredient listings  water  is the first ingredient water  citric acid  vitamin c  natural flavor  sucralose  natural caffeine  sodium benzoate  potassium sorbate  magnesium lactate  vitamin b3  vitamin b6  calcium lactate  potassium phosphate  vitamin a  palmitate  vitamin e  vitamin b6  vitamin b12the directions say to do a one squeeze into 8 ounces of water  i didn t really care for it in plain water  seemed a bit metallic to me  not overwhelming  but nothing to make me want to gulp water all day  i drink a lot of tea  sparkling soda and crystal light type products so i ended up using it in pitchers of crystal light and sparkling water  it was very good used that way and of course you feel good thinking you are getting vitamins with your aspartame based drinks  i tried the fruit punch supplement in raspberry tea  but lets just say  not so good finally  i can t say i noticed any extra energy descending upon me  but i like the fact that this provides some vitamin intake i might not otherwise get during my liquid imbibing  great vitamin mineral additive,1,0

668,these seriously tastes like peanuts to me  they leave the same dry feeling in my mouth  it stops me from eating too many  i like these though because they don t taste as heavy as peanuts  but these are really dry  they are really crunchy but not teeth chipping hard  i suppose it really depends on what you like  it definitely does not taste anything like what fresh edamame tastes like  tastes like peanuts to me,1,0
813,i ve tried this brand as well as the  cento  dop certified  grown in italy  san marzano  and i m sorry to say  i do not see any difference in flavor  san marzano is a type of tomato  it is not a locale of where they re grown frankly  i almost prefer this brand over the cento brand because these tomatoes come pre crushed  this means i don t have to get my hands or a potato masher in there and start tearing up the tomatoes to make them blend inwith the sauce maybe if someone is a purist and can honestly distinguish these from san marzano tomatoes that have been imported from italy  then they can keep buying the more expensive  imported  tomatoes but i just don t see the point in spending  1 50 or more per can to buy  the real thing  when there s no discernible difference in flavor or taste sorry  i just don t feel like belly aching over something so trivial  i m baking the pizza for myself and my family  not running a restaurant or trying to satisfy italian quality laws i think the dop designation is over rated  i m also not cooking my pizza in a wood burning oven  so what difference does it make how  authentic  the tomatoes are  these tomatoes are just as good as any others  i didn t give them five stars because while i don t see them as being inferior to  the real thing   i also feel that i can make my own tomato sauce that tastes every bitas good as the san marzano canned tomatoes  so  while these tomatoes aren t bad  they re aren t perfect either  i ve yet to find any that are  ok  so they re not grown in italy   ,1,0

805,i grew up in germany in a rather poor household  the rare moment there was enough money to getsweet extras like gummibears where rare and far apart imagine how happy i was when i found out that there are gumibears  and even the one and only haribo are available in the us funny is  that most of the gummy you find in the us are made in turkey  haribo is an old german company  i really dont mind where they make them as long as there are as yummy as they were when we were kids unfortunately  the ones i got weren t that fresh  i dont say there were old  or bad  but do you know what i mean a fresh bear  is soft  feels almost wet  yumm  these were  a bit dry on the outside not as soft and just not as yumm but still enjoyable unfortunately i went trough only half the pack  then i found out that i am diabetic   not a fault of the gummi bears  what is not to love about them ,1,0

817,these say dark chocolate  however  they are actually covered in dark cocoa  first thought  they were not what i thought they should have been but the taste was good  mostly almond taste  just be aware  only dark cocoa covered but they are good  nice low calorie snack healthy too ,1,0
667,i usually drink about twelve 12 oz coke zeros a day  however the aspartame is bad for your diet   diet colas are worse for you than regular colas   so i switched to 5 hour energy to replace the caffeine   i also have crohn s disease   this disease causes me to have a vitamin b12 deficiency  which i normally have to buy and give myself an injection for   not anymore   5 hour energy gives me 8333   not a typo  of my daily allowance for b12  and also provides another crucial element that my body has a difficult time getting   folic acid   both of these are essential to the human body   so  not only do i get jacked up from the 5 hour energy  it counters some of the effects of my crohn s disease by providing me with crucial elements and energy that otherwise are drained by this disease   i am not a doctor  but i did stay at a holiday inn express last night  and drank 5 hour energy while i was there  works within minutes,1,0

821,i purchased several assorted jars of mrs  renfro s salsa products and will review them as we go through the jars   the first one we ve opened is mrs  renfro s habanero salsa hot    16 oz and it s better than average but not knock your socks off jarred salsa   initially  the sauce was very thin in consistency  but after refrigeration  it thickened a bit   nevertheless  this is definitely not home made fresh type salsa  it is a jarred and prepared in large batch salsa product   at the cost of a couple dollars at the store  we were not dissatisfied  but i wouldn t pay more for this   there are a few mushy tomato chunks in the product  so it s not totally smooth   the heat is intense but lasts only briefly  so if you re looking for lingering heat  i d recommend another salsa   for a quick jolt of habanero  this is very good and worthy of a four star review   i ll compare it to the other mrs  renfro salsa products as they are tasted  saucy and hot for a moment or two,1,0
822,my dogs love these things and i ve purchased from this seller many times with great results   i ve only used 2 of the sticks so far and they do seem to have an odor to them  not too much of a big deal but normally they are pretty much right on with the no odor   they aren t awful as some i ve tried   will continue to purchase from this seller  bully sticks,1,0
823,you need to add enough syrup to have the right flavor  the flavor is decent and nothing is offending in the ingredient list  it has fructose  not high fructose corn syrup  they are different  if you crave for root beer sometimes  this will work    i still will buy small batch brewed all sugar root beer when i see them in store  it taste ok  dont expect it to be like craft brew beer,1,0

826,took me years to find the ultimate chewing gum  but when i found wrigley s orbit white peppermint the search ended  i ve been chewing this gum for many years now  i occasionally try something else  but nothing ever wins  the peppermint in this gum can wipe out the worst of bad breath  and toward the end of its chewable life  it doesn t start to taste awful or give you worse breath as many gums will do  it simply loses its flavor only drawbacks  i usually chew 2 pieces at a time  so they are a bit small and  2 they just changed the packaging  it used to fit nicely in your back pant pocket  inside suit jacket pocket etc  now its twice as thick and poorly layed out so it s bulky  not sure why they had to change  probably to do with retail stores layout  this won t prevent me from buying it  but it s really annoying  wrigley  just never change the flavor  the best bad breath and no fowl after taste,1,0
827,not a really drinker  don t keep booze in the house   that said   every once in a while i get in the mood for a libation    always liked a long island iced tea but to make one requires buying 1 2 a liquor store s worth of clears   gave this a shot   for like  12 bucks in a big 1 75 liter bottle totally on a whim when out to pick up a red wine for guests   how awful could it be   no worse than any of the other pre made cocktails  which is to say  horrible   i ve had   figured if it was terrible  i could mix it with real iced tea to kill the flavor  gotta tellya  not too shabby   totally bested my low expectations   especially at its bottom shelf price and cheap azz plastic bottle   have certainly had worse out at places that apparently don t know how to make a proper long island iced tea  put this in a tall iced filled glass with a lemon wedge   good to go  as always with recommendations  ymmv  but this will be purchased again  not bad at all,1,0

829,i guess on it s own it deserves 5 stars  but because i bought it as a potential replacement for postum  which it doesn t mimic in flavor or taste  i give it a 4 i ordered this along with cafix and pero extra to try the three and find an acceptable substitute for postum  i m a former postum aficionado and had certainly developed quite a liking to postum really can t take pero extra very much  i keep trying it again and again  prolly 10 times now  to see if i can develop a liking for it and just can t  i m sure some people may like it  but it s just not for me cafix is what i ll usually go for  but it has a certain sort of built in slick sweetness  very mild  barely distinguishable which comes from the beets that are added  over time i ve found it just sort of fills in some of the void from lack of postum  and while it s not a postum replica it has certain postum like qualities the roastaroma actually is what i think tastes the best of the three  but its taste is just not at all like postum  it is however very balanced and has a nice maltiness to it  often i ll put just a little bit of stevia powder in it   i could always tell if i ve ingested aspartame by  or nutrasweet  whatever  by how i felt  and try to verify any food drink i ingest doesn t have aspartame  i mean  an item which arose out of research into nerve agents for warfare  and itself found to be an effective weapon  really shouldn t be passed off as a food item  stevia is ground plant matter  even less processed that sugar  the combo makes a really nice morning or late evening drink  tastes great  just not like postum,1,0
830,so  for about the past three months  it s been virtually impossible to get senseo branded pods  so i tried these as an alternative  and i am happy i did  as soon as i tried the first cup of this particular coffee  one word came to mind  strong i am using these in a first generation senseo machine  these pods are much thicker than the senseo pods so you ll need to use the double pod tray  they re packed much tighter than the senseo pods  which also may affect how strong this coffee tasted as long as these pods remain available  i don t think i ll even bother looking for more alternatives  wow  what a coffee,1,0
831,the only reason i didn t give this a 5 star rating is because one of the bottles was busted when i received it   thankfully they were wrapped in a bubble wrap bag  but it wasn t enough to prevent the safety seal under the lid from popping loose  judging by the condition of the box  evidently something heavy was placed on top of my package  and the pressure caused the safety seal to separate from the rim by about 1 4  inch  so i lost about 1oz  of product aside from that  i love the agave  and it s a far better deal than what i can get at a grocery store  please please pack your shipments better        ,1,0

804,what can i say  it is almond milk and it is delicious  the fortified vitamins are their natural forms  not synthetic  so the body can actually use what it needs and discard the rest  it is very low in calories and almond milk itself has a host of benefits  unlike the unhealthy soy products  almond milk does not contain any natural plant estrogen so it will not give men breasts and it will not mess with a woman s time of the month one note as has been said by another reviewer   the picture of the product is wrong  you actually get the 32 ounce aseptic rectangle containers  not the pictured ones  silk makes the best almond milk around,1,0
677,compared to other sardines i ve had over the years  these sardines are the tastiest  the best part is that everything in the container can be eaten   no need to remove bones or look at slimy coatings  the worst part is that the olive oil in the container can make the overall experience feel too oily  be prepared to wash your hands after handling the container  not a bad thing     olive oil is good for your fingernails      my first case will not be my last     as sardines go     delicious ,1,0
678,received order within 7 business days   the product received did not have the same label as pictured though the wording was the same   also the product did not have the same flavor as the product pictured  which we had bought previously locally    i suppose the manufacturer has not only changed the label for this product  but also the recipe   the distributor provided excellent service and we have decided to keep the sauce we received  just have to make our own modifications for our grilled vegetable recipe we have used in the past   thanks for another great distributor for the products we like world harbors jamican style jerk sauce  16 ounce bottle   pack of 6  great service,1,0

775,i purchased this fil eacute  from amazon after not being able to find it in any store near me and let me be the first to say  literally this is the first review  it s a great product  it s by far the best value around on fil eacute   at about 50 cents an ounce  you cant beat it  however  one would think since it s so cheap it would be of poor quality  but this is simply not the case  this fil eacute  is high quality potent stuff  i use a ton of it in my gumbo and nearly a year later  about 6 large pots of gumbo  i still have over half of it left  and that is after i gave my cousin a quart sized container of it  one cannot simply do that if you bought a tiny 6 ounce container of fil eacute   my advice is if you re a creole like me and use a bunch of fil eacute  look no further than this  however  if you re just a casual spice experimenter this may not be for you as fil eacute  has a unique taste and smell that may not appeal to all and this being such a large container it would be a waste should you not like it  i recommend buying a small amount first in order to make a determination note  the container says it will expire about a year from when i bought it  but i have never know fil eacute  to go bad as my mom had the same little jar the entire time i was growing up  you gotta use it quick   according to the manufacturer ,1,0
776,this is a great deal for vapers that want to try diy for the first time  i have been mixing about 1 dram per 25ml of vegetable glycerin  no nicotine  just for fun to see what flavors i like and if it tastes as good as some basic e liquid flavors i have tried  i must point out that this review is for people 18 years or older who have switched to vaping from smoking and want to try diy liquid without committing a lot of money  this 10 pack plus a 5 dollar bottle of vg from wally mart is a great way to get your feet wet and if you make a mistake it s no big deal because of how inexpensive all the materials are  but be careful as not all the flavors are water soluble  do some research and try to get flavors that are mostly made up of propylene glycol    apple  cherry and blueberry are all good examples of this  avoid almond and wintergreen  vaping forums have complete lists for the flavors that are ok to vape  good deal for d i y  vaping fun,1,0
777,got this mixture as the description mentioned a variety of not only coffee types but cocoas  teas  and cider   the box arrived in great packing condition and there were actually 51 cups in the box  4 were limited edition flavors    overall 22 were either teas or decaf coffees   so not a bad mixture  all were in date range and not expired  and no duplicates  two hazelnuts by different companies is not considered a duplicate  for those that would argue it is   different brands bring different tastes and experiences the only reason i cannot give this a 5 star review is that we did not receive  not even one  hot cocoa or apple cider to try   needless to say the wife and kids were disappointed   that was really the main purpose of getting this package  otherwise i would have just bought a coffee variety pack and would have saved me from drinking decaf   oh well  good price for mixture of coffee flavors ,1,0
778,i did notice that even though the main ingredient is corn  my puppy person did not have gas problems and i did not see her eating grass   i will assume it did not upset her stomach i liked the zip lock on the top of the bag   granted  if the bag was full and spilled over  the zip lock wouldn t help and it probably doesn t keep the food fresh because there is still a ton of air in the bag   but  i feel the zip lock keeps out bugs some of the cons of the food are food coloring   really   my puppy person is color blind  another problem was the second ingredient is  chicken by product meal    i guess that means guts   while i have a problem eating guts  my girl does not    she d roll in it if you let her    i just don t see that as being nutritious  which the front of the bag depicts a healthy dog with whole foods around it  my puppy person ate like a pig ,1,0

780,the  original wild  is a bit spicy for me  but  original mild  is spectacular  and teriyaki beef even better  also like the spicy chicken one  i ve tried all the veg jerky products and bewildered that none of the others come even close to this one for quality of flavor and texture  the others are loaded with sugar and taste more like candy than jerky  a couple of them are outright slimy  one was hard as a rock and flavorless  but the only time stonewall s jerquee ever displeased me was when the poulsbo market used a paper punch to create holes along the top edge and hung them on a peg to dry out    which i didn t realize until i got them home and they d all been turned into hard lumps  which i ate any way   so now i have to buy them on amazon  i ll still get the fresh sushi at poulsbo market  that stuff s a dream  but what possessed them to poke holes in packaged foods    my fave veg jerky,1,0

782,this is for happybaby happy tot fruit pouches  these are excellent for kids  my 2 year old loves it  she asks for it every morning and everytime she takes a bath  it s great   totally organic with all natural ingredients and no harmful chemicals  gmo s or preservatives  it does not need to be refridgerated so wont take up space in your fridge  although once it s opened it does  as do most products   it s great for kids at least half a year old and is recommended by the well known dr  sears  tv personality  author  and acclaimed professor at uc irvine the container is well made and does not flap around  it can stand up on its own as it has a base that is round and designed to stand up   other containers will lay flat and leak out when the child puts the pouch down  it also has a brighly colored plastic cap that  before opening for the first time  cannot be removed by a small child  you will need to open it for them  the cap is large enough that small 2 year old hands can manipulate it open and closed without much difficulty  the cap is also color coded to match the packaging design  so you can easily and quickly identify which one you want  likewise  the packaging is colorful and well designed  it shows pictures of the fruit on the side and writing for the adults so you can choose your variety the fruit variety is tasty  i have sampled some of it and found it to be pretty good for smoothies and adult meals  regardless  it s a child s drink  so the focus is on how much the children enjoy it  i find that no child has objected to the flavor  although some flavors certainly get unique   who would want to eat broccoli and pear together  butternut squash and apple is certainly a savory combination  spinach and mango  doesnt matter  my kids love all flavors  sure  some have preferences  but these are great combinations and are supremely healthy speaking of which  i had no clue what salba was  so i googled it       evidently it s a super healthy grain that is an excellent source of omega 3 s  fiber  magnesium  calcium  antioxidants  folate  and dietary fiber  evidently it s also better than chia and flax seeds as well  this all comes from the salba website so it s obviously to be taken with a grain  no pun intended   of salt  but still  that sounds fantastic to me  surely this cant hurt a growing child s system while other reviewers have noted that this product is available for cheaper at target for  1 09 per pouch  i have not been to the target store lately so i cannot verify that  but i did a price comparison on target s online website          again  i did not go into the store   you might be able to find this in the store for cheaper  as of 6 7 12  the cheapest pack was  10 16 cents for spinach  mango and pear  and broccoli  pear and peas  or  20 32 for 16 of them  in my state  we have 6  sales tax   1 22   which turns that total into  21 54 for a 16 pack  or  1 34 per drink  compare that to amazon s price  which is  19 20  no sales tax  for smp and  19 86 for bpp  you can also sign up with subscribe and save  which will yield a 15  discount  or a total of  16 32 for smp  or  16 88 for bpp  that s a savings of  3 44 to  4 total  or over a quarter for each item  green beans  pears and peas sells for  19 52 or  16 59 for s s on amazon  vs   24 25 at target  online pricing  but i added sales tax   which is a  7 66 price difference  again  these are not in store prices  just online prices you should be aware that there is a recall on some happybaby pouches  pay attention to those expiring between november 2010 and january 2011  the press release indicates that nobody has been hurt and no harmful bacterias have been found   http   www fda gov safety medwatch safetyinformation safetyalertsforhumanmedicalproducts ucm197570 htm   in fact  one of my pouches started swelling up  so i threw it out  but my daughter enjoyed the rest of the pouches from that batch  i sampled them to be sure  and was fine  i just assumed it was a bad pouch but now i know that there s a recall  so i will be keeping an eye out  as you should  does not mean you should give these up   there have not been any harmful effects and it appears to be a bad batch which the company has corrected  great for kids  perfect for travel  what s not to like ,1,0

786,we recently bought a snow cone machine for my daughter   i wanted to join in the fun  but i have been on a low carb diet for almost 2 years   i noticed there were a number of manufacturers making sugar free snow cone syrups  but i chose jelly belly because i assumed that they would make a great tasting syrup   i was not dissappointed   this one tasted as good as i have ever tasted a sugar free product   i have since ordered several other of their sugar free flavors   thank you jelly belly  jelly belly knows flavor,1,0
787,just as an fyi  this tea is not caffeine free  no matter what the title on amazon says  if you go to the republic of tea website  it tells you it has caffeine  this doesn t matter to me  but is misleading to those who do not want a caffeinated beverage  not caffeine free,1,0
788,a single  pack of 4  was  2 39  regular price  at a local supermarket yesterday  if i remember correctly  it had an expiration date on it that isn t years into the future  so i don t think i ll buy 6 boxes just to save less than 6 cents per box  price vs supermarket ,1,0
789,these are some of the best pickles i ve ever had  not overly hot but have a bite that won t linger too long  i will be buying more this time it will be the quart and not te small jar  really good,1,0
790,i do not understand the bad review below  the chuckles boxes come to 40 ounces  the chuckles bars are 48 ounces at nearly twice the price  that s right  the boxes cost almost half as much the boxes are big and inside the chuckles are in a plastic bag  yes  they are not evenly distributed  oh  well  great value  big boxes ,1,0
802,i ve tried this brand as well as the  cento   dop certified  grown in italy  san marzano  and i m sorry to say  i do not see any difference in flavor  san marzano is identified as much a type of tomato as where it is grown just as i don t consider a  beefsteak  tomato as being cut from a cow because it has the word  beef  as part of its name frankly  i almost prefer this brand over the cento brand because these tomatoes come pre crushed  this means i don t have to get my hands or a potato masher in there and start tearing up the tomatoes to make them  blend inwith the sauce i m also not cooking my pizza in a wood fired oven  shame on me maybe if someone is a purist and can honestly distinguish these from san marzano tomatoes that have been imported from italy  then they can keep buying the more expensive  imported  tomatoes but i just don t see the point in spending  1 50 or more per can to buy  the real thing  when there s no discernible difference in flavor or taste sorry  i just don t feel like belly aching over something so trivial  i m baking the pizza for myself and my family  not running a restaurant or trying to satisfy italian quality laws these tomatoes are just as good as any others  i didn t give them five stars because while i don t see them as being inferior to  the real thing   i also feel that i can make my own tomato sauce that tastes every bitas good as the san marzano canned tomatoes  so  while these tomatoes aren t bad  they re aren t perfect either  i ve yet to find any that are  ok  so they re not grown in italy   ,1,0
801,i suffer from migraines and this is the only otc gum i have found that does not contain aspartame which is one of my triggers  trident cinnamon is my hero when it comes to gum  only otc gum i can chew,1,0
800,when i ordered my first tin of quality street chocolates i figured it was going to be ok  my dad raved about them so much omg went through them like nothing had to hold on a minute before i ordered the second one and lost but not least the third one gotta slow down addictive  mouth watering good,1,0
679,my daughter would have the worst gas pains and spit up on the newborn formula by enfamil  so my doctor suggested we switch to gentlease   it did the trick   no more huge spit ups   it just makes her poo a weird color and it doesn t taste as good as the regular milk formula  for spit up too   ,1,0
799,i really enjoy this coffee  not too strong  not too weak   and it doesn t leave an after taste   all that said  i decided to buy locally becausee i can get a better price  even the regular price  so i gave it a 4 for the price   also  anyone want to tell me why the 48 count is more expensive than ordering 2 of the 24 count   lol good coffee  bad price,1,0
798,so i walk in the door with this new bag of food  arnold looks at me and telepathically says   damnit  a new bag of food  can t you just stick with the purple bag i like  i say   arnold  see this  this bag was made for german shepherds like you  surely this must be better  arnold crop dusts me with a fart and walks away later when he is hungry  i open the bag and give him his serving  4 cups twice a day for this massive fatty dog   arnold gives it a whiff   hrmm  smells good  i don t trust it  he nibbles  and then takes a mouthful  and then the hoover vacuum in his stomach switches on and literally 3 seconds later it s all gone i think he likes it  the end  arnold is happy,1,0
683,i do warn all that this coffee is quite bitter tasting   personally  i like the bitter taste and so give this four stars   but some might want to pour this in a glass and add some ice cubes to cut the taste  a bit  bitter but refreshing,1,0
797,lipton tea to go is great i love it   the price is about what i paid in the store but this seller is charging shipping on each individual box of tea   i was going to purchase all in stock which was 11 boxes at  2 00 a box should have been  22 00   shipping it was like  66 00 for the order  the pricing is deceiving  shipping each pkg separately,1,0
795,this tea was surprisingly hard to find at the health food store  so i bought it online  reading about possible ways to off set liver damage 2 2 medications  statins in particular   i figured  why not  i drink tea  so i can try this one  it tastes ok  not great  but drinkable i think this tea is a fair alternative to taking another pill  tastes ok  good for ya ,1,0
794,this food color is good for things that are kneaded   it s not as liquid as the description makes it appear  not what i thought,1,0
680,while i am not generally a cereal fan  this one won me over   the different grains had a nice texture to them  even after sitting in milk for a while  and the flavor was great   nice and light vanilla  not way overpowering   my kids even enjoyed eating this straight out of the box  nature s path cereal,1,0
793,i drank the kool ade when it comes to the oral health of pets  i brush my cat s teeth  put this  biotene veterinarian drinking water additive  4 fl oz  in her water  i ve seen some terrible things happen in pet s mouthes  if i can spare my cat that kind of discomfort  i want to do that right now i m fostering a kitten who was feral when she came to me  she won t let me touch her  and there s no way in hell she s going to let me brush her teeth since she s being socialized  she gets treats anytime someone s around her and she s not panicking  naturally i wanted to sneak some dental treats in there  so i ordered a few different kinds to see if i could find one she liked better she likes these ok  but mainly i wanted to comment that they small just like chef boyardee s beefaroni  that smell,1,0
792,i ve ordered about three boxes of a dozen cans of this from amazon by now  each batch has been different  one batch was part liquidy  part solid  the next batch was almost completely solid  and this latest batch is all milky liquid i can use them no matter what the consistency  but it would be nice if thai kitchen had better quality control  i liked the solid batch because i could make a wicked alternative to chocolate mousse with it  you can t do that with the part liquid or all liquid consistency coconut milk  but mostly i use it in smoothies and in curries  so no big deal  i like to buy coconut milk in bulk so i ll continue to order this  i like it but it s inconsistent ,1,0
791,i used to get this brand of seasonning at wal mart were i bought my dehydrater but they no longer sell it and it was only one kind origanal  but this amazon order came in variaty pack much much better  nesco bj 6 jerky spice works  6 pack  original flavorit s a must buy for people who make jerky  i don t make hambuger jery i make it out of cheap cuts of beef when on sale  best jerky seasonning,1,0
796,i guess there are lots of uses for hempseed oil   i use it for the hair  just to keep it down so my hair doesn t look odd with parts sticking up   that s all i use it for  and it works in a cost effective way it smells earthly like ground flax seeds and just like flax it has hint of fish in the smell   that sounds a lot worse than the reality  but just sayin    the smell is not strong at all  unlike many other products i recommend this product for men s hair  for hair  especially for men,1,0
1679,not much to say that people don t already know about the candy so i bought a couple of bags for work they arrived on time and were in perfect condition  not melted smashed the dark chocolate milkyway candy bars weren t the greatest but the rest of the batch were great  coworkers loved them,1,0
955,i admit it  i drink lots of tea and almost no coffee  as a result  i look for quality and value for money  now pg tips are not a premium priced product  but it s much better than what you can find in the typical grocery  buy it and you will not regret it  english tea,1,0
956,i bought this trap approx  a month ago  nothing happened for a month but 2 days ago there were 4 moths laying in the trap glued  it works  they eat my cotton t shirts now i know it s moths  they have done a lot of damage to my favorite ts i will buy more traps  it works  ,1,0
1123,my shih tzus and pekinese really like these chews but they tend to stuff them into their mouth once they re small enough but still too big to swallow   one of my dogs swallowed a big piece then began walking with her back arched   was constipated   another one of my dogs tried to swallow a 2 inch piece and began choking   i had to pry her mouth open and pull it out of her throat   i m just thankful i was home when it happened   i gave the bag to my neighbor who has a big dog and seems to have no problem with the chews  bad for small dogs   choking hazard   good for big dogs,1,0
1124,healthy cereal i love cereal though i rarely eat it as one is supposed to  generally preferring to take a small ziplock of it with me to eat dry as a snack this cereal was perfect for me   it basically tastes like teddy grams without the sugary coating   i was able to eat baggie after baggie of this stuff   i did try a bowl of it with milk  but it had a very strange texture  kind of slimy  which i did not enjoy  so i returned to eating it dry and was completely content because of the high fiber and healthy content of it  this will become one of those cereals that i by regularly as snack food   but i will stick with life cereal for adding milk to  better dry than with milk,1,0
567,if you receive 100 tea bags after paying this incredibly low price  i paid less than  4 50 and qualified for super saver shipping   then you ve done very well   i received a box of prince of peace 100  organic green tea that contains only 20 tea bags   in scientific studies  people who drink green tea have relatively healthy bones   people who drink cow s milk have relatively unhealthy bones despite the fact that the calcium  the protein  and the vitamin d in cow s milk probably helped their bones   amazon has been so generous with me on other orders that i ve decided not to bother them   i won t contact them to send me 80 more tea bags   the only disadvantage of buying this product is that if you are unlucky and one of the twenty tea bags is leaking  you will need to use your fingers to brush off several specks of green tea leaf fragments resting on the outside of the paper pouch enclosing each tea bag  the pictured product contains 100 tea bags  i received a box containing only 20 tea bags,1,0
1125,yipes  i can t wait to try these in eggs and nutrasystem lunch cups  but they are very powerful on their own  might be exceptional in meat loaf  these are not spicy   they re bell peppers  very powerful taste  not a snack,1,0
1127,as stated above  im a huge alice in wonderland fan  so i decided to give this a try im not really a tea person  but this tea isnt very strong and surprised me with how nice it was i would def  recommend this to anyone who is considering this item the only issue i had with this product was that the tea i like is on the bottom  which makes it difficult because i had to take all the top ones off before i could get to it  that  and the lid for the clear package is not very sturdy   it slides off  huge alice in wonderland fan,1,0
565,know what i like about doublemint gum   it doesn t resemble regular mint flavor at  all    not even a little bit   doublemint actually tastes a thousand times better   but at the same time  doublemint actually makes your breath smell just as great   isn t that wonderful   wrigley s doublement gum is certainly for me   a 15 stick gum pack would keep your minty fresh breath going strong for several weeks  unless you have a gum chewing addiction    then it d be gone in a few days    just don t spend more than 5 bucks   15 dollars is a major ripoff  minty fresh,1,0
1128,i have been purchasing a lot of stuffs from amazon but never left any reviews  this is the one i have to say it is amazing   it stopped  or cured   my husband s pollen allergy  he used to take all kinds of allergy pills trying to stop sneezing  watery eyes and runny nose  but no medicine could attack all the symptoms  for 5 6 years  he had to take many different kinds of medicine    and this year  his symptom got worse  we got the info about how wheatgrass can stop allergy and boost energy  so he started taking 10 tablets a day  before he finished the first bottle  his pollen allergy s gone  his brother and mom who also suffered from pollen allergy for many years  took wheatgrass as well they drank juice   they are pollen allergy free now  i gave half bottle to one of my neighbors and her allergy stopped too  having said that   it doesn t stop my husband s seafood allergy  originally we were just thinking instead of buying medicine  why not spend the money on natural remedies  it wont mess up you body like medicines  and if it doesn t work we will just go back to medicine    but it worked  if you are suffering from pollen allergy  i strongly suggest you try wheatgrass  any brand organic or grow by yourselves but not the ones you buy at juice stand cause they ve been harvest hundred times and had no nutrition at all   it stopped pollen allergy,1,0
1129,i ordered 100 stalks from betterdecor on june 15  2012 and they arrived three days later on june 18 by way of the u s  post office   they are bundled in packs of ten each  wrapped in damp paper towels with the roots in water crystals  all of which were enclosed in a sturdy plastic bag   foam peanuts protect the plants  so  the stalks  or stems  came fast  with healthy green leaves and healthy red roots what you see on the internet is  what you get in your package however  instead of receiving 100 stalks  i actually received 106 stalks  six more than what i expected in addition  instead of being about 4 inches  the stalks measured at about 5 inches tall  so this  too  is much better than i expected if you measure the stalks with the green leaves  they are about 8 to 8 1 2 inches tall the item price   27  and shipping cost   2 50  are well priced  so this is an excellent product at an extremely affordable price   you pay much more if you go to a store    here are brief directions which include information edited from the product description 1  give bright or medium light  avoid direct sunlight or leaves will turn yellow 2  keep the roots below water   tap water is fine   before watering  you may let the tap water sit for a day for the chlorine to evaporate   if the water is heavy on fluoride  you may also use filtered or distilled water   to keep the water clean  change the water once a week or once a month an excellent source of water is fish tank water  from a fresh water tank   i ve been using water from the fish tank and the plants look green and healthy 3  regular indoor room temperature is fine   keep the minimum temperature above 50f one may grow lucky bamboos in just plain water  with rocks or stones to hold them in place or you may plant them in regular potting soil   i actually prefer putting them in soil   for me  it seems they do better in soil   water regularly if you plant them in soil because the plant dries up if you forget to water  a lot of green for your money,1,0
1130,i used to tell of the tales when i worked as a stock boy at a local grocery  and wondered about all the old people in the dog food aisle  looking at the better canned brands   i remarked to one of the other stockers that old people must really love their dogs they are always buying the best stuff  i would never get anything beyond dry for my sisters cat   they basically told me i didn t understand the situation  these people were on social security with no savings and could barely afford utilities   they bought good dogfood cause they got it for themselves well that said  the gal karine  that takes care of my poodle while i work in chicago said that if she got to that bad in retirement  she would condsider eating this dog food  chef michael s grilled sirloin  because my poodle sandy would pick it off the top of the bowl  she mixed it with the other dry food  sandy stays in a large pen during part of the day  his food and water are there   when karine returned to walk sandy  she noticed that the food was spread over one of the pads in the pen  and all the chef michael s stuff was picked out the very top or the most prominant ingredient in this food was beef  and the stuff looks like it  and apparently the dog has judged it to be better than the average fare   smart dog  it looks pretty healthy too from the rest of the ingredients  i will likely buy this one  as a good suppliment to mix with the evo i usually buy  if you were broke  you might eat this stuff yourself ,1,0
564,i was excited to get something to keep the dogs from doo dooing on my lawn  but there just wasn t enough of this stuff to create a solid border   i sprinkled it sparingly around part of the front yard  but that is it   how can it keep the animals away when there is not enough of it as for the container  it states to wear gloves when handling the product so i was nervous about removing the label which was inside the container   i didn t know if i should just cut the label or remove the lid   i ended up cutting the label off there are little openings that made spreading easy   the smell of the product is like cayenne pepper and the consistency is like wet coffee does it work for animals   i don t know because i haven t had it down long enough   if it rains tomorrow  however  i will never know because the product doesn t work after a rain would i buy this product even if it worked   no  because they don t give you enough for it to be a border   i bought a bag of weed and feed for  30 00 that covered the whole back and front yard   this costs  30 00 and it doesn t even border the front yard all the way   30 00 for just my small front yard  this is not an economical product ,1,0
1132,item was a good deal   the caribou blend coffee is a nice blend  not too strong  the price was good for the 24 count box  less than  80 per cup   i will purchase again  caribou,1,0
1133,after trying both the illy and starbucks canned coffees several times i have to say that i much prefer illy   it s not the taste so much as the smell of the canned bottled drink itself   while neither packaged coffee drink smells as pleasant as fresh brewed  i prefer the plainer scent of illy over starbucks which always smells faintly of  gym bag  to me   though i m at a loss of how to explain this that said  the caffe drink is not too bitter or tinny for coffee out of a can  though it s not difficult to get a coffee on the go  these little cans are convenient for around town or packing on picnics or trips   i ve had this straight from the can  over ice  and with a little milk added   it s not too sweet and is a nice pick me up  convenient  preferred over starbucks,1,0
1134,the product does what it says  i did use it one time thinking i could make a healthy dessert option   the apple came out soft as promised it just required a lot of butter and sugar to make it the way i like it   that cancels out the healthy option but i can t blame the product on that  it works,1,0
563,it is hard to tell if any animal deterrent is actually working  but there seem to be no more cat droppings in the areas i used this  it has a peppery smell which is an irritant  this is obviously how it works  in areas that do not get rained on the odor  and presumably the effectiveness seems to last  several weeks now    in areas that get rain  or watered  then smell goes away quickly  but it still seems effective  this may be due to the training of the cats to stay away even after the smell dissipates the shaker container is easy to use and stays closed sealed between applications so far  so good  seems to work  for cats   smells bad  but that s the point ,1,0
1121,aside from the product being as described  and arriving safely and quickly  joel s went of their way to fix my screw up  i mistakenly put the wrong shipping address on my order  when i got the notice alerting me that the shipment would be sent out that day  nice touch when dealing with delicate contents   i just then realized my error  i emailed  explained the situation  and even though they had already labeled my shipment and were headed to the post office  they pulled my order  re labled the box  and shipped the items later that day  now that may not sound like a big deal  but i seriously doubt many sellers would bother to take the time to fix a customer s mistake for a product that probably doesn t have a large profit margin  impressive service ,1,0
562,these are everything they say  i have a malamute that annihilates bones within minutes  rawhide was not even in our consideration  he could rip it off in seconds and choke on sharp pieces  however  the choices out there are slim and i began my research again  after reading the reviews here i decided to risk it   this is really wrapped tight and he s been chewing on it for days  safely i might add  the rawhide is very thick before they even tightly roll it  pass the test ,1,0
1138,i use it to keep dogs from climbing out of the pen  and it works well  completely worth the money  and saved a lot of headache because i didn t have to use 110v  dog pen,1,0
1139,i have two healthy male yellow labs     and they will eat anything  and i do mean anything    so  the issue of dog food is a little less  for lack of a better word   serious  to me   while i have generally steered away from low cost brands of dog food for my two furry disposal systems based on  the uninformed belief that cheap bad  i am not convinced these pricey  ridiculously named superfood brands are anything more than a gimmick   so  i have traditionally chosen the tried and true brand of purina and although purinaone is the staple for our dogs  beneful proved to be a nice change of pace for them   another plus is the  zip loc  type bag the food comes in the biggest issue that some may have with beneful is that its main protein source is  chicken by product    2 on the ingredient list  while the more substantial protein source of beef is  7 on the ingredient list   animal by products used in animal feed open the possibility of dead or diseased animals being incorporated into the mix  as well as animal parts not fit for human consumption   the aafco  association of american feed control officials  is the monitoring entity for such issues and while they have green lighted beneful  there is no sure fire way to determine what comprises chicken by product in each and every bag of food     this may be a deal breaker to some   on the other hand  most dog owners have probably seen worse things being digested by their beloved pets on a fairly regular basis another point that might be a problem for some is the use of grain fillers as the primary ingredients   1  3 and 4 on the ingredients list  in beneful     a likely sticking point for those who prefer  natural  or  organic  diets for their dogs   again  this is a personal preference issue for the pet owner both my dogs love beneful  which is important to me   for 40 years  purina products have been a main source of food for my pets   i have never encountered any issues with their products and believe the rational point of view is that pet food standards have only improved over the years   i am also a little skeptical of the detrimental claims that generally guide people to purchase more expensive products that emphasize buzzwords like  natural  and  organic      as the terms can be very loosely defined and too new to earn government interference regarding their veracity   there have been too many instances where false or unfounded claims have scared people away from a myriad of consumer products     so i tend to take grain and by product issues less seriously   obviously  dog food choice is a personal issue between owner and pet and i have no problem incorporating beneful as a change of pace from the purinaone on occasion  most importantly  the dogs love it    ,1,0
1140,so i looked everywhere for reviews of the cocoa flavored powder   it s still just hitting the shelves  so not many have ventured to try it yet   i m guessing because so many were disappointed by the taste of the original   i never tried the original powder  because the reviews were too detrimental   i knew i would hate it and didn t want to invest   while this is not glass of chocolate milk  the dark chocolate flavor is what hits the taste buds first   there is still the grass flavor   but i don t mind that taste   it s lightly sweetened  but has only 11g of sugar per serving which is less than half of what s in the original powder   34g of protein and loaded with vitamins and minerals   i felt full after drinking 1 2 serving   i only give  4 stars because it gets super duper thick within minutes which makes it hard to get down   i bought the powder to be my meal on the go that i can carry all day and sip to keep my blood sugar and hunger under control   hard to do when it becomes a custard like consistency   i read that adding more liquid does the trick   but i mixed mine with almond coconut milk and didn t have it on hand   i will try to use water tomorrow   try the product   it is worth it  completely bearable   and after a few days  might even be enjoyable   like a healthy chocolate treat  exceeded all expectations,1,0
1141,the oil worked very well  however  the supposed butter flavor was not noticeable as we still added melted butter   i switched to using regular coconut oil and the melted butter and it is fine   i also didn t care for the fact that there wasn t a way to reseal the pack except to fold it over and put a paper clip on it  but then you better use it soon   we very rarely made a full pot of popcorn   i find using the jar of coconut oil more flexible  didn t notice anything with the butter flavor,1,0
1142,the alaskan pink salmon cannot be more than 3 years old while the alaskan sockeye salmon can be up to 8 years old   more alaskan pink salmon is harvested each year  by weight  than all other alaskan salmon species put together   thus  pink salmon is the smallest  youngest  and most plentiful of the alaskan salmon   this means that you will probably save a huge amount of money and also get slightly more delicious salmon skin inside of each can than you would from canned alaskan sockeye salmon   true  one can of alaskan sockeye salmon has more fat than one can of alaskan pink salmon   the meat of the alaskan sockeye is higher in fat and higher in the beneficial carotenoid  astaxanthin  which gives salmon  trout  crabs  lobsters  shrimp  krill  flamingos  and some bacteria their red or pink color   yes  the canned sockeye is slightly better than the canned pink but the price is almost twice as high   interestingly  masahide kaeriyama compared the stomach contents of the alaskan pink salmon against the stomach contents of the alaskan sockeye salmon and discovered that    1 both species of salmon are eating almost the exact same things when in the ocean   2 squid is the favorite food of both species of salmon  comprising about one fourth to one third of their total diet   3 red krill  a euphausiid  comprises less than 10  of the total diet of both species of salmon   4 fishes comprise only about 5  of the total diet of both species of salmon  and  5 copepods  amphipods  decapods  pteropods  octopods  euphausiids  polychaetes  chaetognaths  ostracods  halocypridids  cumacea  gelatinous zooplankton  and barnacles were also found in the stomachs of both the alaskan pink salmon and the alaskan sockeye salmon   because of different dna  however  1 pound of alaskan sockeye salmon meat has 18 33mg of astaxanthin but 1 pound of alaskan pink salmon meat has only 2 45mg of astaxanthin   average amounts of astaxanthin contained in 1 pound of other salmon species   2 55mg for alaskan chum  keta  silverbrite  salmon  6 26mg for alaskan coho  silver  salmon  4 04mg for alaskan king  chinook  salmon  and 2 40mg for wild atlantic salmon   finally  wild salmon is considered even healthier for us to eat than farmed salmon  partly because wild salmon has better omega 3 to omega 6 fatty acid ratios than farmed salmon   the average omega 3 to omega 6 ratios are as follows   farmed atlantic salmon 2 55 to 1  wild atlantic salmon 11 72 to 1  canned wild alaskan sockeye salmon 10 94 to 1  canned wild alaskan pink salmon 12 74 to 1  wild alaskan chum salmon 12 31 to 1  wild alaskan coho salmon 7 15 to 1  and smoked alaskan king salmon  lox  1 11 to 1  if you can t afford canned alaskan sockeye salmon  then canned alaskan pink salmon has advantages,1,0
560,so the beans arrived three days after i ordered them  it was the first out of three products ordered  the beans are small  smaller than i had hoped  it says one pound  right  to be blunt  to me it s kinda like half a pound  the reason i gave it four stars was because of the price  and because the shipping was pretty fast  it s a 16 oz package of tiny beans  nothing more  nothing less  ok    i guess,1,0
1144,okay  i jumped the gun  because they were sending me the review information  before i received my chips  so i thought i would be honest  and indicate that i have not received them  and i wasn t happy about not receiving them  however overall  the service is not bad  and my chips are on the way sorry guys  they really are not bad people  i am just an impatient buyer    there  is that better  re rating,1,0
1145,my title says it all  i am not a snacker but can t leave these alone  most potato chips are too greasy  too salty  too   too   you get the idea  there are many advertisements for 100 calorie snacks  some which are barely food  but many of these popchips are 100 calories on the food network was a recipe for potatochos  nachos from potato chips  these paks would easily do this or dessert nachos with potato chips and chocolate i purchased the snack packs because all the flavors are included  many i ve never tried  and the smaller size limits the munchies from a run away snack attacks   i hope  so far i have no preference for flavor   what about you  my new fav snack  or addition  ,1,0
1146,the product mixed well when i used room temperature water and a container to shake it up in  the product taste s better when the water is doubled and the instructions ignored  the product will also lose the slight goat and formula smell when the water is doubled  that goes for all the products they sell  even the carton milk  the milk tastes really good as long as it is made like that  meyenberg non fat canned powder goat milk,1,0
559,this stuff tastes okay to me  but with a hint of aftertaste   however  i obtained it for my daughter who needs some vitamin help right now due to a medical thing   she likes the flavor  but the problem is i did not note that it has caffeine in it   so i won t get more of it as she really does not need caffeine at all   but other than that  i don t see a problem  okay  but   ,1,0
1149,i have received and used this product several times in the past few months and love the taste  this order arrived with part of the product melted and re solidified  i was at home when the product arrived  it was on my porch no longer than a minute or so  it was not melted when i opened it shortly after i retrieved it  but had melted and re solidified sometime before arrival  many of the pieces had melted and were stuck together  the product looks ok  except for the melted pieces  but the taste of the melted pieces is somewhat suspect  amazon was kind enough to credit my account for the purchase  some melted product,1,0
1150,mickey  my toy poodle  who is overweight by the way  has been eating beneful  healthy weight  not sure why  since he is as i stated overweight  i was trying to save this bag for when i ran out of the big bag i already have  i noticed that mickey eats all of the soft pieces from his bowl  and leaves the others there until he is starving so i thought why not try it out well he was excited by the bag itself  and it does look good enough for human consumption if you just look at the bag  so he probably thought it was real food  i don t think he caught the  chef michael  but maybe he did since he sometimes acts as if he can read  anyway  he was jumping up and down and ready to eat i only give him half a cup  but he munched it right up  afterwards  i caught him going in the bag  which he never does  so i had to lock it up  this am  he was so ready to eat that he came straight in from his morning business  i didn t have to call him or hunt him down i don t know if it s actually good for him  i don t read labels  sorry but from some of the other reviews  it ain t good for him  if mickey were writing the review i think he would give it 10 stars  maybe his old food is boring  if you are concerned about the ingredients  you may want to pick another kind  mickey is 8yrs old  so i treat him like a senior citizen and let him eat almost whatever he wants     it s canine crack,1,0
1151,these are okay  i ve been getting brunswick as long as i can remember and thought i d try these because they cost a bit less  these are much  much milder  they are not as smokey or fishy  i think i like the consistency of these better  they aren t as flaky and each filet comes from a single fish  if the price difference between this fish and king oscar and brunswick remain as high  i ll probably get them again  ok,1,0
557,i love having the huge selection without having to buy an entire box of one kind   this gave me the chance to try some things that i would not have   sometimes i want to try that new flavor  but i just don t want to spend the money on the whole box   it did come with a few mint flavors which i had to toss   mint is a severe migraine trigger  but the rest of the cups are all very good  just my cup of tea,1,0
561,tastes like fruit punch     the same as most other fruit punches i ve had in my lifetime  a little bit of artificial aftertaste  though   you can tailor the taste to your preferences     although one squeeze per 8 ounces of water is recommended the big deal is the added vitamin c  with some good amounts of vitamin b also added   i guess good for kids who survive on junk food not fruits and vegetables within reason  diarrhea  you can t get too much vitamin c  also at  6 00 a small bottle is a bit expensive  however this has the usually added stuff like caffeine  taurine  the aforementioned vitamins and also electrolytes     so in that regard this potion is the equivalent of many super expensive energy drinks  it s up to you to decide what is necessary  if you are trying to have a replacement crystal light red bull gatorade combo     go for it   see how it works for you keep in mind the bottle has a total of 960 mg of caffeine about 8 cups of normal brewed at home coffee  cue the cute cheerleaders   ,1,0
569,my dog is not the most persnickety dog i ve ever met  she eats raccoon poop sometimes  but then again she won t eat just anything  won t touch half the veggie food that i serve at the table   but this food  she loves   she usually eats most dog foods just until she s full and then leaves the rest for later   but this food she eats like a kid eats candy   i think she would eat the whole bag if i let her the food pieces are moist and tender  not as moist as canned food  but not crunchy like other dry dog food   there are little pieces that look like meat  but when you look closely you can tell it s some sort of conglomerate food  sort of like a chicken nugget idea   there s obviously food coloring in here   the pieces are different pretty colors   how do dogs do with red 40   she seems fine after eating one dose anyway okay  personal problem here    is it ethical to be eating a vegan diet myself and be serving sirloin beef to my dog   i can justify serving the dog the leftover meat stuff that probably wouldn t be used for anything else and would probably be thrown away otherwise   but to kill one mammal to feed another   even if she is my best buddy  that bothers me   she likes it   so  whatever  i ll think this over and see if i keep buying it  gourmet dog food for sure ,1,0
1119,i ordered this on june 14  2012 and it arrived four days later on june 18   it came in a four inch plastic container  packaged with foam peanuts my plant is more leafy or lush than the one pictured on the internet   my plant has about 34 leaves of varying sizes   it is bushy or very full for its container so i was able to divide this plant this is the first time i have seen a plant with this unusual coloring so i am pleased to have this new color which is kind of yellow and green   the new leaves are yellow green with yellow being the primary color  while the older leaves appear to be light green yellow  with a light green being the primary color this fine and healthy plant is a new one to add to your collection  neon color plant,1,0
1118,i had never even heard of canned potato salad much less tasted it  however  i m out here in the arizona desert and things spoil even in refrigerators  i browsed through the grocery   gourmet section  found read german potato salad and decided to give it a try  the taste is there but it lacks the mayonnaise texture  other than that it s great  almost but not quite,1,0
1087,these are delicious and make a wonderful snack  especially with fruit   bought two bags at walmart recently for around  7 each  but our local store does not stock them   why this inflated price   apparently  they are shipped in cartons of three or six  but this is certainly not made clear here   i decided to buy from drugstore com  where the unit price is given explicitly  price must be for a carton,1,0
1088,this is a tough product to review   i put it around the flowers in the pots at my pool   i was having squirrels literally toss the flowers out  i assume looking for nuts from last year  not being terribly squirrly myself i can t claim to know why the squirrels were yanking my flowers out but that is my guess   i put this stuff around the flowers and have not had any issues since   i am making a leap of faith that the granules are the reason why the squirrels have not returned   they are still in the yard but have not bothered the plants  since i am not sure that the product drove the squirrels away i can t give it 5 stars but since i am pretty sure  i will give it four stars   btw it does not have the strong odor i have found on similar types of products i have used in the past  it appears to work,1,0
1089,i have been taking cinnamon medicinally for many months now  however  in some of my research i found that the cinnamon i buy in the grocery store was not the kind that helps lower stabilize blood sugar  i read that it was the ceylon cinnamon that did this  so i ordered it  it is actually more mild than the grocery story kind  a little grittier  and it has a sweet taste  i use a spoon of this along with the same amount of turmeric  that i ordered from the same company   milk thistle  a liquid multi vitamin  and water every morning  i feel this improves my health  i was a little concerned that there was no inner or outer safety seal on this product  the turmeric had and inside safety seal  i called the company and they said there was a freshness seal  but that is not the same as a safety seal  ceylon cinnamon powder,1,0
1090,it s kind of a running joke in my neighborhood about how many cats i have   i have none but my yard is fully of them  using my mulch as cat litter   my yard is big with lots of trees and bushes and lots of mulch   now you can t even walk to the back of my yard because of the fleas and cat poop   i ve tried many things over the years   this time  after my grass was cut  i sprinkled this stuff on the many spots that i ve seen the cats go to the bathroom and they no longer go there   i also have alot of squirrels and a possum or two from time to time and haven t seen them either   this stuff is safe for your grass and plants   i m hoping it works until it rains then i would have to sprinkle again   i m not sure why the cats dont  like it but i ve seen them walk to their normal spots and then just walk away   it must have something unpleasant in it   i will have to get gallons of this stuff but if it works  it s well worth it if you have pest problems  try this  really works,1,0
1091,i like this cereal over all the other ones out there  so i gave it 5 stars   you pick up the box and can just tell it has more substance to it   a lot of cereals show plenty of fruit and nuts on the picture on the outside of the box  but then the actual cereal has very litte   this quaker cereal is different and i hope they don t cheapen it over time like the others are doing but  21 for a 56 ounce box      are they out of their mind      one 28 oz box cost  4 50 in the grocery store  so 56 oz would cost  9   where do they get off charging  12 more is a mystery to me   unless i m reading this incorrectly  and they are selling several 56 oz boxes for  21 update 9 1 2012  i see they have reduced the price from  21 to  11 24   but it s still not  9 like it would be at the store  and what would shipping add to it  omg      21     are you serious       updated,1,0
1092,i have seven grand kids  2 of them fell off a play ground equipment at the same time  one is in a leg cast  the other one hurt her back  they are 3   7  they loved it and it gave them alot to do  they put everything on the floor and sent me a picture  there certainly were overwhelmed  the girls loved it,1,0
1093,i have had this for 2 weeks now and have tried various methods of consumption  the tea tastes terrible very bitter  although if you plan to make tea use lots of cinnamon to mask and maybe some honey as well  the best method  for my self  is gelatin capsules  you wont have to deal with any bitterness and this is the only thing that gave me any results  i believe it effects everyone differently  as for my self about 4 5 caps to notice any effect  more caps   greater effect   i had rather long detailed dreams that seemed to be much more real as compared to non calea dreams  i remember waking up after my first experience with the capsules and having to think really hard to determine weather or not i had just been dreaming or if what had just happened was real  the amount of dreams i experienced in one night with at least 5 caps was double if not triple what i normally have  although no lucid dreams yet and i m not sure if it helps my ability to lucid dream since it makes my dreams seem even more real  but this did not work right away  and i would not expect any thing super crazy to happen  start off small to gauge your own personal reaction to it and go from there  the effects of this are very subtle  but it will change your dreams i m sure of it  worth a shot,1,0
1094,this popcorn was fine   but i recently purchased some jollytime brand white popcorn at a local grocery store   of course way less expensive than the price of this product   jollytime was  1 50 for 2 lb bag and i d say the quality and tenderness was about as good   so even though this is a fine product  don t think i d pay this premium when i can get something pretty similar at the local grocery store  ok,1,0
1095,would love to try this after the rave reviews   did i miss something or does the description not list the colors included or the amount of each color  gave the product 5 stars    can t be critical of something i haven t tried but amazon s description gets a minus  need more info,1,0
1096,this is the least strong and bitter coffee i can find in k cups  i do not like strong coffee and this is the only one i can enjoy out of all that came in the variety pack that came with the coffee maker  a little bitter but ok,1,0
1097,my husband recently bought this for me when i sent him to get cooking spray  originally i thought it was a waste of money  but now i am a believer  i used it to spray down a cake pan  and once it cooled and i flipped it to take it out of the pan it came right out  i didn t have to do anything  it was perfect  i baked muffins for breakfast today  and even still hot  they fell right out of the tin  i don t normally review kitchen items  but this one is so wonderful i just had to  i will now have it on my list of kitchen must haves  new must have ,1,0
1098,disappointed with previous orders of macarons from other us places  i didn t expect these to be much better  i fell in love with macarons when i was in france but had found nowhere to buy locally and ordered products ranged from rock hard stale to crumbled messes  these arrived safely packaged  fresh and wonderful flavor  i highly recommend this company to anyone seeing quality items  macarons with great flavor and freshness ,1,0
1099,for father s day i presented dear old dad with all moustache themed gifts  these candies made the cut   the candy itself is quite off putting   as while itty bitty  staches are adorable  the fact that they re a smokey black gray color makes the brain think of licorice or  well  anything that isn t fruity  but they re indeed generically fruit flavored  not too tasty and pretty darn hard  not sure we recieved the freshest batch  but i think had they been more gummy or even passably soft they d have scored higher on the taste scale but the fact is you buy this sort of novelty as a stocking stuffer type of gift  or  in my case  just to go with a theme  the tin is well made and dad will probably use it to store some tiny  albeit manly man odds   ends  is it overpriced for what you actually get  you betcha  but since they don t sell moustache candy at every corner store  the price is worth the smile just skip actually eating the candy    unless chipping a tooth is kind of your thing or if you re on the  dark grey food only  diet  and of course  understand it s a small piece and won t feed  if you re brave  the entire neighborhood  small  stache for lots of cash 4 stars for the novelty tin  1 star for the contents  if you re dead set on mustache candy and have teeth as mighty as chuck norris  order away  you re paying for the tin,1,0
1101,this tea is great  but alas  it has a big flaw for me  there is a lack of strong mint flavoring in this mix  i definitely expected a strong mint taste mixing well with the green tea  but there s a lack of mint taste here  you can see the leaves in there  but the taste is lacking other than that  it s a great green tea  i suggest steeping it for longer than the directions say  but definitely not longer than 3 minutes  maybe even adding a bit of spearmint herbal tea will help  love this tea  but it needs more mint ,1,0
1102,this coffee is ok  i have given my nescafe machine away since i bought this coffee  it s just too much trouble to order coffee by mail when i can get the  other  brand at the grocery store  just ok,1,0
1103,i would do this all the time  except the price shot up to over  23 after my first purchase  this home drinks this instead of sodas  easy way to buy by the case,1,0
1104,i didn t buy from the seller but these are very good cookies   i agree with the other reviews that these don t really taste like cheesecake but rather vanilla frosting   still they go good with a glass of milk   can buy for  2 a box at most stores so this is very overpriced great cookies,1,0
570,this is a very mild coffee drink  made with milk and sugar   it definitely has the taste of espresso  but it is not overpowering   i typically take my coffee with milk  so this flavor appealed to me   however  if you like your coffee strong and black  you will probably think this tastes awful i was a little concerned about the added sugar  as i don t put any in my coffee and i dislike sugary drinks   this beverage was not overly sweet one thing i will suggest is you make sure the drink is icy cold before you try it   i tried it when it was barely chilled  and thought it was so so  but after sampling it very cold  it was delicious  loved it ,1,0
1116,i really liked the taste  but gave it 4 stars because just about all the cans had big dents in them   nothing leaked  just wasn t pleased with way it was shipped  otherwise  i really liked it  no sugar or preservatives added  tasty coconut water,1,0
1115,the old recipe was really sticky and the chocolate melted  it also tasted only ok  with this new packaging  it seems like they have also updated the recipe  it is now more solid  easier to eat  and less  grassy   i was going to cancel my subscription  but not anymore  new packaging   new recipe   great ,1,0
571,i too fondly remember and miss the keebler version from years past as does my dad  so i bought these as a father s day gift in hopes they d measure up  well they don t quite make it  not that they re bad  they are more  graham crackery  in consistency with that sort of crunch as opposed to the cookie taste the old ones had  they re also thinner with half as much raisin filling  so the search goes on  sorry dad  these will have to do for now    keebler  are you listening signed a big fanp s  the case of 12 is a better deal  but unfortunate that you ll have more than you need  when they don t taste the same   close   but not quite ,1,0
572,the taste the taste the taste is gonna move ya   i remember that catchy little jingle back in the 80 s when i was young and watching morning cartoons and alf   it s a perfect melody for a wonderful and sunny girl chasing day on the surfboard   back then we didn t realize how silly such a song is   nowadays such innocent stupidity has been replaced by    a man in a dance competition and attempting to win a klondike bar  and winning with the confetti raining down    yikes is that ever awful  wrigley s juicy fruit gum is addicting   if it wasn t for the poor state of my teeth and my dentists highly recommended wishes to avoid sugary foods  i d be chewing this stuff all the time   actually it hurts when i chew gum for several minutes at a time these days    so i probably wouldn t   i guess the jingle is right  the taste is gonna move me all the way to the dentists office and a monthly 100 dollar bill anyway  this is probably my favorite gum flavor wise   my teeth may not like it  my dentist may not like it  but the sugar gods above shine down with a smile whenever i chew it so at least i could appease somebody  juiciest of fruits,1,0
1114,i get these for less than a dollar at walmart   i compared them with king oscar and others from two to three times the cost   i honestly don t feel that the extra money paid for those is particularly worth it one minor correction from the description shown above is that it is stated on the can that these have  natural smoke flavoring  and not artificial   others including myself like the small bones soybean oil is not supposed to be as good for you as olive oil  but that doesn t bother me  best value in sardines ,1,0
556,tea tastes wonderful  no weird  fishy  smell  or  muddy  taste like some have said about other suppliers  individually wrapped 100 tea bags shipping  product came fast and in great condition  i ll order again   ,1,0
1113,no local place makes macarons  sadly they think a macaron is the same thing as a macaroon  i had ordered from other places  always a disappointment these macarons have incredible flavor  fresh and  warning   addictive  with a wide variety of the best of flavors  i recommend this company for your macarons cravings or for special gifts to people you want to give a real treat  a taste of france,1,0
575,i thought these had avery good flavor   i took two tubs to work and most of the people liked them   two or three people commented that they liked them better than some other brands because they are not salty  good flavor and not too salty,1,0
1110,you need to chew 3 pieces of this gum for the flavor to last two to three minutes   one piece is way too small and the flavor is gone very fast   i purchased this to avoid things that are not good for you and that is why it got four stars   if you want a healthy gum this is the best i have found so far  the glee tangerine better  but get both for variety pros  not harmful and has good flavor while it lasts cons  the flavor does not last more than three minutes with three pieces and it is sticky compared with regular gum  3 pieces,1,0
1109,this bar taste great  it came in a cardboard box  and despite it being 90 degrees outside it was not melted  shocking  i know  i had completely thought that would be a problem  but not at all  wasnt even broken  very satisfied with my entire order  yummo,1,0
1108,product is as advertised   a full body strong coffee   the difference between this and other k cup coffee is it leaves a sediment in the cup   this is not detrimental to the taste  french roast,1,0
1107,each teabag is individually wrapped  when you open it  you ll definitely notice the spices   mostly i notice cardamom  but also some cinnamon  not as much as i would like    i love cinnamon   and perhaps cloves   not sure what else   the tea itself was smooth  not overbearing without milk  it brewed up to be a pleasant  mildly spiced cup of black tea   not bad   with milk  the spices were just gone   perhaps i needed to make a more concentrated brew  but even so   it s probably not realistic to think that you re going to get the real chai experience from a teabag  but if you like chai spices you might like this tea for that  nice tea  but not like chai i ve had,1,0
1106,for diabetics  it s hard to get reasonably priced sweets for diabetics in chocolate  hope they can continue to find a way  too bad customers give sugar free splenda chocolate such a bad rep  so the grocery stores won t stock them at a reasonable price  tnx to russell stover for making chocolate candy economical,1,0
573,i won them off a penny auction site  my 2 year old likes them plenty  i don t think there is any potato flavor  they taste more like ricecakes to me  but are ok  the salt and vinegar is strong holy cow   not bad,1,0
578,miso soup is one of those aquired tastes i m trying to aquire   though more usually ends up in the toilet than in my stomach  this stuff wasn t too bad   i finished the whole bowl   maybe i added too much water because there wasn t any extreme salty taste   it would be a good soup for the miso phobe to try  marukome green onion,1,0
555,this sauce has a nice flavor outside of the heat  kind of a vinegary fruity taste  the problem with this sauce is that in the mouth  it isn t even as hot as the naga jolokia  or even scoth bonnet hot sauce i ve had  but it did wreak havoc on my stomach and bowels  which was sort of to be expected  but i ve had other sauces that were much hotter on the mouth that didn t wreck me in the bathroom  be warned  tastes good  but the heat is surprisingly low ,1,0
1154,while this is a wonderful tasting pasta the order i recieved contained clearly labeled linguine  definitely not tagliatelle  we will use up this pasta as the taste is nice but i am back on the hunt for genuine tagliatelle  i guess i need to cancel the subscribe and save order for this pasta  not tagliatelle ,1,0
543,i bought this tea to go with a tea tumbler as a gift  so i cannot attest to the taste  although the recipient said she liked it  but it did not smell robust  aromatic or bold  it smelled stale and mediocre  the tins are beautiful  but next time  i think i will spend a little extra money to get one flavor that smells robust and lively  decent tea for the price,1,0

1188,i have been on a gluten free diet for the past couple of years  during that time i have tried the good  the bad and the truly awful  i don t know how much money has been thrown out over the years  due to the horrible flavors and textures  thank goodness for the gluten free mama line of flour and mixes  everything i have tried has been wonderful and hard to distinguish from the wheat based product  they don t have the grittiness of most of the gluten free products on the market  i use the flour blend to make bread  when i am motivated        to use as breading for fried foods and for all the recipes i had used rice flour for  i highly recommend this entire line of products   you won t be sorry  gluten free mama   delicious ,1,0
542,my daughter is 4 months old and has reflux and this is the only formula she can hold down and we ve tried almost all of them   we ve even tried adding rice cereal  i know you re not supposed to  but let s be honest   we all do  to other brands  but nope  spit that up too  this formula actually helped her almost immediately   within the first day of using it  her spitting up drastically reduced   it does constipate her  like other reviewers have said  but our ped said we could give her 4oz of apple juice every day to help with it   we do that  and it helps a little  but we ve found that the baby probiotic  baby giaia  works waaaaay better don t get it on amazon  got to your local pharmacy and get it there   it s expensive  like  30   but with the formula and the probiotic  my daughter is now an angel  love ,1,0
541,this birthday package was huge  and the packaging was lovely  once i unwrapped it  there wasn t  quite  as much inside as the multiple boxes suggested there might be  but what was in there was high quality  several trail mixes  jelly beans  cookies  a stuffed bear  cheese  crackers  nuts  pretzels  candies  the individual packages were small  but not tiny   but there were a few of them  i would say there would most certainly be something for everyone in the package  and the snacks were quality   i m a relatively picky snacker and there was nothing in there i wouldn t eat  nice variety  lots of packaging,1,0
540,so splenda may not be the healthiest product but i use it so  the fact that fiber was added to this sweetner is wonderful  i dont cook with it but i use it in my coffee about twice a day so this way i get a good amount of fiber  it doesnt taste like sugar but it also doesnt have a horrible after taste like other sugar free sweetners  wonderful,1,0
1191,this is the lightest roast i ve ever seen  and the thinnest consistency  high fraction of oil  as well   maybe that s what you want  maybe it isn t   it s fine for hummus but too thin to be used a standalone dip  very light roast  very thin consistency,1,0

1194,i was so happy to receive my organic extra virgin coconut oil  it arrived when it was estimated to arrive  it was packaged properly  my only concern at first was that the oil was in liquid format  but after reading the the information on the back of the jar  it did state that it will become solid at room temperature  so i will wait to see if it gets solid  i have ordered coconut oil in the past  but it did not smell like coconut  this product actually smells like coconut  i love the smell  i have opened the jar at least 5 times while writing this to take in the aroma  so excited to try my new coconut oil on my newly natural hair  nature s way efagold organic extra virgin coconut oil,1,0
1195,my two little yorkies are finicky pups   they ll eat something when it s new  but a week later turn their noses up at it   it s been a month now and they re still eating it when i first opened the package  they didn t exactly jump for joy   in fact  they backed away from it   i held one of the pieces out to them and they seemed very disinterested   i was thinking for a minute there they weren t going to eat it at all   and  this is a very big bag of dog food for two little dogs   however  when i put it in their dish they started eating right away   because the pieces are rather large for small dogs  they can only eat one piece at a time   the food seems to be a bit chewy  so it takes a while to eat one piece   there s no real oder that i can smell  but because it doesn t smell like pupa roni they aren t fighting over it  a month later and they re still eating it,1,0
539,i did not get this from amazon i got it from petkare 2 i was feeding my hedgehogs  yes hedgehogs eat cat food  chicken soup cat food and kitten food for the babies i have  the reason i switched is because diamoned pet recalled their food due to salmonella which would explain the green poop my hedgehogs were having for the past 3 days all though natural balance does not have some of the ingredents  chicken soup has natural balance is still a good brand of cat food and since its for kittens and adult cats it saves me money instead of paying 11 00  on both cat and kitten food on chicken soup im spending 15 00 on one bag of food same weight as chicken soup saving 7  which i could spend on other things i need for my pets like bedding or other pet food for my other pets wonderful,1,0
1197,i m a huge fan of cinnamon  so these oatmeal squares seemed like a good idea   overall  they re not bad   yes  there is a cinnamon flavor  albeit  somewhat weak   if you ve had the regular quaker squares and liked them  you ll like these   overall  they tasted okay  but not very memorable   good enough to where i ll finish the box  not bad,1,0
1184,wow  did we get enlightened by doing some research about olive oil  unless it is labeled or described completely  you don t know what you re getting  for example  olive oil  from italy  doesn t necessarily mean the olives were grown there  anyway  my wife says this is the real thing  wife says it s the real thing ,1,0

1200,it seems  having a look at other voices  reviews  that i m not alone in discovering that quaker oatmeal squares make an excellent snack all on their own  and in fact  with the exception of one bowl with milk  this is how i consumed my box within a very few days   however  that s not to say that they re not good with milk i m a big fan of oats  in fact  i cook oats in broth and have them as a side dish  so i was happy to have the opportunity to sample this for review  first  those who aren t all that familiar with oats should be aware that they not only contain a fair amount of  roughage   but that they re also high in soluble fiber as well  this is why they re considered heart healthful  that s literate speak for  heart healthy    it s this fiber that s responsible for oats   slippery  quality when they meet liquids and why colloidal oatmeal is so effective as a natural soothing agent for inflamed skin and  when cooked  rolled oats tend to be gummy  i personally don t find this off putting and found it to be minimal in this case  but i digress quaker oatmeal squares are quite lovely  they re not too sweet and i found they held their crunch quite well when combined with milk  but then i tend not to linger over a bowl of dry cereal for that very reason  if i want mush  i ll cook my grains   however  i don t keep a lot of milk in the house  especially over the summer  it just doesn t taste good then   so i found myself snacking when i was in need of a nosh  my day just isn t complete without something sweet   and y know  they really hit the spot  i felt that at least i wasn t eating total junk and was ingesting some fiber as well my only complaint is the addition of white sugar and artificial colors  i m aware that brown sugar is only marginally more healthful than white sugar but even so  why include white sugar in a brown sugar flavored product  if you think it needs to be sweeter  just up the brown sugar  or use dehydrated cane juice or sucanat   and why add colors  if you re targeting health conscious customers  do so all the way  it can be used as a marketing tool   free from artificial colors  flavors         it never fails to astonish me just how dim corporate america is  and it s especially painful where food is concerned  the irony here is that quaker oats really are a healthful product   get with it  guys all in all  if you re not a health purist and want an at least somewhat healthful cold cereal  you could do a lot worse than quaker oatmeal squares  especially given their  snackability   i ve reviewed several cereals for vine  this one is undoubtedly my favorite  does double duty,1,0
1201,i was really surprised when i received spices from this seller  i could not believe there was so much spice for such a low price  i would recommend getting your spices from this seller this jar of spice and the other spices this seller has on amazon com  is approximately 4  tall and 3  wide from the side of the jar  try it for yourself  you will understand why i gave such a good review  great tasting spices and very low prices in a big jar,1,0
1202,i just started buying this product again  it is now made in canada   at one time i quit buying from this company because the product used to made in china  chinese food products made for export have practically zero quality control and many are contaminated with toxic chemicals  great product ,1,0

1204,these are 4 oz cans of coffee not 8 oz as in the caffeinated  sugared coffees   you get half the amount of coffee for an inflated price so you basically get to pay twice as much for half as much coffee   gyp love the coffee but the price is inflated    ,1,0

536,i use less than half a teaspoon per 10 oz of water  because this stuff is that strong  buyer beware if you aren t careful  it needs refrigeration according to several food safety websites  so don t leave it in the cabinet after opening update  still haven t run out  tastes fine  too  just keep it in an airtight container in the coldest part of your fridge  you will never run out ,1,0
535,i wasn t expecting much from a cappuccino in a can but this is quite good  smells like coffee  no bitterness  tastes like coffee but not very strong coffee  i would guess medium roast  not too sweet but definitely  treat  sweetness    18 grams sugar  light cocoa flavor  a nice amount of milk  not too much  good chilled  would be good over ice  no weird aftertaste  has 81 mg caffeine  only 100 calories  tastes like more this isn t like a cappuccino at your favorite coffee shop but this is a good  convenient treat  i wouldn t drink it every day ingredients   coffee  low fat milk  sugar  cocoa powder  potassium bicarbonate  cellulose gel  potassium citrate  cellulose gum  carrageenan tastes like more than 100 calories,1,0
1209,considering what cat litter products are available to me  this is the best choice  i only have one requirement for cat litter  no odor  feline pine delivers  as far as i m concerned  if you can walk into my new york city sized studio and not smell a single one of my five cats  then this product is doing it s job and doing it 100  unlike clay litters this does not leave annoying clay rocks all over my apartment  it leaves absolutely no trace of urine odor  and that disgusting wet urine saturated clay litter smell  gone forever  when i come home from work  i smell nothing i don t know if my town even has a feed store to get the cheaper version of feline pine  i don t care  i ll gladly pay the extra money  in fact  i purchased two 20 pound bags today and it costs me about  20 00  it s worth it a word to the unsatisfied  try using a sifting litter box for feline pine or rubber gloves to clean the poop out by hand  then you won t waste so much unused litter when emptying the feces and urine daily  5 cats 0 odor,1,0
1210,this coffee isn t as flavorfull as the kona coffee i got from hawaii  seems like it is a mix of other coffees to keep the price down  it is good just not as good as i was expecting  i might buy again but there are other coffees that have more flavor  kona coffee,1,0
1211,we have bought earth s best organic baby food in a department store previously  after discovering our baby liked it  we went to amazon to compare prices and larger quantities the baby food is great  no complaints at all  the packaging was sub par  the first thing we noticed was the exterior box wasnt taped or sealed   it was a clamshell type box that folds over and you insert part of the box back into itself   anyone could have opened the package and closed it again   the jars are shrink wrapped with a cardboard base  the exterior packaging appears undamaged inside there were broken jars of food   and grocery items are not returnable  we have contacted amazon s customer service and am waiting a response  great product   poor packaging,1,0

1212,if you were a child of the 80 s you will feel a definite sense of deja vu with this product  the smell and feel of it reminded me instantly of permasoft  the next closest smell would be pert plus  it s the same manufacturer as pert plus so that makes sense this shampoo did a great job of removing hairstyling product buildup without stripping my hair  and i didn t have to shampoo twice to achieve that  i tested it on 3 day old gross hair  and one wash removed all the buildup and gunk  i used it without a follow up conditioner and my hair was not frizzy  dry  or flyaway like it normally would be with what i consider a  drugstore product   it was very soft and had soft waves  no frizz i normally only use a few certain salon brands on my hair because i have it colored and i use a flatiron a lot  lots of damage potential there    i would consider this brand of shampoo to be an acceptable substitute and not worry too much that it s stripping my color in the meantime i would buy this  wonderful scent  buffered lather  didn t strip my hair,1,0
1199,i spread this around my lettuce boxes  which have been exhibiting little nibbles despite us living in an urban area  i see the bunny hopping around from time to time    i made sure to apply on a dry night  when i knew there wouldn t be any rain for a day or two   there were no new nibbles  but the smell was significantly diminished after a night or two   it s worth noting that most of what i d want to protect  herbs  veggies  needs a lot of water  making this  lasts 30 days  claim a bit dubious   that being said  i think a mouthful must have deterred peter cottontail  who hasn t been back for seconds   so  maybe even if i can t smell it  it s working  or maybe he has a memory of these things    i d purchase again if i saw more rabbits  kept rabbits away from my lettuce  but doesn t last 30 days,1,0
544,i tried expensive wet cat foods to include evo which is the dry cat food we use  but my cats gave me dirty looks and refused to eat it   we tried at least 15 kids of wet cat food over the past couple of years and even tried feeding the cats straight fish  but when we d set anything new down in front of them  they would look at it and band together in a hunger strike   i would have fed them something more expensive if they would have eatten it  but this is what they want to eat   i give up   this is my cats  food forever  kato and dexter approved,1,0

1182,i debated how to rate cytomax   i used the product in the 90 s and loved it   when i went back to it i did not like the new taste  but it does work   i give it a 1 star for taste and 5 stars for how it works   if they wanted to introduce a low calorie option then they should have created a new product and not change the old product my solution for the taste is to add some sugar    tastes great   every 32oz of water i use 3 scoops of cytomax and then i ad 1 tbsp of sugar  2 if you want it super sweet    hope it helps you too  solution for new formula,1,0
553,i ordered   received exactly what i wanted  which was the  realemon  brand lemon juice packets   to ensure you get the right one  you need to order from the correct seller vendor   that seller is  great gifts for you to give  i mention this because some reviews indicate people received a different brand product then expected   i think this happens because people simply click  add to cart  when ordering the product  instead of doing that  look for   click on the link that shows other sellers   this will read something like  2 new from  8 49    there you will find the seller mentioned above   the overall cost is a few dollars more  but if you want the  realemon  brand  i recommend ordering from that vendor note  i did not try ordering from the amazon default seller  so i do not know for sure what brand you will would get if you order that way   hope this review helps  order from correct seller vendor to get realemon brand,1,0
1156,this stuff is an incredible value  the soda stream device is a complete rip off but if you add up 50 cans of red bull the cost would be anywhere from  150 200 which pays for the cost on the machine and then some with the savings of buying this syrup  the purchase of the machine is worth it but only if you like the energy syrup  otherwise go to walmart and buy a two liter of regular pop for a buck  keeps me wired ,1,0
1157,what can you expect from coffee in a can  i certainly did not have very high expectations  however  when i first tasted this illy coffee  i was surprised by its strong coffee flavor  i do like my coffee strong  unlike some other reviewers  i did not find the taste bitter  generally  i do not put sugar in my coffee  or anything else for that matter  so i did notice the sugary taste after trying the illy at room temperature  i decided that it would be fair to compare it with my usual hot coffee  so i poured the remaining liquid into a coffee cup and plopped it into the microwave  when heated  it was better than at room temperature  good coffee taste  but still too sweet this coffee drink has 10 grams of sugar per can  that is almost as much sugar as there is in a tablespoon of granulated sugar  which comes in at 13 grams  i would never put that much sugar in a single cup of coffee  some people may like it though  surprising,1,0
1158,for some reason  i had it in my head that this was iced coffee similar to a iced cafe mocha than a coke that lost its carbonation  i really don t know where i got that idea because the description is clear  coffee drink  caffe  still  it was a surprise when i poured it into a small cup with ice that it was dark like  you guessed it  coffee but instead of being disappointed at my unfounded assumption  i went ahead and took a sip and whoa  it was good mind you  i m not a coffee drinker unless one considers a bit of coffee with cream and sugar to be coffee  my expectations were low and yet  this drink was good  light  not too sweet  but not bitter either  at 6 8 oz  it was also the right size that it wasn t too much either  it was the perfect pick me up post lunch in fact i probably won t have this too much but i ll try to have it now and again  at 50 calories  it is a much better option for a post lunch treat than the iced white mocha that i get from a well known coffee chain so while this drink was different from what i expected  it was a good surprise and i will definitely buy again  surprisingly light and refreshing,1,0
1159,there s not a single thing wrong with this coffee  it leans more toward the darker  richer side but it s not overpowering  just buy it already  no complaints,1,0

551,look at buying cumin at your grocery store and then look at the bulk price  you cannot get ripped off like that  buy some bulk cumin and then put it in a big glass jar  that little plasic jar you buy it in is rediculous  put a couple of pieces of rice in the glass jar  it will soak up  the moisture and preserve it  frequently used buy bulk,1,0
1161,this is a great buy for great quality dill weed  why buy little one ounce jars for an outrageous price  one pound of dill weed  packaged in an air tight bag  fresh and full of aroma and taste  buy a bag and split it up amongst family or friends  or vacuum seal what you re not going to use right away  you won t be disappointed with this product  you may not know what to do with all of it  but you won t be disappointed in the amount  or the quality for the price  best dill ever,1,0
1162,i really couldn t be happier with my purchase   i wanted a variety pack to check out different flavors types brands of k cups so i could make better purchases when faced with buying a whole box of the same kind in the future i got 51 cups  i guess i got lucky  and only two of them were decaf   not a single duplicate k cup   some teas  standard roast coffees of different brands types  but the majority of them are flavored coffees   wolfgang puck  green mountain  donut shop  even a kahlua coffee   no issues with expiration dates  all seem to be well within range  earliest i found was october 2012  which is 4 months from now  i really think it s the luck of the draw on the type you get  but i was glad to see there weren t any duplicates   if there were two of the same  flavor  they were at least different brands   i ll probably buy another one of these when i run out  awesome variety ,1,0

1168,the shampoo is opaque  with a slightly pinkish color  it is very smooth and comes out of the bottle easily   note the bottle opens at the top  whereas that of the conditioner opens at the bottom  also the bottle is skinny  so it looks to hold more than its 12 9 fluid ounces or 381 milliliters   it did not irritate my scalp and was smooth to apply   if you have really filthy  greasy hair then dawn ultra dishwashing liquid  original scent  blue   24 ounce  pack of 2  would provide a stronger degreasing effect  but it could make the hair dry   so the shampoo has to be rubbed in for a while to remove dirt well  then the hair has to be rinsed to remove the bubbles and other shampoo ingredients i tried it twice   the first time i did not use conditioner   the second time  after i used the shampoo i used clear scalp   hair beauty volumizing root boost nourishing conditioner  12 7 fluid ounce   the shampoo was so creamy that i thought it might be possible to avoid using conditioner   the results were ok   my hair was not frizzy  however  with the conditioner it became quite shiny and silky i am not commenting on the toxicity or lack of toxicity of the ingredients   i am giving an ingredient list so readers can find what is in the product   the ingredients in common with clear scalp   hair beauty volumizing root boost nourishing conditioner  12 7 fluid ounce are aloe barbadensis leaf extractascorbic aciddimethiconoldmdm hydantoinfragranceglyceringlycine soja  soybean  oilhelianthus annus  sunflower  seed oilhydrogenated coconut oillysine hcimethychloroisothiaszolinonemethylisothiaszolinoneniacinamidepanthenolprunus amygdalus dulcis  sweet almond  oilred 33  cl 17200 sodium chloridetea dodecylbenzenesulfonatetocopheryl acetatewaterzinc pyrithionezinc sulphatethe ingredients in the shampoo and not in the conditioner are bismuth oxychloride  cl 77163 carbomercitric acidcocomidopropyl betainedimethiconeguar hydroxypeopyltrimonium chloridemica  cl 77019 poloxamer 407sodium isethionatesodium laureth sulfatesodium lauroyl isethionatestearic acidtallow acidtitanium dioxide  cl 77891 xanthan gumingredients in the conditioner and not in the shampoo are behentrimonium chloridecetearyl alcohol   emulsifier  foaming agentcyclopentasiloxane   silicone to stop hair breakingdimethylaminedipropylene  glycollactic acidpeg 150 distearatestearamidopropyli may have missed some ingredients in common as some ingredients have multiple names and shampoo labeling tends to be inconsistent as you can see there are multiple chemicals  the shampoo claims it has 10 vitamins and nutrients i prefer shampoos with simpler ingredient lists   despite various nut and seed oils  this is really a chemical based shampoo   however  the shampoo works well and provides a high quality wash  it does what it claims to do   repairs damage  with 4 coloring agents at least  that make the shampoo the same hue as the bottle   i assume it  repairs color    whatever that means i wish the ingredients weren t hidden under the label   as it was they came off with the label and i had to scan them from behind then reflect them in adobe photoshop cs4   old version to read them  smooth and creamy   feels nice,1,0

1179,i did not buy this from amazon after seeing the price   you can get it much cheaper at the big midwest box store  but  in indiana with the humidity and aphids wreaking havoc on my roses  i was desperate to find something that would not  burn  the leaves and new blooms like so many rose sprays do  you can use this on plants that are totally dry  no required water misting before  and you will see results the next day  i almost lost a whole row of bushes to the yellow and black spotty rose disease and this literally saved them overnight  the insect activity also stopped  i do not know how this would work in different climates  but it works wonders in a dry yet humid environment  this honestly works on roses ,1,0

547,this came in the mail the other day and my dog  miniature pinscher  was jumping all over it while i was unwrapping it  he can be picky with food and dog treats  but he s been eating this the past few days  so i d say it s a hit but i looked up info online today about best and worst dog foods  and sadly beneful is on all of the  worst  lists i saw  but then again  so is iams  and that is one i always used to see being sold and endorsed at the veterinarian s and humane societies  and always heard it was a good brand  so i really have no idea what or why one food is considered better than another  pedigree and purina are also on some of the lists  many of the brand names i see in the stores are  but i can t afford organic foods for my family and can t afford them for my pets either  guess i ll have to look more into it  it s up to your discretion on what you feel about it i take off one star just because i did not see this food on any of the  best  lists  but most of the foods on the bests lists were ones i had never heard of or seen before  dog approved,1,0

549,well  first off i should say that i m not new to tea   i m not sure i d describe myself as a  tea connoisseur  but i m pretty experienced with tea   i ve tried just about every type of tea out there  white  black  green  herbal  even puerh tea    and i regularly make my own custom blends using loose leaf herbs and spices   i m a pretty big fan of tea  so i naturally jumped at the chance to get some nice chai tea   i already have my own homemade chai recipes that involve simmering loose spices and adding in milk and sugar  and it s great  but i ve always wanted to try some plain chai without the milk so i got the higgins and burk chai in the mail and decided to brew myself a cup to try out   i steeped it a full 10 minutes because i steep all my tea for 10 minutes  i suspect a lot of people would find this too strong for their tastes  but that s how i like it    my first impressions of this tea is that it s pretty weak for a chai style tea   i felt like the strongest taste was the cloves  and it really could ve used stronger notes of ginger and cinnamon   not to mention  the black tea portion of it tastes a bit not so good to me   it s difficult to describe  but i ll explain it as best as i can   i once bought a huge box of cheap crappy pekoe black tea and it tasted terrible   it was just lacking in good flavor and only tasted of bitter tannins and blandness and nothing else   this tea is not nearly as bad as that one was  but the black tea portion of it seems to have a bit of that taste to it   i had my own assam tea  before i used it all and ran out  and it seemed to taste much better than this   even plain with nothing else in it   of course  it could ve been because of the source of my teas spices  i get everything from the mountainroseherbs website   maybe the tea is better from there   anyway  the other spices in the tea hide it well enough so it s not a big deal   i did decide to make my own homemade blend to see how it would turn out using the same ingredients  i used 2 parts black tea  1 2 part cinnamon  1 8 part cloves  1 8 part cardamom  and 1 2 part ginger    then i did a side by side taste test using the exact same amount of sweetener   the higgins and burke version is not terrible or anything  but i still think my version won by a small margin anyway  if you re a casual tea drinker  this tea will probably be fine for your tastes  and far more convenient than making your own loose leaf blends   in addition  if you are the sort who prefers a less spicy chai then this tea would be great   in the course of further usage  i also discovered that the higgins and burke tastes better as an iced tea   go figure   well  my overall opinion of the higgins and burke black chai is that it is a decent choice for anyone who wants a mild pleasant chai in a convenient tea bag option  but i think i m going to personally stick to my own homemade formula because i love making loose leaf tea blends  it s a decently pleasant tea   ,1,0
1174,i have two rhodesian ridgeback puppies  5mo   10mo  and they love the galileo bone in the  souper  size  they grab it with their two front paws and will knaw on it for a half hour straight  it seems like it will last for a long time and the more they chew it  the more they enjoy it  it doesn t make a mess when they re chewing  the ends fray into something like tooth brush scrubbers  but don t break off   i don t think the 5mo old would enjoy it as much if the 10mo old hadn t already started chewing it to create these scrubbers  it s probably best for dogs that have their adult teeth grown in  it would be too tough for the little one to knaw into a brand new one  i m ordering a second one so they don t have to share it anymore     the toy that lasts and lasts,1,0
616,i bought this olive oil because of the testing done by university california davis in early 2010   the results showed that this product passed for being extra virgin olive oil for all 3 samples  and it was the only imported oil to the united states of 14 tested that passed all 3 samples   it seems to be more potent  because it s spicier  than the  trader joe s organic brand which cost 40  less   you do know that about 80  of all extra virgin olive oil products are not 100  extra virgin olive oil   five stars because it s a decent price and i trust this product for being extra virgin more than other name brands this oil is from italy  which means this oil is milled in october or november or december  as with all northern hemisphere olive oils   the southern hemisphere olive oils are milled in june and july  really is extra virgin olive oil,1,0
1085,my puppy was losing hair and itching like crazy on the dry dog food from the grocery store  i bought one bag of this based on the reviews here and ellen s participation in the product  within two weeks he was eating half as much food  but gaining muscle mass and had a thick shiny coat  2 bags later and i decided to change to some other fancy brand that was supposed to be as good but much cheaper  the day after starting to change my puppy s food over  the new brand was recalled  halo is expensive  but i lost a dog due to the  06  07 recalls  never again  expensive but worth it ,1,0
1083,this is a great product   our dogs love this flavor   you can get this food at a way cheaper price elsewhere like pet people   don t waste your money   make sure you look around your local pet stores  way over priced ,1,0
604,it is so great to receive a natural product that has not been denatured  essential oils partially or wholly removed  these beans are the real thing   moist  plump and full of aroma and flavor two  2  beans in  mccormick  brand sell in walmart for nearly  10   that s  5 per bean   these are around  0 40 per bean  fully natured and unadulterated,1,0

991,i just ordered this product from amazon  and i very much like the taste   but as soon as i swallow the olive oil i   and others in my family   detect a burning sensation on the back of my throat   has anyone else experienced this   is this likely a production defect with my specific bottle  or is it a characteristic of the product itself   i have never had any other olive oil do this  anyone else get a burning sensation ,1,0
992,this delicate looking plant was sent to me as a gift  i am not sure i would have ever ordered it for myself  not really a big fan of the idea of  bonsai  the packing shipping materials kept it safe and sound  may want to open the box with a large trash bag around the box packing peanuts galore  it looked very healthy and happy  as some other reviews stated about a week after receiving the plant lots and lots of tiny black bugs showed up  i have other inside plants and lots of outside plants so of course didn t want the bugs to spread  i squirted watered down dish soap  just a drop or two to a spray bottle of water  a few times  let it sit outside when we had large rainstorms  it lost a good amount of leaves  could be the bugs or could be the soap   bugs died washed away  after a week  new leaves started growing back  i waited another week and left it outside in the shade  sunburns very easily   later repotted it in a large pot  it s doing great  even though it s been through the wringer  i hope this helps anyone who has any of these problems  tough little plant,1,0

996,we love this brand of coconut water  but our local grocery store only has the small glass 9 ounce bottles for  2 each  so we looked online for a cheaper alternative and found this canned version of the same brand  it tastes the same as the glass bottles  however the pulp is much differet  the pulp in the bottled version is very fine and drinkable  but the pulp in the can is large undrinkable chunks of actual hard coconut  so large it needs to be filtered out since there was a couple chunks in there large enough to choke on so i would recommend buying the canned kind without pulp  since it s not actually pulp so much as very large chunks of hard coconut  i m kind of wondering if i got a bad batch or something  different from glass bottle version,1,0
997,i just ordered my second purchase of this item i saw other people s reviews and i was surprised i have been using nutrasweet for years  it has the same ingredients as equal but half the price i have a packet from my previous purchase of sweet mate  it says in ingredients  dextrose with maldextrin  aspartame  aspartame is the main sweetener ingredient   that is the same ingredients as equal it is half the price that i pay for nutrasweet in store  and a whole lot less than equal  same ingredients as equal,1,0
603,first  i am a big fan of arctic zero   the strawberry flavor is probably the truest to form taste wise  as it really does take like strawberry ice cream   it has the right amount of sweetness  whereas  for my taste  some of the other flavors do not   arctic zero is like ice cream  but then it s kind of not like ice cream  it s very hard to explain  but there s more ice than cream to it  if you follow me  however  these are great  low calorie treats  and you really can polish off a pint and not feel terrible about yourself  rather true to form   right amount of sweetness,1,0
602,i fell in love with fresh coconut water while teaching in vietnam   this is the closest i have found in the states   no sugar added   just coconut water   i bought two cases at the pacific ocean market in denver  but that is 250 miles away   price was  24 00 a case   interested to see what it will cost on amazon with shipping  compares to fresh,1,0
999,i gave it 4 stars because it is covered with arabic words  i don t know if they are old  if they were sent there and sat on a shelf for months  i have no clue as much as i love them  i will not buy from this seller again  i want to read my products in my own language  crunchies are awesome,1,0

601,when we first adopted our lab border collie mix at eight months old  she was extremely underweight and had constant diarrhea  we didn t know what was wrong  we tried science diet and iams  but she wouldn t eat them  her weight loss and diarrhea continued  we finally got her to start eating purina with chunks of meat in it  and she finally started gaining weight  her diarrhea improved a little bit  but her fur was thin and dull and she didn t seem as healthy as she should be  i did some research on grain free foods and switched her over to this formula  immediately her diarrhea went away  she gained weight even faster  and now instead of skin and bones  she is a beautiful slender dog with tons of energy  the sweet potato acts as a natural stool hardener  and no grain makes it easy to digest  her fur is thick  shiny  and luxurious like it should be  wonderful food  excellent healthy food,1,0
1005,i like this and i am switching  although i will continue to buy some nespresso capsules    as well as illy capsules for my illy machine upstairs it is hard to predict who will like the ecc coffees and who will not  many things contribute to the experience  and not even just taste  aroma  and looks  i am from italy  and lived in one of the italian  coffee capitals     trieste  home of illy  hausbrandt  san giusto  and others      i suggest you try this without bias and with neutral expectations  if yr experience is positive  you are lucky and this coffee will save you money  and the earth some environmental grief one suggestion to keep you honest in testing the new coffee  don t just compare the espressivo and yr choice of nespresso side by side    do a blind test  with two cups that are exactly alike  the same amount of sugar  if any  try both coffees in sequence  ask an accomplice to keep track of which cup contains which coffee  and see what the test reveals  taste is personal,1,0

1007,clear scalp   hair beauty total care nourishing shampoo might actually live up to its advertising i am a senior citizen with long  thin  fine hair  my usual shampoo cleans my hair just fine  however  the clear shampoo did much more  the shampoo thickened each strand of hair  normally it takes at least 15 minutes for me to comb out the tangles  not with this clear shampoo  five minutes after my hair was dry  i had it combed out and braided  since i ve used the shampoo only once  i can t tell if it will improve the condition of my scalp as much as it has my hair  but i am eager to discover the effect there as well one caution  if you travel with this shampoo  seal it in a plastic bag  the shampoo was delivered to me in a box containing no other items  in spite of that  the shampoo container managed to leak all over the plastic bag in which it was sealed  the flip open top on the shampoo bottle cannot be sealed  first impressions,1,0
1008,i had ordered the miss beauty desert rose   according to the picture  the flower clearly has red boarders with a distinct white center   i received my plant about a month ago  which came in decent condition  understandably most of the leaves had yellowed and fallen due to shock   potted the plant  and it has been responding well   since then  i had ordered three more different types of desert roses from this seller   i have waited a month now for the plant to finally bloom  i live in nyc  where the climate is not ideal   and to my dismay  the flower is the usual pink and not the red one pictured   i am going to give the seller 2 stars for now  as i am waiting for a response on how this can be rectified  update  the seller has contacted me in a timely manner and has offered to give me a full refund or to send me the plant i wanted at no charge   i m crossing my fingers and hope that all will work out smoothly   from 2 to now 5 stars  i can t ask for anything more   plus the other adeniums i ordered are all doing well  although they just haven t bloomed yet   if they all turn out to be what i ordered  i will definitely order from this seller again  beautiful plant  but not miss beauty,1,0
1009,i ve used a lot of hot sauce in my day and this is at the top of the list    it has a great flavor  however if your looking for something that well burn you mouth this may not be it   it s about as hot as tabasco but i rank it a little higher in flavor  i want to drink it ,1,0
1010,i ve tried this one and also the illy cappachino mocha version  which is a slightly larger can    i thought the mocha version seemed to mask the taste of the illy coffee and make it a bit generic   however this one seemed to be be much closer to espresso taste   quite strong  albeit not bitter  espresso taste  which prevents you from chugging the small 6 8oz can  and instead savoring it in smaller sips overall i think these are quite a bit of money for what you get  but the cans are small  they taste good  and much cheaper better than the equivalent starbucks version  good taste  bit pricey,1,0
1011,this was my go to coffee for the last year   it is for the most part very fresh  oily shiny beans  i have only received 1 bag that was not fresh and 1 bag that looked like it was accidentaley cut open with a box cutter   however i just recently cancelled my s s on this item as the price has steadily increased over the last year   i can get a better deal at my local costco  2 lbs for  13 00  on decent coffee   if amazon is able to get the price down i will be back and will resubscribe   it s just really unfortunate that the price has increased so much     overall my rating is on the coffee itself and not on the price   so if your in the market for a delicious well balanced coffee that s organic   i highly recommend cameron s  great coffee  beware price has increased  ,1,0

599,this coffee drink is a chilled espresso  so one s expectation should be that it is espresso strength   i d rate it as equivalent to a single shot of espresso   it provides a nice little jolt and tastes the way i think chilled espresso should taste for the most part  illy caffe hits the mark in the canned coffee category   coca cola  the manufacturer  added sugar to the drink  so that may put some people off   for me  while the sugar was discernible  i did not find that it made the drink overly sweet 50 calories  not 45 as the amazon ad states   i prefer to drink illy caffe ice cold  not too weak  but not super strong   best cold ,1,0

986,higgins and burke makes a decent earl grey  it has a splendid burst of bergamot coupled with a rich blend of black teas i like tea that has the ability to hold up to milk and sugar  even if i m not having it with either  i often choose to not put milk in earl grey  but even then i still want it to have some pluck  this tea has pluck  granted  it is not an irish breakfast but then there is a reason for that   if you filled a bag full of assam then you would overpower the bergamot some teas can achieve that strength by filling their bags full of fannings  that is not what higgins and burke are doing  i took apart one of the bags to check  they are using real tea leaves  they aren t using fannings nor are they using crush to curl i rate this as one of the better bagged earl greys  a reliable cup,1,0
985,when i began to write this review  two things came to mind  1  sweden is not a country you normally associate with coffee  2  coffee is generally hard to score because taste is subjective furthermore  sweden is not a coffee grower so gevalia is going to be a company like starbucks who buys  roasts  blends and packages their coffee  old victor theodore engwall might have started this company in 1853 but it has been owned by kraft since 1971 and i just hope that kraft is not going to do the same as gm did to saab or ford to volvo   lastly  this is a house blend  100  arabica   something i usually avoid because it s just someone s mixture of a few different kinds of coffee  if i m going to drink blended coffee  i would prefer to blend my own  but i got this as a gift so i decided to write a review anyway anyhoo    this is a surprisingly good coffee  the pouch lists this medium dark roast  3 out of 4 beans on their scale  but it s very light to me  and i m using a little bit more coffee than it suggests  but i like it  i also used it to make a latte and it s rich and creamy  i wouldn t say this was bitter at all overall  i d say this is a pretty light flavorful coffee  good quality  not burnt  not bitter   this is definitely a coffee i would buy and drink in rotation with my other coffees  gevalia has a good reputation in scandinavia and thereabouts and i m glad that kraft hasn t screwed it up  gevalia house blend   ,1,0

961,i began looking for this product from amazon after my local wfms stopped carrying it and i wasn t able to find it anyplace else in my home area  many years ago  perhaps as many as 40  i used to buy and enjoy the original familia swiss muesli  based on the recipe of doctor bircher benner  a few years later  i moved to a remote location where it was difficult to find familia for sale  when i returned to  civilization  again  i discovered that the familia company had seemingly changed their recipe  it was no longer the same texture that i had remembered from before  it was as if they had removed the finest particles of the cereal or whatever it was that had quickly absorbed the milk  and seemed also to be a higher percentage of rolled oats  as a result  the muesli took longer to soften to the desired consistency and just didn t have the same feel in the mouth when i discovered familia original baby muesli a few years ago  its blend of fine ingredients reminded  me of what was missing from the  new  familia formulation  i quickly found that i could mix the baby familia with the  adult  familia  in about a one to two proportion  and approximate what i recall as the original cereal blend  i now enjoy familia muesli cereal the way i remember it if buying it here in quantities of six boxes at a time  i suggest storing the extra in the freezer or refrigerator  baby familia is not just for kids,1,0
962,i have an exotic cat breed and have tried all the expensive organic dry foods as she has a sensitive system  the litter box was horrendous and left us all wanting to leave the house for hours  plus her bms were so runny and even had blood in it  which the vet said was due to the harshness of the food  so i went to wet food  ideally i would love to serve raw but i just don t have the time  so i started out with the big name super market brands  but not only did they make her box worse  they were unappetizing to even look at  just mush  so i went to the local mom and pop pet store and looked around  i found a couple cans of tiki cat and for under a buck each so i said why not  i took it home  gave her one and we are hooked  i love that its real fish with no added junk  you can see and smell whats in it  my cat meows for this  i did not buy from amazon but i do get the multipack auto shipped through another site  i wish they would expand their fish flavors though  seems to be mostly tuna and sardines  which are rather chunky so she sometimes has an issue chewing them   but im just happy that her poo is actually normal  virtually smell free  and she seems so much more active and playful  about time ,1,0
963,when i opened the package  i only found 11 packets of the honey stingers  there should have been 12  i counted and re counted 4 times to be sure  the packets were in a thin cardboard display box  wrapped in a sealed plastic bag  and shipped in a sturdy cardboard box  i don t really want to go through the hassle of returning the item  so i guess i m out a pack   it d be nice if amazon shipped me one more packet      love these  but only got 11 of 12 packets ,1,0

610,this product is not a organic energy drinka replacement for your centrum silvera replacement for flinstone vitaminsthis product  imho  is more like a way to turn your bottled water into an energy drink  another example of a product in this category is zipfizz after reading all the negative reviews of this product i had really low expectations  but i was pleasantly surprised  it tasted decent  no better or worse than most energy drinks   the mixture i made gave me heaps of caffeine induced energy and alertness the only problem i had was that it s hard to measure what a  squeeze  is  after i did my  squeeze  into my water  i looked at the lines on the side of the bottle and saw that i had actually  squeezed  four servings into my glass  at this rate  the bottle that is supposed to have 24 servings is only going to last me about 6 servings  what is odd is that my drink seemed to have just enough flavor for what i squirted in  perhaps i used more water that the recommended amount just as a heads up  one serving of this product has 40mg of caffeine  or roughly that of a diet coke  two servings would be about the same as a red bull  and my four serving dose is about the same as a medium starbucks drip coffee  here s what to expect ,1,0
967,i hit 21 and for some reason started developing food allergies left and right   several years later and there are so many foods  including  but not limtited to all tree nuts  sunflower and safflower seeds oil  oats  red berries and sulfates  that set me off terribly and with increasing sensitivity chocolate seemed to be one of the new aggressors and i ve been trying to tough it out with carob  but it just doesn t cut it for me i had an epiphany when i saw these in the store and wondered it could possibly be all the junk chocolate can get processed with or shared equiptment that was setting me off success   i tried a little  waited  nothing happened  repeated the next day  with a couple of table spoons and again  no excema  throat swelling or digestive problems  which never hesitate to make them selves known if i have a problem with a food not that i recomend trial and error to people who think they are allergic to anything  though that is what my doctors came up with for my specific case  and i m really exicited that i didn t react going to probably buy these in bulk and try not to go crazy after 3 months of trying to like carob seriously though  in the non allergic epoch of my life  i was a chocolate snob   if i wanted chocolate i would splurge on a three dollar bar of the good stuff and avoided hersey s like the plague  i m not sure how much of my present taste is colored by desperation and deprevation but i think this stuff is really good  i can eat chocolate again  ,1,0

969,for some reason i am not getting a very high germination rate with these seeds   it seems that about 25  do not sprout   i soak them for 8 hours at first then rinse them every morning and evening   maybe i got a bad batch or maybe they are old seeds but i will order from someone else next time i would like to update this review   i believe the problem i had with these seeds had to do with the weather   i live in a humid area of brazil   when i first started using these seeds it was summer here and i had a poor germination rate   now the weather has cooled and i am getting a very good germination rate   although i rinsed these twice a day and the weather was very humid  it could be that they dried out too much   i would not be afraid to purchase these again and i am sorry if i caused anyone not to purchase these with my previous review   if i can i will change my rating to 5 stars   i always try to be honest and if i make a mistake i try to correct it   i count a lot on the reviews of others when i make a purchase so i want mine to be correct   enjoy  a revision,1,0
970,think of this as a candy snack bar rather than a granola bar and you will not be disappointed  it s very sweet and tasty  but there s little or no nutritional value in here  despite being made from oats  the product is heavily processed and definitely what anyone would call healthy  made with natural and artificial flavors  the ingredients list is very long  see bottom of review   it s loaded with sugar and not something you want to give yourself or your kids on a regular basis  note how many times sugar or its variants appear in the list  glucose  fructose  each bar is 1 23 oz  daily value  fiber 1g  5    vitamin a  0    vitamin c  0    calcium  10    iron  2    150 calories per bar  40 from fat   11g of sugar  i m giving the product 4 stars based on taste and texture  it s chewy  but not hard like nature valley granola bars ingredients  granola  whole grain rolled oats  whole grain rolled wheat  brown sugar  sunflower oil  high fructose corn syrup  dried coconut  honey  sodium bicarbonate  natural flavor  whey and whey protein concentrate   yogurt flavored coating  sugar  palm kernel and palm oil  whey protein concentrate  yogurt flavored powder  soy lecithin  natural flavor  artificial color  citric acid  salt   corn syrup  high fructose corn syrup  brown rice crisp  whole grain brown rice  sugar  malted barley flour  salt   brown sugar  glycerin  vegetable shortening  canola oil  palm and palm kernel oils   corn flakes  milled corn  sugar  salt  malted barley extract   whey mineral concentrate  oat flour  rice flour  sweetened dried strawberries  glucose syrup  strawberries  high fructose corn syrup  modified potato starch  sodium alginate   corn syrup solids  sorbitol  salt  sugar  modified food starch  soy lecithin  natural flavor  malted barley flour  sodium bicarbonate  bht  a preservative   citric acid  water made in canada  very tasty  but not healthy or nutritious,1,0

971,i ordered this for my boyfriend for father s day  the food was disgusting  we didn t even bother trying the  black taffy   which was nothing more than very bad licorice  the next were some kind of nuts with a sweet shell around them  they were disgusting  they had no flavor and what flavor they did have tasted a bit like dirt  the next two things were chocolate chip cookies and some other type of cookie  we figured how bad can they screw up a chocolate chip cookie    well they were dry and tasted horrible  i ended up throwing out everything  and you have to understand we don t throw out food  at all  i was terribly disappointed  i just figured that i trusted amazon  so i should be able to trust the products they sell  this was not the case after leaving complaint with this company they refunded my money and were very helpful  fixed,1,0
984,this was a rather intense shot of caffinated adrenaline that actually took me by surprise  as this is an espresso drink the flavor might not be for those who don t like bitter   prefer sweet  however if you are looking for a rather immediate caffeine boost than this will certainly do the trick  a real shot in the arm ,1,0

606,someone in our neighborhood allows his her cats to roam freely   often  the cats favor our front lawn and shrubbery   we ve tactfully mentioned this to those neighbors who have pet cats  but the problem has persisted   with the milder spring weather and windows open  the smell resulting from cats relieving themselves on our property has become a constant irritation   after diplomacy failed  we decided to tackle the problem ourselves critter ridder has been terrific   the first thing to note is that the granules should be scattered when the lawn and shrubs are dry  so you shouldn t get overly ambitious after a heavy rain   product instructions suggest spreading granules every 30 days or after heavy rains the product contains all natural materials which undesirable animals will find unpleasant to smell  taste  and touch   these ingredients include oil of black pepper  capsaicin  and pipeline   the product does not have an unpleasant odor for humans and is not harmful to kids   for folks who want to rectify a quality of life problem without permanently harming offending creatures  critter ridder is the answer please read the directions before just spreading the granules   it s recommended  for instance  that gloves are worn during the process of spreading   also  the directions tell precisely how much product should be used for it to be effective  goodbye neighborhood cats ,1,0
982,i feel like this product assists me in weight management as well as gives my body a real boost of antioxidents  137x that of standard green tea  wow     i feel healthier and feel more cleansed on the inside  if that makes sense   i have not been drinking the 3 cups per day as recommended via the instructions  and via dr  oz  but rather drink 1 to 2  cups   by this  i mean that i consume 1 gram per serving which is equivelant to 1 8 tsp  it is a powder  not a tea bag or loose leaf tea   it tastes gross  unless you like the taste of grass  so i just slam it quickly  you want to use hot water because it tends to be clumpy  and the hotter the water  the more mixed it becomes  i suppose the clumpiness doesn t matter  other than it s harder to consume  i will be purchasing again  hope this helps  works but tastes gross  still worth it though ,1,0
981,although this tea tastes great  it s just an instant tea mix that get completely dissolved  k cup gets empty   i still really like it  and drink it  just not that often  the taste is reminiscent of pumpkin spice tea  it s rather sweet tasting  it may have artificial sweeteners in it  i m not sure  but i think other reviewers mentioned it   great taste  but it s not a real tea,1,0
980,i  for the life of me  can not understand the one star reviews given to this great campbells soup   i love many of the  chunky soup  line but this one is my  all time  favorite     i even like a cold leftover can right out of the fridge    yummy   i guess we all sense flavors differently  but to me and i believe most people  this soup would be judged truly delicious       no   bland it definitely aint   bland    it aint      ,1,0
1019,i did not buy these from amazon  but apparently will in the future   i was in my local membership required big box store  am i allowed to say costco   when i saw this stuff for about 27 cents per serving   since it s very easy to return stuff there  i bought it   as others have commented  it s unusual looking  in that just the familiar looking k cup ring and foil at the top are there   the plastic cup around the bottom is missing   but that doesn t matter and it actually creates less waste and probably costs less to manufacture off course  being green doesn t matter if the coffee tastes bad   in this case  it does not   it s got to be one of the two best french roast k cups i have ever had   full of flavor  without being bitter or burnt   i went back to the store a few days later and they had sold out and they are not sure of plans to get more  so it looks like i will continue to buy my coffee from amazon  but instead of my usuall brand  green mountain french roast   i will be buying these  great tasting  less waste,1,0
979,i first experienced these when a co worker brought some in to work   then  others picked up on it  and there was an unscripted effort to continually have a jar of them on someone s desk in the area the one thing that strikes me is having paid four or five dollars for this at the local target store  archer s distributor   oddly  archer lists target com on the jar  but once you re at target com  the site informs you that this item is not sold online   you must pick it up at the store  tasty  but    ,1,0

975,i m not a big cold coffee drinker  but occasionally i have a taste for coffee and don t particularly feel like warming up  that s when i ll have a can of coffee like this illy issimo  i like the taste of this product because it isn t too sweet   i normally take my coffee with sweetener and creamer of some kind   it s just sweet enough to make it tasty for me  but not so cloyingly sweet that the coffee taste can t come through  the coffee flavor is rich and creamy  more or less what you would expect of a cappuccino  what you wouldn t expect with this low level of sweetness in a coffee  however  is the high level of calories  100 for a 8 ounce can   that s maybe not a deal breaker  but it s a far cry from the 20 calories of a regular cup of coffee with splenda essentials no calorie sweetener with antioxidants  80 count box   pack of 4  and a non dairy creamer  still  the taste is good and i like the convenience and size of this can  so i m okay giving it a four star rating  not bad  ummm  no  good ,1,0
974,brownie says she likes this food and big red is willing to eat it but prefers canned  what does my opinion matter if the cats say yes  however  i do have an opinion on the dry companion product  filet mignon flavor with real seafood and shrimp  the cats really liked that flavor but i won t buy it because it has a food coloring    in it which turns the carpet pink when brownie upchucks on the carpet  if you have a regularly upchucking cat you might want to choose this flavor and avoid the filet mignon flavor  cats  review,1,0

978,baby liked the flavor of this just fine  and seemed to really gulp it down and eat a little more of it than the regular formula she usually drinks   maybe due to the added sugar in it    which i didn t know about when i purchased it  this did cause minor constipation though  and that was alternating between this  and the regular formula  so i m wondering if i had been feeding her only this  if the constipation would ve been major  it s really disappointing  but the formula we are using now works great for us  so that s what matters most  caused minor constipation,1,0

1020,short version  cat diagnosed with diabetes  insulin   hill s prescription food not stabilizing glucose levels despite increasing insulin weekly over 4 weeks  switched food to fancy feast classic turkey and giblets feast  glucose levels normal after 1 week  decreased insulin dose dramatically  glucose still stable  may go off insulin completely soon  thank you fancy feast  please read full review below to learn why you should start feeding your cat  even if healthy  only fancy feast classic turkey  chicken  beef  or another wet food that has practically no plant based ingredients and has less than 10  of the calories from carbohydrates even if your cat isn t diabetic please read this review and the wealth of information by a vet at catinfo org  my 12 year old cat was diagnosed with diabetes about 2 months ago  he is a big cat and about a year ago he weighed 22 pounds  two months ago we noticed that he looked thin  so we took him to the vet  they discovered that he had lost 7 pounds  a third of his body weight in one year   was walking on his forepaws  and based on this checked his blood glucose  it was around 450  which is more than 400  higher than the normal level of less than 100 the vet followed the normal procedure for treating diabetic cats  insulin and  prescription  cat food  hill s md  dry   she did talk me into lantus insulin  which is new  and more expensive   but has a chance of stimulating your cat s beta cells to start producing insulin again we started my cat on 3 units of insulin  twice daily  i fed him the exact amount of hill s i was supposed to  came back for checkup a week later  glucose still off the charts  up d insulin to 4 units twice daily  recheck  still through the roof  up d insulin to 5 units  at this point wife and i started reading online and found wealth of info at catinfo org by a vet who specializes in treating diabetic cats  this vet is a crusader of sorts against the horrible diet we feed our cats  cats are obligate  strict  carnivores  this means there diet should be almost 100  protein and fat  from animal ingredients  your cat should have no more than 10  of there calories from carbohydrates  dry food  of even the best quality  contains much more carbs than your cat should have  we discovered the hill s food we were feeding had about 17  carbs  the canned version is about the same  so don t be fooled  after doing much comparison  we settled on fancy feast classic turkey   giblets  because   1  has only about 6  calories from carbs  2  first ingredient is turkey  other ingredients are liver   by products  that is  proteins   fat  3  it is sold everywhere  unlike high end canned foods  4  it is less expensive than high end canned foods  5  unlike the fancy feast classic chicken or beef  it has no fish  looking at  2  you may think  eww   by products   but for a cat  animal by products  which are protein and fat from an animal  are better than plant based proteins and much better than carbs  looking at  5   cats should not be fed fish very often  because the trace amounts of mercury in fish will build up in your cats body over time  but if your cat won t eat the turkey  the chicken or beef would be the next best options  make sure it is the classic style  as the other fancy feast brands have too many carbs back to my cat  so now we were up to 5 units of insulin  twice a day  recheck  glucose still above 400  i tell my vet that we are switching to fancy feast and she agrees to keep insulin at 5 units  recheck a week later  glucose levels completely normal  go down to 4 units  twice daily  recheck  still normal  down to 3 units  twice daily  still normal we are now down to 3 units of insulin  once a day  there is a good chance he will be off the insulin completely in the next few weeks  my cat has gained 2 pounds  has stopped drinking water and urinating constantly  and acts four years younger  another bonus  on the expensive dry food we used to feed him he would throw up almost every single day  now he only throws up occasionally when he has a hair ball  we also now feed are 18 year old cat this food only  she seems much more spry and happy i know this is just one anecdote  although there are more on the web  and that the lantus insulin may be the real reason for this turn of events  but i do believe personally that it was fancy feast that saved my cat  saved my diabetic cat s life,1,0
1023,it would be very hard to purchase any other brand of split peas after having had the pleasure of tasting these  each pea is perfect  no imperfect ones to toss out  the final result is mouthwatering  i made a big pot  threw in some vegetables  and can barely keep myself away from having too much now and not enough left for another day and  being organic and gmo free  wrapped very carefully in gunny sack material inside a plastic bag  it is a healthful contributory to the diner  not a questionable one i m really glad i discovered these split peas  i can t imagine anything better  the best of the best,1,0
1058,these taste wonderful and as long as you look before popping bits into your mouth  you can avoid the additional roughage of core parts and stems   sadly  i need the dried fruit for making up fried pies and the work of separating  core  stem and skin from the fruit makes this a product i will not be a repeat customer for  great but not perfect,1,0
588,yes  i got my box for free  i probably wouldn t have bought it  there are too many cereals i like to bother with one i might or might not like  right my concerns were two fold  first  would they be sweet enough  i don t need sugar coated cereal  but i don t want to eat cardboard  either  and second  tight woven cereals like this tend to suck up all the milk  so they ll start off too dry  but end up too soggy  could this cereal overcome those concerns in a word  yes the flavor was sweet  the squares started off crunchy  but not too rough  and they did not suck up the milk like a sponge  so they weren t too soggy at the end  either i still have other cereals that i like better  but i ll likely occasionally buy this one  too  quite good,1,0
1059,so before i ordered this i was reading the reviews worrying about how some people said that when they got the coffee it was already or close to expiring not true  i got mine today  june 16th  and mine are going to expire march 28th 2013 and also people said that the coffee packets came in all messed up and it looked like they just threw it in the box not true  mine came in a amazon box and inside is another box and the receipt  inside the smaller box is the via container that is just like the picture  all little packets were still inside the starbucks packet i would def ignore all those negative comments because this is a pretty good product to order     don t listen to the negative reviews,1,0
1060,nice sweet  robust flavor   not too bold  but not too weak also   i ve had better peaberry coffee blends  but this 5 lb  bag is a fair price and a good deal   this blend is good for the price and you won t be disappointed  nice sweet  robust flavor,1,0
1062,i tried these in my senseo machine due to the unavailability of their brand of coffee pods   several attempts and finally got a decent cup of coffee   if you use the single holder and wet the pod first you get stronger coffee with the foam   these hold more coffee and you get water blow by if they are dry   weak nasty brown stuff that no one would want to drink   tried the double holder with similar results   got the idea for wetting them off the internet   wish i could give the person credit who figured it out  finally figured it out,1,0
586,the metal ring around the container will make buzzing sound while the item being microwaved   it s a little scary but i can t get rid of the metal ring the heated beefaroni is tasty  not too salty  got lots of salt but not to a point to burn my lips  and having decent flavor don t expect anything gourmet   it s just a quick 220 calorie savory snack   i put a few in the office in case i got hungry   i have yet to eat it without heating but i think it should taste ok without heating   in that case  it can be a good backpacking or hiking fuel source  not bad,1,0

1068,    first  this drink  illy issimo coffee drink  caff egrave   6 8 ounce cans  pack of 12   definitely tastes like coffee as opposed to  say  tea or ketchup or turkey gravy   also  because i m a bit of a coffee connoisseur  grind my own beans  ingeniously mix various varieties  use a chemex 10 cup classic glass coffee maker  that sort of thing   i think i stand on pretty firms grounds here when i say this no standard brew haha   it is much nearer the bitter end of the scale yet it is also sweet   i don t know about you  but  first  to me the very idea of adding sugar to coffee is like adding honey to tea or ketchup to a bratwurst or turkey gravy to a filet mignon   i like it speaking of which  according to the description on the amazon page this product is  sweetened with beet  sic  sugar    first  i think they mean  beaten  sugar  not  beat sugar    that would be like saying molt lava instead of molten lava   also  they spelled  beat  wrong anyway   sheesh   i don t subtract any stars for this  i just thought it was worth noting     price erroras of this writing there s another error in the description   you get 12 6 8 ounce cans for  24 13  which is said to be 29 cents per ounce   but if you do the math you get quite a different result oh heck  here  let me do it for you 6 8 ounces time 12 cans equals 81 6 ounces    24 13 times 100 equals 2 413 cents   2 413 cents divided by 81 6 ounces per 12 pack equals exactly 29 5710784313725490196 cents per ounce   where the least significant 16 digits repeat  and also which the decimal portion of which is equal to exactly 233 divided by 408  which as if you didn t know  as we round that number to less and less precision we discover that the 7 in the hundredths place forces the 5 in the tenths place to round up to 6   and if you round 29 6 cents to some integral unit you are forced to round up to 30 cents  you may not round down to 29 cents first  this is just plain false advertising   i find it interesting  nay  suspicious  that the error just happens to be in the manufacturer s favor   if you were to order a million cans of illy issimo coffee drink  caff egrave   6 8 ounce cans  pack of 12  that difference would make a difference  and here s the proof a million cans at 6 8 ounces per can   6 800 000 ounces   at the incorrect stated price of 29 cents per ounce  the total would be 197 200 000 cents  which is  1 972 000   but in fact  as i m sure you ll remember  the price is 29 5710784313725490196  cents per ounce  which results in a total price for a million cans of  2 010 833 3333   29     408   433       6 800 000  201 083 333 333 cents   2 010 833 33that s a difference of a whopping  38 833 33   i don t know about you  but every time someone asks me whether i want a discount of nearly  39 000  i always say that i very much do now  i m not saying that if you place an order for a million cans of this product and promise to pay up front in cash the manufacturer won t consider offering you some sort of deal  maybe throw in a free coca cola mouse pad or something   i m just saying that the price per ounce as stated on the amazon description page is incorrect  and i m curious as to why   whatever the answer is  i don t see how it can be satisfactory   so first  if you find out  let me know by composing a comment at the bottom of this review     caffeineaccording to the mayo clinic web site  an 8 4 ounce can of red bull contains 76 to 80 milligrams of caffeine  which i will hereby fearlessly average to 78   78 mg divided by 8 4 is 9 2857 mg per ounce   the product under review contains 155 mg of caffeine per 6 8 ounce can  which works out to 22 7941 mg per ounce  so the percentage by which illy issimo is more caffeinated is calculated like this  22 7941   9 2857    9 2857  13 5084   9 2857  1 455so  despite what any previous or future reviewer might putatively or may allegedly say or have said  this illy issimo contains about 145  more caffeine per ounce than red bull but first  maybe we should be more interested in the total caffeine per can  not per ounce  because most people aren t going to choose between drinking all of a 6 8 ounce can of illy issimo on the one hand and  in  er  on the other hand  drinking only 80 95  of an 8 4 ounce can of red bull  most people are going to drink all of whichever can they happen to have at hand   if that s what we re measuring  here s the math  155 mg   78 mg    78 mg  77   78  0 98717 98 7 98 7  is so close to 1 that what this means is that you get the same number of milligrams of caffeine from a can of red bull as from a can of illy issimo     the namespeaking of which  the name illy issimo is multiply confusing   first  it doesn t have any capital letters  which i secretly regard as presumptuous but for which i subtract no stars  although in a better world i would   it begs a typical speaker of english to think the first part of it refers the word ill  which means you re sick  i e   you have some medical condition you wish you didn t have  which seems like a poor choice for the first name of a product designed for the sole purpose of being ingested into the body the whole word  illy  is indeed the legitimate if somewhat unusual adjectival form of that word ill   illy means poorly or badly  as in   her review of that product was illy received by the manufacturer  or  more or less literally depending on how you interpret it    he performed illy on his first autopsy  that first word illy  especially because it is uncapitalized  begs native speakers of english to fill in a first letter  and the choices are billy  dilly  filly  hilly  and silly   i ll tell you that the first possibility that popped into my own personal mind was silly with all these problems potentially in english speakers  minds  i my own personal self would have voted against the choice of the word illy to headline the name of this product or any other  if i had been asked  which i wasn t  which is no doubt why it is named what it is  which is no good reason to subtract any stars  which i won t still     kosher illy issimo coffee drink  caff egrave   6 8 ounce cans  pack of 12  is declared to be  kosher certified    first and most important  that means if you restrict yourself to cans of coffee that have been kashered  you may safely drink this product without risking any bad outcomes that would arise if you didn t i don t know about you  but i don t want my diet controlled by centuries dead people    people who couldn t possibly have had access to all the information that s now available about foods and nutrition    who espoused antediluvian rules that proscribe meat that comes from  any animal that has cloven hoofs and doesn t ruminate   which excludes from their prescribed diet such extraordinarily useful food as pigs   that so many people in 2012 refuse to eat pork products is astonishing to me   and i don t want my diet controlled by a rule that dairy products and meat may not meet  which i m pretty sure 100  rules out a properly prepared cheddar cheeseburger  which i m pretty sure i will never rule out of my life as long as i can operate an outdoor grill or a simple stove   i m sure i should  by which i mean i m sure i should forgo the cheese  but not for illy and capricious reasons but rather for health reasons  but the point is that this product is kosher  so if you care about that then you have my blessing to go nuts i award 4 stars because this product delivers what it says it will unless you order a million cans  in which case you re out  38 833 33     did you

1076,after suffering from ibd   inflammatory bowel disease for a number if years  i discovered  to my horror   that the synthetic ingredient  carrageean and guar gum were a major reason why i had this disorder   carrageean and guar gum are known carcinogens and contribute to inflammatory conditions in the intestines   read the report in cornucopia org since eliminating all foods that contained these ingredients  specifically  carrageean  my small intestine and colon have begun to heal   for years  my doctors thought my inflammation was allergy related or wheat or gluten related   i now suspect it was the synthetic carageean  ingredient  google the dangers of  carrageean and you will understand how it inflames your colon and contributes to ibd  ibs  crohns  uc and colon cancer   the horrible ingredient is also in some milk and dairy products and pet food   please read all labels before buying products anyway  this coconut milk is a bit more challenging to use  yes  but it tastes great and you know only coconut is the ingredient so it won t inflame your gut which is more than i can say about the other coconut milks i ve researched   most contain that horrible carrageean ingredient i now stay away from   read every label peace great for ibs  ibd and crohns disease  does not contain carageean or guar gum which can inflame intestines,1,0
1077,i like the san francisco bay cups because they have a  paper  bottom  which means less plastic  better for the environment        i think the paper allows more water to flow through  thus the coffee is a bit stronger   they appear to be a bit less expensive also  which makes sense since there is less plastic  less waste,1,0

580,my daughter is allergic to peanuts  tree nuts and sunflower seeds  we have tried other soy nut butters but found them pretty much disgusting in flavor and texture   this one is by far the best and my daughter actually requests eating it on apples  bananas  and bread   the texture is creamy  not at all chalky or dry   it has a roasted flavor which is what makes it taste the most similar to peanuts   while i wouldn t say it tastes exactly like peanut butter  it has a nice flavor   i also like sunflower seed nut butters but unfortunately we found out the hard way that my daughter was allergic to those too  best nut seed butter alternative,1,0

1080,my sons  11  7  hate drinking water no matter how much i insist that they do  i ve given them all the excuses i could come up some true and others made up just to get them to drink it  of course their excuse was  water has no flavor  or  it doesn t taste good   so when mio first came on the market i thought that might be something to try  something to enhance the flavor and get them drinking  unfortunately when i m not around mio tends to become the  new juice mix   although i don t mind the enhancement of water to encourage kids to drink i d still prefer them to drink regular plain water when vine offered this product for review  the first thing that caught my eye was  vitamin   well why not give this a try  i was impressed  since this one required just one squeeze i emphasized that my 11yr old would be the one doing the squeeze and that s all they were going to get  well after their first squeeze the kids declared that it actually tasted good  not as great a mio but good enough my issues with this is that i would have much preferred to have them tell me 1tsp 1tbsp etc instead of a squeeze  not everyone squeeze the same  the other issue is that it does require refrigeration and because of its size it s not portable unlike mio which i can stick in my purse and take to the park i haven t checked out the other flavors but will stick with mio because of the ultra portability and the ability to get a vast assortment of flavors without having to buy a pack of 4 from amazon of this product  the kids love it but still prefer mio,1,0
1081,i had to write this because i was concerned about the smell others had been talking about  well to my nose there is no smell     at all  well maybe a bit of something but it is all good  my dog loves it  and finally honest kitchen made the ziplock bag enclosure  also  my cairn terrier has had skin problems forever  all his life and he is going on 14  since being on hc the last few months with another of their products he is not itching  so do not be afraid to try the product because of the perceived fish smell  i feel so much better about feeding him this product instead of even the best quality kibble  i did the raw thing for years and he had itching then and the coat looked bad  the smell of the fish,1,0
579,i bought these since i love the mon cherie and thought they would be similar they were not  to each his own  there is not allot if cherry and the chocolate quality poor in my opinion just a sort of mild cherry filling and not much the cherries are not whole but puverized there was also no expiration date to be found on the box and they were oldi believe the chocolate was turning whiter but i ate them  regardless  my seller was great  ottos hungarian deli and shipped them right out with my mon cheries which are excellent check the expiration dates ahead with your seller try the mon cheri if you are a fan of liquer and cherry  not my taste great seller only,1,0

591,this nature s path cereal tastes a lot like vanilla kashi cereals that i ve eaten  but is lighter   still  it remains impressively crunchy in milk and the texture is an interesting mix of big shapes and tiny spheres   overall  a nice earthy blend with light sweetness and a good amount of vanilla   it is very simple  but not bland i am surprised to see some reviewers say it is cloyingly sweet   to me  the sweetness was pretty subtle   more akin to health brands than lucky charms   for the record  i like both   in terms of vitamin content  yes  it looks worse by the numbers  but that is the result of it being a simple mix of organic ingredients rather than a synthetic assembly with supplements added to make us feel better about eating it why not 5 stars   while i like it  as a breakfast i do not think it would carry me far   this could be helped by eating a large bowl  but these small boxes would not last long that way   if you instead prefer a very light breakfast or want to eat this as a snack  i think it is a good option  crunchy vanilla,1,0

1053,these are a great deal for the price  normally we buy our syrups from starbucks because there is no place that sells these torani syrups  saw these and thought we would try them out  we have always used torani for our morning coffee so we knew we would like them  i m excited to try the new flavors the only problem is that they are stated as 150 ounces   i m not sure where that is coming from because the bottle clearly states 25 4 ounces  good price  oz is wrong,1,0
1024,i have tried every  good  cat food on the market   my babies only would eat the dorito s of the cat food market  f     f       usually chicken sometimes turkey sometimes beef  sometimes i would have to go thru all three flavors until they honored me with eating     i know  i am a mess   the two adult babies  6lbs and 17lbs  would eat 4 5 cans a day with dry also available   the poo was horrible smelling wally world was clearing this out one day so i bought a couple cans   omg they both scarfed it down   i went back to get the rest but it was gone   no longer were my babies interested in the bad food   this is shocking since i had tried everything after the pet food debacle a few years ago  even tried the frozen meat  and they wouldn t eat anything else   i only use one of the larger cans a day and their poo smell has drastically lessened i cant get this local so am thrilled to find it here with free shipping   i love amazon  anything i need i come here first and what is better than having your purchases delivered to your door   i cant say your cats will eat this but if they are not hyper picky they should    i tried turkey chicken and no go  has to be chicken rice  and you really do feed a lot less with this food  i am saving money and getting better food   yyyeeeeaaahhhh  the best,1,0

598,after using h s for many years i thought it was high time to try something else and see if i couldn t improve my current shampoo situation   clear men scalp therapy sounded interesting so i figured  what the heck     you get almost 11 ounces in this bottle which is a bit less than my current brand the bottle is easy to grasp and manage in the shower without becoming slippery from the water and opening is a breeze thanks to the push down lid   i found that while the consistency of this shampoo seemed a bit thin to me  very little was actually needed to achieve a full head of suds and to clean my overly oily hair and scalp after using clear men scalp therapy for 10 days i can happily report at least the same dandruff reducing results as i got my my mainstay head and shoulders  but since the shampoo is apparently more concentrated  i used less and it actually rinsed out faster the shampoo left my hair feeling totally clean with no trace of any sort of residue other than the scent which is not overblown   i am a bit surprised by other amazon reviews stating it leaves a bad residue and has a very heavy scent  i wonder if perhaps the quality and type of the water has something to do with all of this  we have very hard water here by the way  i can honestly say it rinsed clean for me and i didn t smell like i had fallen into a vat of perfume also  it was immediately apparent that rather than standing straight up and sticking out at odd angles  my hair seemed very relaxed and symmetrical before combing   i have no idea why  but it does for me anyway   if i can consistently find this brand at the same price i may seriously consider using it full time and retiring the old h s once and for all everyone has different tastes and while i really like this shampoo  others may not  as with everything  try one bottle and if you like it great  if not you are only out 6 bucks and can chalk it up to experience  as for me  i am pretty likely to purchase a few more bottle once this starts running out  helps me manage hard to tame hair,1,0
1028,i was so close to writing a favorable review  right down to the 2nd to last k cup from my 36 count pack   the flavor of the cyclone is a very rich smooth dark roast that i found most enjoyable   however  flavor gets trumped by inconvenience and unfortunately it is very inconvenient to clean your keurig after a k cup defecates its grinds all over it during the brewing process   my very last k cup was the hold out   i had read all the negative reviews that indicated the same problem and i was happy to not have had the same issue   but that was over on my last cup as the grinds spilt through the dispenser and filter system and of course into the cup of coffee   this is the fist brand of k cup that i have ever had do this   i enjoyed the coffee but i am disappointed in the design quality   i have read that the brooklyn company has corrected the issue in their more recent batches  mine was from a couple months ago  but i will wait to see a lot more positive reviews before purchasing again   edit   6 27 12brooklyn bean company commented below addressing my concerns   i sent them an email and they very promptly sent out a replacement box along with a smaller sample box of their different flavors   just based on the fact that they were willing to send me the replacement box made me adjust my review to 4 stars   the company is obviously taking the right steps to ensure a positive customer experience looking at the new batch i could not see any visible signs of improvement in the design  however i am over ten cups in and no incident yet   i have to mention again that the flavor is still very good and the sample pack was a perfect idea because if all the cups function properly i will definitely be purchasing a box of the  fuhgeddaboudit    i will finish this review with my final thoughts after all the cups have been used  almost there     ,1,0
597,i love salt and use a variety of salts to keep my blood pressure up in the normal range this salt  i think  may be the same as that sold by david wolfe s longevitywarehouse but you get twice as much for roughly the same price   not only are the descriptions similar  but comparing the salts side by side  they have the exact same color  flavor  texture  grind  fragrance  etc in my opinion himalayan salt is definitely much cleaner than sea salt ever since the fukushima plant began leaking radiation into the pacific ocean last year if not before   many people are unaware of this because the major television stations are not broadcasting information that would incriminate their owners but just google or youtube search if you want to know what is happening and what your government is not doing about it   i definitely recommend boycotting major media and getting your news from alternative sources like enenews which covers what university professors and doctors say is the real truth   if the sea salt wasn t harvested before fukushima started dumping nuclear waste  it is just too risky to ingest this salt is from the himalayas which may be just as far from fukushima s dumping ground as you can get  delicious nutritious non nuclear salt at a great price,1,0

1036,when i got my keeshond puppy about a year ago  i had trouble finding something that he would like to chew  that he was supposed to chew  until i discovered the wonderful world of  bully sticks    my vet advised against nylabone  which didn t interest him at all anyway  and rawhide for puppies  so i let my pup browse the pet store shelves and his nose lead him to the bully sticks  any nose from afar could smell these out    i handed one to him and it was love at first bite   they are quite expensive at the pet store  so i was thrilled to see them here on amazon for such a bargain  compared to pet store prices    with all the hype about pets getting sick from products made in china  i was also happy to see that these cadet bull sticks are made in brazil     though i know usa would be best  on average  i ve been buying 2 packages of these  large 1 lb  bull sticks  a month for about a year   at first  my puppy would take at least a whole day to consume one  and it was my sanity saver   any time i needed my pup to just chill out for a while  i d give him one of these long bully sticks and he wouldn t want to do anything else until it was finished   yes  they do smell   when you first open the package and if your dog is chewing it by your feet  you will definitely be surrounded by the fresh  pizzle  aroma   remember what these things are made of  though    it s what makes a bull  a bull      you also may not want your furry best friend to give you kisses while he s chewing it  but the smell does go away quickly and having my dog content and occupied is worth more to me than a brief  pizzle smell    because of their shape  they have not posed a choking hazard to my dog nor do they upset his tummy like many other things do now  if i had thought about writing a review on these large bull sticks months ago  i would have given this product 5 stars   i m rating it 4 stars now because the last couple of recent batches i ve gotten  have been very inconsistent in size     most of them pieces around 6   8  long instead of 12  long  however  they do package them to equal out to be 1 lb  worth of bull sticks  albeit some are short and very thin  some are very short and thick  some are long and thick    resisting inappropriate joke       my other disappointment with these latest batches is that the price has gone up about  5 from earlier in the year  but it s still a nice value compared to the pet stores   like someone else has mentioned  they also don t seem to grab the attention of my now 14 month old  45 lb  keeshond like they used to   the last 2 batches  he ll leave it lying around awhile  but will finish it in about an hour when he does feel like chewing it   i wonder if what they changed at the manufacturer   though it s still a must have for me in my arsenal of items to keep the dog busy  would have rated 5 stars a couple of months ago  but   ,1,0

595,i have to state up front that my dog is a very picky eater  so judging any kind of food with him is tricky   the first thing i noticed is that the bag i received was not resealable   the scissor cut line is below what looked like a zipper line  but the bag did not open until i cut below it   the food itself is very different looking and smells very nice  as far as dog food goes   my dog initially turned his nose up at it  but went back to eating virtually everything put in his bowl within a few hours   that s more than he will for almost every dry dog food i ve tried with him   most likely  i will try another bag of chef michael s grilled sirloin dog food in the future  a unique looking dog food,1,0

1049,i was drawn to this product because it contains zero amounts of sugar but the fiber count is just right too  the texture and taste are heartier than other shredded wheat products you may find down at your local wally world the only reason for not giving 5 stars is because the packaging does not fully seal the food from air  within the box  the biscuits are wrapped in thin paper packaging  6 biscuits in each of three packages  that is glued in spots along the seam  not glued continuously  and in between the spots of glue the paper is open and not fully sealed  the packaging really comes apart when you remove a couple of the biscuits for a serving  the glue is not strong  the packaging falls apart with handling and creates the need to store the remainder of biscuits from the opened package in your tupperware  maybe these shredded wheat biscuits need to breathe but i do not think so  i have complained about this on barbara s website and a company representative responded but as of yet  no action has been taken  best shredded wheat biscuit on the market,1,0
1048,attention  don t throw the treat away as others have  read below i first learned of this treat from a booth at the portland pet expo  and it has turned out to be an excellent  safe chew for our golden retriever puppy  when we first gave it to her  she absolutely loved it and chewed it for 15  minutes straight  which was quite an attention span for our then 11 week old puppy  the pet expo sold samples at a discount  but said the retail price for this size chew was   24  so i was glad to find it on amazon for so much less the himalayan chew is a combination of cow and goat cheeses  which is smoked for 7 months to produce a very hard chew which softens with puppy slobber  it does not stain  smell  or splinter  the only potential risk is a choking hazard as the chew gets small  what bone doesn t have this risk    however  we learned a trick at the pet expo that most people here don t know don t throw away the treat  when it gets so small you worry about choking  take it away and let it dry then microwave it for  10 15 seconds  the small chunck will get 3  times larger  and will be less dense as a result  now it is safe again to give to your pet as a quick treat  this way there is no waste  and your pet enjoys every last bit of it now that we have had two himalayan chews around the house for five weeks  our golden isn t quite as crazy about it as when we first got it  but she will still happily chew it over most of her toys and treats  and she hasn t finished either one yet  she still won t chew it for more than 15 20 minutes at a time  so it has time to dry out and harden again between chewing sessions  for larger dogs and more agressive chewers  i would expect that it wouldn t last nearly as long since it will stay softer as they keep chewing for longer times  great clean treat,1,0
1021,my cat is almost 10 years old now and i started thinking more about what i feed her   admittedly i should have paid more attention to this years ago but believe it or not  until recently  i just thought pet food was pet food   gizmo had a bladder infection a year or so ago and after learning that kidney disease is a common and deadly disease for cats  i wanted to see if switching foods would help her ward that off so she can live another happy 10 years or more   i did research and read all about how dry food and grains is unhealthy for cats and mainly filled with undigestible ingredients   grains in the food cause crystals to form in the urine as the cats body tries to process them   higher protein foods  grain free and with a higher moisture content are what is best   i read all the reviews here and decided to try this paw licking chicken flavor   for starters it doesn t have that gross smell most canned cat foods do   it seems close to human grade to me   from the first try of this gizmo was hooked   now she cries for it  rubs around me  sometimes even gets wild if i am ignoring her and jumps up onto the counter to get my attention that she wants to be fed   after buying 2 cases on here  i decided to try some regular store bought canned food   i just thought this may be a bit pricey to maintain and she was going through it like crazy   i tried several different brands from petco and several from the supermarket   i tried to get as close to this flavor as possible with shredded chicken flavors and none of that pate stuff   nothing   she will not eat a single other brand now   she cries and cries and if i set down something different she will sniff it and walk away   i tried being stubborn and said  well if you are hungry enough you will eat eventually   well she won because she actually started to lose weight   it was incredible   this 6lb cat won by starving herself   so i ordered more and she is eating and happy again   if it makes her happy and it s healthier than all the dried grain filled junk i fed her for years then i will continue to buy it cat goes crazy for this,1,0

1046,i was going to buy  then checked the ingredients at their website  natural fruit flavors is one of the ingredients  unfortunately  google  natural flavors msg    and wonder if the flavoring they add is high in free glutamic acid  maybe  maybe not  who knows  i won t buy smooze unless they remove this  i ll give a neutral 3 star rating and change if i hear back from the company here s the email i received  hi sorry for the delay to response because we are waiting answer from the maker they contain the natural fruit itself and traces of vanilla  carrot and cinnamon thanksjcsmoozeusaso i ll add a star  and order some  contains  natural fruit flavors   which means  updated,1,0
1680,the packaging it comes in won t last you unless you put it all in a zip lock freezer bag  i personally put it into plastic sandwich bags  times two   the brewed result is deeply orange and the flavor is somewhat weak  that s my usual tea to water ratio so perhaps i need to try again with a stronger mixture  i have had better loose tea from the chinese market but this is admittedly much easier to procure  so it s good quality  not terrible but not excellent  it s a good quality loose thai tea ,1,0
1627,honestly  i used to hate mineral water until i had this  i have tried every single mineral water known to man and this is  by far  the best  and cheapest       nothing compares,1,0
1682,i have been using this product for many years and i love it  every so often i try another brand  but i always come back to swheat  the odor control  my main issue with 4 cats  is outstanding  and the clumping is just fine  a friend of mine has multiple cats in a small apartment had a terrible odor problem  but would not take any of my advice  she was recently hospitalized and so i have been caring for her cats  i switched the litter to swheat  and guess what  odor problem solved overnight i have no idea what these bad reviews are all about  i would imagine if bugs are an issue in your area  they might be attracted to swheat  i live in a large city and do not have a bug issue  and have never seen bugs in or around the bag  i have never experienced any gooey mushiness  but i am guessing that if you do not use the litter properly this might happen  here s the thing  and this pretty much goes for any litter  you must fill the litter pan with several inches of litter  3 4 in  in order to gain maximum benefit  otherwise  how is it supposed to clump properly  or control odor  covering the bottom of the pan with 1 2 inch is not proper use of any litter i cannot imagine anyone  with proper use of this litter  not loving it  best litter ever  that s all there is to it  best litter ever,1,0
2222,i wasn t crazy about spending almost  35 on this snack but i m crazy for all snacks with the  flamin hot  label you can t cop them around the way though i can t front they arrived fresh and my whole crew is sweating me on where they can cop them the taste is worth the money yolo  expensive but it is what it is,1,0
2223,the senseo pods made by sarah lee have reportedly been discontinued and are almost impossible to find  melitta has introduced a new series of pods that are designed to be used in the senseo and fit perfectly the packaging and appearance of the pods are very similar to the former senseo pods  melitta has also produced a series of pods in the past which are too big for the senseo machines and do not fit without forcing  please be sure to order the melitta pods which are designed to be used in the senseo  the keurig machine completely dominates the market for single serve coffee makers and most coffee producers have discontinued making pods for the senseo  just when i thought i would have to junk my senseo machine  melitta introduced a new line of pods for the senseo  made for senseo,1,0

2227,so i fed my maltipoo with wellness core   she didn t really like it at first  but she ate it anyway   i felt sorry coz i already bought a huge bag of it     so my wellness core was finished and i was looking for other good food to feed her   and i found organix   coz of my stupidity  i ordered it late so i had to feed my dog junk food like kibbles   treat or smth like that   those grocery store food  yes   3 days of mcdonalds kind for her     so organix arrive and i immediately mix the food to prevent bad stomach  day 2  guess what lol  this is the first time i ever saw this happen  she left out all the junk kibbles and finish up all the organix  i guess   she knows which is better for her  i trust her    buying more next time     organix is the best ,1,0
2228,i typically like flavored coffees but had this in a sampler pack   this was pretty good and much better than the green mountain hazelnut decaf   it would have been better if i d had a flavored creamer with it  but i would buy this  not bad for a non flavored coffee,1,0
2229,the peppers are fine but  do not eat these  i can eat habaneros with almost no problem  but oh my god these made me crawl on the ground  really  i was scratching my tongue and drank a quart of milk  didn t help  haha  realy  don t eat them  then i scratched my nose and the oil was still on my fingers  you know where that went  ouch  ouch,1,0
2230,for a long time i thought i just didn t like coffee   turns out that i just don t like the stuff that my mom bought   i don t know what she used to buy for the old coffee maker  but now she likes the donut shop k cups   i can t stand that stuff without drowning it with vanilla creamer   it s just too bitter   the nantucket blend is a lot smoother   although the dark magic blend by green mountain is      interesting  of the coffees i ve sampled  i prefer the nantucket blend  i like these a lot,1,0
2231,i do enjoy this product but it is not as sweet as i would prefer   it does not have to be nutella sweet but i can almost feel saltiness which i don t like   the texture is also quite grainy   i have not tried the hazelnut product yet but i will before deciding if this is for me  not as sweet,1,0
2232,i bought these to give some to a vegan  ginger loving co worker  as a ginger lover myself  i was looking for something with strong ginger flavor  not too sweet  and with natural  limited ingrediants  after reading the reviews  these seemed to fit the bill and they did not disappoint   after i gave them to the one co worker  several others clammored for them  and with 5 lbs   there was more than enough to go around  though full flavored  i do not find them too strong  but that s a matter of personal preference   they do not stick to the wrapper  like other similar treats i ve had   i have not had them long enough  and may not   to know how long they will stay chewy and not harden  if they do   at under  30 including shipping  it s a great deal if you have ginger loving friends to share them with  ginger goodness,1,0
2233,excellent but not what i really wanted from this vendor  i wanted mango juice 100  made by the same company philippine juice nectar,1,0
2234,the bumblebees arrived on time  very carefully packaged  with none broken   they are larger than i expected  and very  very cute   i cannot attest to how they taste  but i bought them to decorate a cake  and they are small enough so that their flavor won t affect the overall taste   i m guessing they taste like hard sugar    perfect baking accent,1,0
125,i never tasted this   but my wife and step daughter loved it   it s not cheap   but who cares   i bought it for the holidays and it was a big hit   this may all be for naught   if there are no more sales of senseo pods in the us   that would seriously be lousy  must be good   for girls anyway,1,0
2236,while you can t blow rings of smoke from these  and they don t look quite as realistic  they taste much better than the bubble gum kind of cigarettes  and last much longer  definitely recommended for kids and adults of all ages  lots of fun edit  i purchased a box of these cigarettes from this seller  and while the candy is good  50  of them were broken in shipping  i bought these for mainly the appearance of the cigarettes  which doesn t work out too well when most of the candy sticks are snapped in half   in an attempt to fix this  i went through all 24 boxes of candy  dumped out the ones that were broken  and filled the boxes with as many whole cigarettes as would fit  about 25 in each box   which left me with about 6 boxes of 150 whole cigarettes  i still give this product four stars because there were still many whole cigarettes left  and while the fragments can t be used for show  they are still delicious and don t have to be thrown out  in the future i plan on buying this product at a candy store instead of online  to avoid the broken candy  better than the bubble gum kind,1,0
2237,i used this in a flower bed that i wanted to keep squirrels out of   it works well for that   i sprinkled it on the dirt among the flowers   it has an unpleasant odor but that wears off after a day or two   you do need to reapply it while the plants are still young after a rain or every week to 10 days   when the plants grow and fill in  you don t need to use it anymore because squirrels seem to leave the plants alone then    they like to see bare dirt    if you re using this for some other critter  i can t really speak to that  but it s great for keeping squirrels away  works for squirrels,1,0
124,i bought two types of traps  this  victor  and the  rescue fta sf4 reuseable fly trap with attractant  with the green screwtop  the victor one filled up with flies in just 3 days while the green lidded one had  lt 10 flies in it  the baits smell differently    so  i ve order the victor bait to put into the green trap to see if that works any better i ve been re using the traps and bait water by sieving out the flies  pouring the liquid back into the trap  and adding more water  four re uses later  it s still going strong note   this trap traps those big flies that look for stinky stuff   not the smaller flies that just fly in circles  amazing   smells w in 3  radius   downwind  but soooo effective,1,0

2239,i have seen the commercials for this shampoo  and i was excited to try it   i have not ever really had a problem with dandruff  but i was searching for a new shampoo  and thought i would try this one first of all  i really love the smell   it is almost a sweet smell  but not too strong   many other men s shampoos i find to have a strong and almost medicinal smell   i really like this one although i cannot comment so much on the dandruff side  it cleans and makes my hair and my scalp feel good   i would buy this product again  nice product ,1,0
2240,annie s ketchup is the only ketchup we purchase  first  it tastes awesome  second  it is gluten free and no animal products now  at my local health food store  they charge  5 49 a bottle  whole foods is even less expensive as of this review date  july 22nd 2012  pto mart  with fulfillment by amazon com  is charging  46 99 for a 6 pack of 24oz bottles   this comes to  7 83 a bottle  so  do not believe that shipping is free   it s included in their price and that s for sure there are others charging even more ridiculous prices plus shipping on top of that save yourself some money  actually  a lot of money and purchase it at your local whole foods or local health food store and don t let these ripoffs make a sucker out of you of course  if you have no other choice than amazon  well    then you have no choice  free shipping  don t believe it,1,0

2243,wasn t sure what these pears would be like  i eat pears with cottage cheese a lot  tried many brands of pears  too many are hard  almost too unripe  these pears are medium firm  not too hard and not too soft  could be used in any pear recipe  the light syrup is almost not syrup at all  not overly sweet and not thick  very thin so it doesn t ruin the taste of the pears  this is the second case i have purchased  i usually eat one jar a week and they have been consistently high quality  if you like pears  you will love these i m sure  better than canned pears,1,0
2244,product came on time  but the delivery didn t get to my address until late  i received a hot bag of goo  totally ruined what was to be a sweet n sour evening  as i wait for it to reach room temp and cool again  oh come on ,1,0
2245,had not tried this brand before but like the handy packs i can take with me when going out  stevia is a natural and not processed with a lot of chemical that are harmful to our bodies especially the liver  one i will not name uses formaldehyde yuck we know other uses for that stevia to me has no unpleasant after taste  it is just like using sugar  the fact this brand is organic is all the more reason to buy this brand  i make a lemon water that takes just a pinch and it is a great for that and the combo seem to be acting as an appetite suppressant for me  i know they are making no such claim just passing along something i personally have noticed if you use other non sugar sweeteners you should give this a try i do believe it is the best tasting and best for your body  enjoy  my choice for natural no calorie sweetener ,1,0
2246,i love skippy peanut butter  especially skippy creamy peanut butter  but the one thing i find so hard to believe is why amazon has to charge almost  10 just to buy 1 40 oz jar of skippy when you can get the same exact brand   size for under  9 bucks at the grocery and or retail store  but i guess amazon figures that they can get away with it if somebody wants the product bad enough and doesn t want to have to bother getting out and over to the store another thing that i have a hard time comprehending is why amazon sells skippy and jif in a 40 ounce size jar individually  but wont sell peter pan in a 40 oz jar individually and only let you buy the 40 oz jars and 28 oz jars in a multiple packet of 3 or more and will only sell peter pan individually in a 16 oz jar or 28 oz jar only  but apparently it may be due to skippy having a higher demand in more options and perhaps skippy and jif outsells peter pan overall  skippy was one of my favorite peanut butters growing up  especially in my childhood years when my mother was trying to watch how much sugar i ate in my diet since they say skippy only has 1 3 less sugar than most other peanut butters  skippy dipping ,1,0

121,i m eating my last pack as i write this and wanted to order more   it s lunchtime and two slices with butter and sliced cheese will be filling enough for me  i ve eaten it with lunchmeat  jam  honey  sliced eggs   mayo  plain greek yogurt on top  really  the sweetness of the bread goes well with the tart yogurt    fabulous amount of fiber  no sugar at all   personally  i think it s a waste to toast it  it doesn t even seem like the kind of bread you can toast  but that s only my opinion i feel the exact same way about their whole rye bread and usually alternate them if you have not eaten this kind of bread before  be aware that it is nothing like the usual stuff you buy here in the u s   not even the artisan bread   thin sliced  very dense  slightly sweet  i guess from the rye    full of flavor oh yes  i have had this pack for 18 months now   it supposedly expired in december of last year  6 months ago   but i somehow forgot about it and am just now opening it   tastes as good as it did a year ago   might not be a bad thing for long term emergency food storage  now that i think about it  yummy   this is real bread  not a squishy sugar filled slice of air,1,0

2189,i received caffe bomrad torino as a gift last christmas   when i opened the bag  the aroma of the beans made me want to try it immediately   i went to their website to learn more about the coffee and how best to brew it   my gift came with a new coffee grinder so i made it using my french press   i couldn t believe how good it tasted   it wasn t oily and it didn t leave a bitter after taste   after finishing my gift  i purchased my regular brand and couldn t believe how inferior it tasted  so i ordered some more   it may seem pricey at first  but kona coffee is a lot more and this is cheaper than buying a cup at the local coffee house  just opened my 4th purchase,1,0

2195,these are natural  healthy  freeze dried treats that are about the size of a half dollar and a half inch thick  they re a little too big to fit in a kong or the rubber mesh ball i put treats in for my dog so i give her these treats as a reward  the texture is just what you d expect from something that is freeze dried and they re quite crumbly so they will make a mess on the floor  fortunately  my dog is such a hog that she wolfs up every last crumb  obviously she loves the flavor but my dog isn t picky so i would be shocked if she didn t like these  i would buy these again although probably not very often due to the slightly high price which is  a little higher than what  i usually pay for treats  i most often get the mother nature biscuits made by natura  i gave these treats four stars due to the price and the size being too big  the ingredients are as follows  chicken  turkey  turkey liver  turkey heart  pumpkinseeds  apples  carrots  ground chicken bone  butternut squash  ground flaxseeds  montmorillonite clay  broccoli  lettuce  spinach  dried kelp  apple cider vinegar  parsley  honey  salmon oil  olive oil  mixed tocopherols with citric acid  a natural preservative   rosemary  blueberries  alfalfa sprouts  persimmons  inulin  sage  clove  my dogs loves them,1,0

2200,i was so disappointed with tidy cat scoopable litter that i was about to go back to the regular litter  but decided to give it one more go with a different brand  the trouble with tidy cat is that the soiled litter would turn to a thick  sticky mud that was very difficult to scoop and would leave a lot of mud like residue behind  i would end up emptying the entire litter box  clean it out  and start from scratch which defeated the purpose of scoopable litter fresh step proved to be a major improvement  it is so much easier to scoop and doesn t turn into the sticky mud that tidy cat would form  i can actually scoop now and not have to empty the entire litter box both fresh step and tidy cat controlled odor  tidy cat s plastic container was a bit easier to transport  fresh step prevents litter mess and waste  thus  saves money as pound for pound it scooped better and last longer  fresh step wins hands down as it is by far the most scoopable litter   i just disposed of two new containers of tidy cat as it wasn t worth the trouble and mess  fresh step vs tidy cat   fresh step wins hands down ,1,0

2203,it s ok  but not really different in flavor or aroma from the huge jugs of kikkoman soy sauce i buy at costco  it is quite savory  thankfully without sweetness  it is subtle on salt    but there is really not much to add to that  don t expect any exciting cherry oak smokiness undertones  it is quite ordinary  and not any different from the cheaper variety sold by the same company  which is why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5  it s ok,1,0
131,never tried rotel my entire life until now  what a waste  i d heard about it a lot  but always dismissed it as  ok  so it s some canned tomates that s popular in texas  whatever      oh well  at least now i know   it is great next time i ll have to order the hot version  although these were surprisingly spicy and the cilantro is what i really like about it no more salsas in glass jars  this is much tastier and less expensive only 4 stars b c bpa can lining  yuck  otherwise it would have been a solid 5  love it,1,0

2206,i take medications that really cause my scalp to be dry and itchy  especially in hot  dry weather  i tried the clear scalp   hair beauty conditioner and i liked the way my scalp and hair felt and looked afterwards  the downside was the fragrance   it was too strong for me  but i have respiratory issues that make me extremely sensitive to most fragrances  and have to be very careful with any product  preferring unscented if available  this fragrance is pleasant but not for me   i would definitely try the product again if it came out in an unscented or very light fruity citrus fragrance  not floral when i received the product it was tightly wrapped in plastic  but the bottle was leaking   the manufacturer needs to address that  perhaps with a safety seal under the cap both for leakage and consumer protection  really helped dry scalp ,1,0

127,overall  i am very happy with this drawer   it is nice and sturdy  and fits under the full size keurig machine with no signs of buckling  etc  from the weight of the machine   there is enough room left over on the top of the drawer for me to put the sugar canister beside the keurig i was really hoping to clear up some counter space with this  by having the k cups stored beneath the keurig  instead of in a rack beside it   in the end  however  i wasn t really able to save any counter space  because there is now a lot of wasted space behind the keurig drawer   in order to be able to open and close the keurig k cup compartment on the machine with it sitting on the drawer  i had to pull the drawer and keurig machine closer to the front edge of my counter  so that the k cup compartment opens in front of the overhead cabinets  because it was hitting the bottom of the cabinet and wouldn t open enough to get a k cup in there with the drawer pushed back against the wall   unfortunately  i have overhead cabinets over all my counters  so there is no way around this for me   if your keurig sits on an island counter  or other surface without a low hanging overhead cabinet  this probably wouldn t be a problem for you    but to be safe  i d measure how much clearance you have above your machine  with the k cup compartment open  and subtract about 3 5 inches from that space for the drawer  measure carefully ,1,0

2210,as a creature of habit  i have eaten two packs of quaker instant at work for the past seven years   after trying three different flavors of oat revolution  i will never go back   three reasons why 1  flavor   simply put  it tastes better than quaker   when i was buying quaker i had to cut the brown sugar with a packet of plain   i did not have to do it with this brand   it was not overly sweet  just delicious   i just took a look at their website and they have an absurd number of flavors  including a dark chocolate that i have not seen at the store 2   smart packaging   this likely only applies to me  but because i ate breakfast at my work  i never made the same bowl of oatmeal twice  sometimes  too much water  other times  too little   the oat revolution packet is the measuring cup   you fill the packet to the dotted line  and voila  perfect oatmeal every time 3  nod to the planet   they are conscious about environmentally sensitive packaging  instant classic  pun intended ,1,0
2211,just ate my first batch and it s as good as any white popcorn i have had  i encountered difficulty obtaining white popcorn from grocery stores and was reduced to eating the horrible yellow type  luckily i decided to shop this site  and i could not be more pleased  you will not be disappointed next time i will order two four pound jars plus the snappy popcorn white cheddar shaker  and get free shipping for a purchase over  25   which is important because the shipping charges are significant  great white popcorn      ,1,0
2212,the ingredients are fresh and wholesome   however  the taste is in my opinion  bland   it is effective but you must be consistent in its use   use it daily and be patient   after several weeks   you will notice that you are feeling much better   i have to brew it with another flavor of the yogi tea because i do not like the taste   it does not taste nasty  just very bland   the results are worth it  excellent quality ingredients,1,0

2216,i had a minor mole problem in the front of my yard  i live in a sub development with kids and pets so not wanting to use toxic chemicals or lethal force unless absolutely necessary i gave this a try  i applied a heavy soaking to a 6  perimeter around my property and we have had no activity since  before using this stuff i was seeing new mole hills every few days  it was very easy to apply with the hose and made no mess  i expected an odor but it wasn t noticeable and was completely gone in 10 mins  i have no idea where the mole s  went but i haven t seen them on my property  this would certainly be my first attempt to remove a future infestation   my experience was with moles only  i don t know how gophers respond to this stuff  worked for me,1,0
2217,ok  i m a diehard p19 fan  way to go amazon for keeping this product alive   my question is  what the heck is the matter with kellogg s  put some advertising dollars into p19  according to wikipedia  the product has been around since 1967  but the vast majority of americans have never heard of it   get a clue kellogg s  wake up kellogg s ,1,0

118,local store s discontinued sale   3 50 usd i bought a jar upon eating some i was stunned at what was happening to my mouth  eager to replicate the impossible  i took another spoonful the next day i bought the rest of the jars  there are no more jars  after the last i slept for 20 hours i m scared  if i order more  part of me will be satiated  but at a terrible cost to my faculties  the agonizing wait makes purchasing a zero sum game apricots taste like ash now  demand your local grocer carry this product,1,0

2255,i m sitting here sipping my milk after trying this sauce for the first time and i will tell you that this sauce is very  very hot   it s definitely hotter than any other sauce that i ve bought at a store and the heat lingers for a while after being consumed   the shipping was very decent also  ordered on thursday  received on monday from seller acss    the taste  however  has left me with something to be desired   it just tastes like any other hot pepper   i was hoping it would have some other spices in there to really get the flavor going  but it doesn t   bummer  extremely hot,1,0
2282,i eat this jam occasionally with peanut butter on crackers  and it is quite tasty  while it is less unhealthy than other sugary jams  i don t deceive myself that it won t raise blood sugar  because it is essentially 100  fructose  which is just as capable of raising blood sugar as sucrose  white table sugar   more on this below most people buy this product as a presumed health food due to it being lower in sugar than other jams  it s ingredients are   juice concentrate  pear  grape   strawberries  maltodextrin  dietary fiber   fruit pectin  citric acid  natural flavor   this product contains no artificial sweeteners  which are associated with various health hazards this product s primary claim to fame is that it is  as the label states   sweetened only with fruit juice   any jam will have its sweetener listed first  meaning that is its primary ingredient  if you are on a low carb diet or diabetic  you might want to know that this jam basically substitutes fructose for sucrose  since fructose is twice as sweet as sucrose  the producers only need to use half as much as they would have of sucrose  so it has about half the calories of regular jam   on the other hand  many cheap jams contain high fructose corn syrup  but that s another health issue entirely   the problem for many people is that they are used to the taste of sucrose  and 100  fructose tastes very different from a combination of fructose and sucrose which is the case with regular jam made with white sugar  to my own taste  since i m eating a fruit spread  it tastes quite sweet enough to me the fruit pectin in this product is a standard thickener in jellies and jams and its own natural form of fiber  so i am not sure why the company decided to add in maltodextrin and call that  fiber  too  anyone with a gluten intolerance should be wary of this product because of the maltodextrin since some people with gluten intolerance are getting sick from the maltodextrin in this jam  the producers claim on the label it is  gluten free   but maltodextrin can be made from either wheat or corn  and apparently this company is not being careful enough about contamination with gluten another ingredient that is problematic as to how healthy this product can be is the  natural flavor   it is possible that the producers add a strawberry extract so they can get away with using less real strawberries  which are more expensive than a flavoring  the definition of natural flavor under the code of federal regulations is   the essential oil  oleoresin  essence or extractive  protein hydrolysate  distillate  or any product of roasting  heating or enzymolysis  which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice  fruit or fruit juice  vegetable or vegetable juice  edible yeast  herb  bark  bud  root  leaf or similar plant material  meat  seafood  poultry  eggs  dairy products  or fermentation products thereof  whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional   21cfr101 22   that essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food  but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is  delicious taste  but you pay a premium to substitute fructose for sucrose,1,0
2285,have you ever had a popcorn snack and thought   was this popped a few years ago  the popcorn is stale and tough   well  that s something that does not happen with poppycock  likewise  i ve eaten popcorn with a glaze that is so thin you can t taste it  that s also something that never happens with poppycock poppycock is so much better than other popcorn snacks that they shouldn t even be in the same category  poppycock also doesn t use peanuts  instead it has almonds  pecans  or cashews  to say it s the premium popcorn snack would be to damn with faint praise ok  it s more expensive than it s  competitors  but then nothing else is competitive with poppycock  if you are worth a premium snack  the poppycock is the one you want  my favorite snack,1,0

2288,we began feeding royal canin giant breed adult to our first two german shepherds in 1990  from 2 5 mos   we tried every top brand on them   iams  hills science diet  store brand and vet line   canidae  eukanuba  etc  some they wouldn t even touch and the ones they tried would come out one end or the other in no time at all  the pups were weak and sickly  exhausted from their daily surprises  i found this food   their coats started shining  lots more energy  clear bright eyes  and no stomach or health issues since  great for german shepherds  health   sensitive stomachs ,1,0
2289,i was a bit hesitant to order so many of these bars at one time until i remembered that i got them from amazon   i can return them if the family didn t like them   well  i did not get a chance to return them   not only did my husband   who  by the way  does not like coconut   like them  my son favors them over all the other kashi bars   i will be putting these in my shopping cart again  the best tasting granola bars ,1,0
2290,this is just my opinion  but i think this coconut oil smells terrible  i have to turn my head in the opposite direction wen using it because i hate it that much  however  that s just my thought on it and i realize other people love the smell so you ll have to try it to see what you think i use this in the shower as my last step before getting out  it melts right in your hand when you use it and absorbs in your skin fairly quick  i don t have to put additional lotion on after the shower  which isawesome also i recently got a pretty bad sunburn and have been using the oil on it  it works much better than aloe and it took away the painful sting you just can t beat this product for the size and the cost  smells terrible  but works great for skin,1,0
94,finally   i found a product i like   vitamin squeeze energy drink  i have tried many  many different water enhancers like crystal light        mio       lipton     but vitamin squeeze has 0 calories  sugar and carbs  120  vitamin c  40  of vitamins b3 b5 b6 b12  10  zinc  40 mg caffeine  10 taurine and electrolytes i really don t care for artificial sweetners   they leave a horrid aftertaste with me and i stay away from them   vitamin squeeze is sweetened with sucralose   i have reviewed other products with sucralose and have not cared for them at all there is something different  in the mix  with vitamin squeeze that i prefer over the above mentioned products and i can tell you that i will be trying and buying the different varieties of vitamin squeeze  finally   i found a product i like   vitamin squeeze energy drink   ,1,0
2292,brought pantry moths home in a bag of cat food   the trap seemed to catch many of them  and eventually  after a few rounds of purchasing traps  i stopped seeing evidence of moths in my kitchen a word of caution  if you live in an apartment or have neighbors who live very close  make sure that the moths are coming from your home and not in the windows   after my own infestation was cleared up  i noticed that moths were coming in through the windows to get to the lures   as soon as your home is moth free  get rid of the traps or you might end up with a new problem  got the job done,1,0

2296,i ve used this product intermittently over the past decade at least   i don t bake much but when i do need it  it has worked perfectly every time   i made cornbread with it last night and i had to use a container that was pretty outdated   it was mostly dried out and hard lumps   i figured i had nothing to lose so tried it and it worked great   i think i have gotten mine at the grocery store each time before and have had no problem   i am going to place an order online now i hope this product stays around and that the company doesn t change the formula  by  improving  it in the wrong direction    awesome product ,1,0
2297,not a bad sample mix  i wish there were at least two of each flavor though so my husband and i dont have to fight over who tries what   there were a couple of flavors that only had one  all of the others had at least three  overall pretty good variety  descent flavor mixture ,1,0
2299,i like my coffee in the mild range   and this fits the bill   i had been drinking nothing but green mountain breakfast blend  and while i would say i prefer that variety a little better in terms of taste  these tully s are very similar   and given the ridiculous price of most k cups   green mountain included   i will stick with the tully s for now   the only thing i didn t really like is that the 50 k cups were thrown in to the shipping box loosely  with no additional packing material   even something like a plastic bag to seal them up inside the shipping box would have been nice  nice   mild blend,1,0
2300,the item shipped as individual boxes of 4  sticks rather than the long sticks item was very fresh  but i prefer the original flavor rather than the mild i couldn t pass up on the warehouse clearance price  if this item comes back in stock  i will purchase again for the incredible cheap price  warehouse deal comes and goes ,1,0
98,whenever i try a  healthfood  product i assume that the health claims are for the most part true   at least i assume that the snack is going to be better for me than a candy bar  unfortunately alot of nutrition bars taste like cardboard and drive me back into chocolate purgatory  in this particular taste  i found this kashi product tasty  crunchy  chewy  and filling  it passed my test   and i did not feel like sneaking a piece of chocolate to supplement my snack  when i went back to try another bar later  i found that the gremlins  my children  had discovered my stash  when this happens sometimes i find half eaten bars lying in the folds of the recliner   not this time  the bars were consumed totally  wghich tells me that these snacks passed the kid test  they re not interested in health   they go for taste  congratulations kashi  another winner  passes the kid test,1,0
2301,this is the second clear scalp conditioner i have tried  the first one was for color treated and or damaged hair   i have long fine hair   i found this to be a great conditioner   it leaves your hair very soft   i often have a problem with tangles after using many other conditioners  but with this conditioner  my hair has almost no tangles   however  i did not find that it left my hair with greater volume than normal   it does not weigh my hair down at all  but i didn t notice the volume boost as advertised   overall though  i really like this conditioner   i think it is better than many salon conditioners i have tried  so i definitely recommend it   just don t expect it to work miracles on the volume of your hair  leaves hair soft with no tangles,1,0
2302,my vet ordered new cat food with high protein and low crude fat  specially for senior cats and cats with blood in their stool  i ordered this item and was surprised about the high fat content which is not specified on amazon sites but my cats like it and never leave rests on their plates   my next order will be the classic pate whitefish and tuna for my kids  this product contains 11  protein but only 4  of crude fat  which comes close to the purinaone canned foods which are more expensive protein ok  crude fat too high,1,0
2303,my  3  bag order   45 00 worth   i must be crazy  of these delicious dill pickle potato chipsshowed up with only one bag not crushed  one of the other two was opened like it had been popped had to throw that one away and the last one was open just enough to start making the chips stale  so i loved the chips but hated the shipping of a fragile as eggs food product  guess i ll wait for them to come to the local store    loved the chip   hated the ship,1,0
2304,mints are great  of course  but i thought i would use this review space to fill you in on the details not included in the product listing   the tin itself is approximately 4 5  tall and 4  in diameter   there is a nutrition information sticker nearly covering the lid but it is easily removed without leaving any sticky residue   the mints inside are all loose in one plastic bag so not individually wrapped if that is what you are looking for  i would prefer even if it would mean less fit in    this also means that you lose some of the detail imprinted on the mints since they are all banging up against each other  they aren t quite as pretty as they could be    hope that helps if you are considering as it is all information i would have appreciated prior to ordering  see here for specs,1,0
2305,although i read lots of reviews and many said trapping those little pesky moles was the only way to get rid of them from your lawn  i was not totally convinced   ordered two of these traps and within 24 hours i had my first little varmint   second one shortly after   hitting a main run is a key  but darned if this trap doesn t do exactly what is says   it works      it works,1,0

90,i ve had 2 senseo machines   i thoroughly enjoy the coffee pods and was so sorry recently to be told by amazon that they are no longer available as a subscribe   save product through them  after all these years  6  at least  of drinking senseo coffee   and it s getting impossible to find at any of my local grocery stores   i had come to completely rely on amazon as the one place where i could always find senseo coffee pods  i realize this is likely not amazon s choice  it may be as sad for amazon as it is for me  i have to echo the sentiment i read in another s comment on the site    what do i do with my senseo coffee maker now  plant flowers in it   so sad tht it s no longer available as a subscribe   save ,1,0
2308,of the 35 k cups  none of the dates that i saw were expired  all were at least 3 months out in the future  there were   28 caffeinated coffees  1 decaf  3 teas  1 apple cider  2 hot chocolatesthere was a good selection of brands  i was slightly bummed to get 5 that were grove square  as to me that s lower end quality  overall there were only a couple exotic flavors  so most of them were just various roasts   don t buy it if it s a gift  at least not if you want nice packaging  if you want it for yourself  the brown bag didn t bother me and not a single cup was dented or open  don t buy it if you have your heart set on certain brands or flavors  you won t necessarily get what s advertised here or in your ideal amount  but if you re flexible and just want to try some different flavors without buying boxes of each  this fits the bill  satisfied with the selection,1,0
2309,i like these bars  they contain some nuts  lightly coated in dark chocolate  they are a bit harder than many other bars to bite into because of the whole nuts used  this is not like a quaker chewy bar by any means  the ingredient list is relatively short  so it s easy to comprehend what s actually in these things  and the low sugar content makes them seem almost healthy the one point i have against them is their price   1 67 for a relatively small  40 gram  bar  purchased in bulk seems like a bit too much  that s a rate of neariy  20 pound  i would probably not purchase them at that price  bring it down to about  1 00 each and i might consider it  taste fine  somewhat pricey,1,0

88,i m currently stationed in afghanistan and missed cooking so i ordered this product  i just got done making it    it calls for an egg  oil  and milk  i had no measuring cups so i guesstimated the oil and milk  i forgot the egg completely   i don t have real eggs but i ordered powdered eggs   i mixed it up in a ziplock baggie since i dont have a mixing bowl  cooked it on a camping burner  and flipped it with plastic forks  it was lumpy and messy but let me tell you  they tasted great  i am not sorry i purchased this    now i just need a spatula  measuring cups  and a mixing bowl  even i can t screw it up ,1,0
87,pros   no sugar added  it doesn t taste that sweet  but it is sweet  easy to open packagingcon  the green cap seems way too big  i like products that have minimal packaging  although a big green opening does make it easy to open the package  unless you have bad motor skills  you don t need it to be that big conclusion  a good  healthy product with no artificial ingredients  organic and easy to use,1,0
2313,if you like coconut water  this is for you  i had bought this product at a local market to try  while having chemo  turns out the more i drank  the more i wanted  it has potassium in it  and some chemo makes you potassium deficient  so  i felt better drinking this product along with lots of water  to say hydrated  vita coco 100  pure coconut water,1,0
2314,i had been making roasted potatos with lipton onion dip mix and was concerned since the sodium levels were so high  i tried this product since it was low in sodium 4 of these packs equal sodium of 1 lipton pack   i had to use 2 packs of this product to get same taste but it was still a healthier verison   i would buy again better than lipton dip mix,1,0
2315,i eat this jam occasionally with peanut butter on crackers  and it is quite delicious  i love cherry preserves  and these are a very good choice for that while this brand is less unhealthy than other sugary jams  i don t deceive myself that it won t raise blood sugar  because it is essentially 100  fructose  which is just as capable of raising blood sugar as sucrose  white table sugar   more on this below most people buy this product as a presumed health food due to it being lower in sugar than other jams  it s ingredients are   juice concentrate  pear  grape   cherries  maltodextrin  dietary fiber   fruit pectin  citric acid  natural flavor   this product contains no artificial sweeteners  which are associated with various health hazards this product s primary claim to fame is that it is  as the label states   sweetened only with fruit juice   any jam will have its sweetener listed first  meaning that is its primary ingredient  if you are on a low carb diet or diabetic  you might want to know that this jam basically substitutes fructose for sucrose  since fructose is twice as sweet as sucrose  the producers only need to use half as much as they would have of sucrose  so it has about half the calories of regular jam   on the other hand  many cheap jams contain high fructose corn syrup  but that s another health issue entirely   the problem for many people is that they are used to the taste of sucrose  and 100  fructose tastes very different from a combination of fructose and sucrose which is the case with regular jam made with white sugar  to my own taste  since i m seeing this as a fruit spread as much as a jam  it tastes quite sweet enough to me the fruit pectin in this product is a standard thickener in jellies and jams and its own natural form of fiber  so i am not sure why the company decided to add in maltodextrin and call that  fiber  too  anyone with a gluten intolerance should be wary of this product because of the maltodextrin since some people with gluten intolerance are getting sick from the maltodextrin in this jam  the producers claim on the label it is  gluten free   but maltodextrin can be made from either wheat or corn  and apparently this company is not being careful enough about contamination with gluten another ingredient that is problematic as to how healthy this product can be is the  natural flavor   it is possible that the producers add a cherry extract so they can get away with using less real cherries  which are more expensive than a flavoring  the definition of natural flavor under the code of federal regulations is   the essential oil  oleoresin  essence or extractive  protein hydrolysate  distillate  or any product of roasting  heating or enzymolysis  which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice  fruit or fruit juice  vegetable or vegetable juice  edible yeast  herb  bark  bud  root  leaf or similar plant material  meat  seafood  poultry  eggs  dairy products  or fermentation products thereof  whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional   21cfr101 22   that essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food  but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is  delicious taste  but you pay a premium to substitute fructose for sucrose,1,0
91,ingredients   coconut juice  sugar  polysorbate 60  salt  citric acid  mono and diglycerides  propylene glycol  alginate  sorbitan monosterate  sugar gum and locust bean gum i had not known what the ingredients in this were and that was foolish of me   i was looking only for creamed coconut with nothing else added   the white creamed meat    however  this is a very thick  very sugary sweet syrup   you have to pay attention to taste coconut   so  i ll only be able to use about 1 2 a teaspoon a day and have enough now to last an entire lifetime though i d wanted the  butter  or  paste  and was upset at first  i discovered that this tastes great on cream of wheat or even oatmeal  just a teaspoon at a time   really spiffs up the taste and flavor  i did order kevala coconut butter 16oz after receiving this too  this was delivered very fast   the next day  goya cream of coconut  but not coconut creamed butter ,1,0
138,these sweet potatoe chips were tasty with my only real objection being maltodextrin which is hardly the  all natural nothing fake of phony  as advertized   yes it is derived from wheat or corn but this highly processed food flavoring is hardly what most would consider when we hear  all natural no fake flavors    of course they are technically telling the truth it is just a natural sourced  highly processed  sweetner from starch and a source of carbs so aside from the weasel words in the label the product is fine  i just wish they wouldn t try and pretend to be something they are not   they are  snack food   we expect some downside tasty generous servings but not what i think of when they say all natural,1,0
2280,i bought this to use with my nespresso essenza machine and capsules   nespresso capsules are quite a bit smaller and ended up falling out the sides  i was prepared for this scenario and took a chance   my son came up with a great idea for the capsules   we keep them in the sleeves they come in  which fit perfectly   i love that my nespresso can sit on top of it and the capsules are right there   the only bad thing is that my machine vibrates a bit but it is missing a rubber foot or two  after  i take care of that  i expect it to be perfect   so   in the end  this isn t just for the keurig  i put up a picture with my nespresso machine and capsules  check it out to see if it will work for you    works for nepresso capsules if kept in the sleeve  ,1,0

112,so i pre ordered these and had them arrive on march 5th  i did not immediately open them as i had to finish up my other batch of pod style k cups while the coffee was on par with the coffee people s donut shop or dunkin s  there was one problem i had more with these cups more than any other they would explode it seemed to be a roll of the dice as to what would happen  it would either spit out grounds into the coffee cup or gush out the sides at the top  in either case  it always seemed to be the foil top had come  unglued  from the cup itself it got to the point where i will stand at my machine and stop the process if it gushed out the side  cleaning up the mess afterwards was a pain i don t know if i had got a bad batch since it was a new product or just the quality control of the company  but until i feel the cost outweighs the cleanup  i will hold off buying anymore from this company    edit 06 01 12   as promised  they sent me a new box of coffee  after having used 10 pods  i can say it is much better than before  i only had one that ended up with grounds in my cup  but none that exploded as previously stated  so because of the efforts by the customer service to owning up to the issue and sending me a box of the updated pods  i am updating my rating to a 4 from a 3 thank you  pretty decent coffee  if it doesn t explode     edited ,1,0

110,i was not sure what to expect  given the mixed reviews  i decided to try the brooklyn bridge blend because i do like green mountain nantucket blend  i am about half way through the box with no no brewing failures in my 2006 b50 keurig brewer  it is not quite the same flavor as the nantucket blend  in my opinion   but it is not bad at all  it is a bit stronger  and has a bit of an aftertaste that i associate with stronger roast  like french roast   i will probably try their colombian next   but would buy this one again at some point  still searching for a good replacement for columbian la verde though    happy with purchase,1,0

107,i bought this product out of curiosity  a small recipe book came with it  since i had no idea how to use this mix  i used a recipe from the book which was chicken and sauerkraut goulash  it tasted so good   i pretty mush use the mix for only this recipe since then   it may not taste like typical goulash with this product  but i really love this  love this taste,1,0

2279,this product will eliminate your mole problem   if you place it on a path frequented by the varmits  it will kill them   i had tried everything from sprays to poisons to grub control  and nothing worked  purchased this trap and the sucker was dead 2 days later   thanks for a real way to get rid of moles  scum of the earth critters      don t waste time with other products or methods,1,0
105,years ago philips and douwe egberts were partners in the development of the machine and coffee pods   the copyright on the pod system was ruled invalid and a decision was made to offer the pods via on line vendors only  no more brick and mortar stores   philips then sold their share of the coffee business to douwe egberts and are moving pod production to brazil   this is causing the delay  especially with the dark roast   according to senseo the coffee should be by june or july at the latest   or so they say   i am surprised that they have not made this info more available   seems like many will simply move on to another coffee machine   meanwhile try using a regular coffee filter and espresso grind your own coffee   i ve tried starbucks coffee and not bad   less creama  but good flavor   google  make your own coffee pods  to see the methods used to trim the filter and pack the coffee   it s easy  but not so easy as dropping two pods and pushing the start button  can t find senseo coffee  here s the story,1,0
103,when i got this juicy pear and garden greens baby food for my daughter i wasn t sure if she would go for a pear spinach broccoli   the puree is mostly pears with flecks of spinach and broccoli in it   i m not a fan of the smell of this food  but my daughter can t get enough of it   she really likes it and gets quite upset if i don t feed it to her quickly enough   i was ver concerned that it wasn t going to be palatable  but her eagerness to eat this makes me think it must be pretty tasty the pouch is convenient if you are only going to serve a portion of this to your baby   simply squeeze out what you re going to use and then cap it and pop it in the fridge  baby really likes this unconventional combo,1,0
2267,i cannot attest to the results purported yet by this product but my cats love them  our younger male cat  3 years  especially loves them and will gnaw on a whole one of these  treats   he even got into the bag when we were gone and ate 5  the other cats did not seem interested because they are ridiculously large almost 2  x 0 5   the are wrapped in a wafer paper like material with a flaky  wafery  crumbly  stuff inside  to feed the other cats  i applied pressure to the wafer and rolled it back and forth between my fingers to break it out of the  shell   i do this and add it to their food or put it separately on their plate like an side dish in addition to their wet meal and they love it  go nuts for it  i associate it with like brushing our teeth after we eat  they eat their main course  have dried bonito flakes on the side  and then have a side of these flaky chews  not really chews at all  like a crepe rolled up tight   i have only recently made this purchased and started using this product so cannot provide evidence for  or against  the claims of the product regarding pet hygiene and dental health but will post an update later in time  is it weird i kinda like the smell of them     enzyme oral hygiene chews,1,0
2268,i had no idea something could taste this good  i m not really a caramel person  but if i had dreamed up the most perfect balance between sweet salty buttery richness it would be these caramel sea salt squares  i found them at whole foods and they are expensive  but worth every penny  milk is the perfect compliment  get some and you will not be disappointed  you may be ruined for chocolate brownies  the brownie of my dreams and it s not chocolate ,1,0
2269,the mango flavor is good but not necessarily five pounds worth of eating  the 12 flavor variety bag or even the orange only bag are better options than this unless you love the flavor  i disagree with the others saying that these are terrible but the fact is that they re not on the same level as some of the other flavors  solid taste but not as good as the other flavors,1,0

2272,i placed an order for three community coffee private reserve ground coffee  medium dark roast  100  chicory  12 ounce bags  pack of 6   thinking it was coffee  when i first looked at the product description it said 100  coffee  but it s 100  chicory and i called amazon to clarify their description  i like the taste of chicory blended into my coffee  i use half a table spoon for every three spoons of coffee  it has a unique but pleasant flavor  but you can t drink it straight  i am not blaming amazon and giving it five stars because it is what it is  chicory that is a good buy and helps flavor my coffee  if your a chicory fan then this review is useless  but if you are like myself  remember this is not coffee i hope you find my review helpful  chicory is not coffee  please read ,1,0
2273,these are great  i ordered these for a nautical themed bridal shower to give away as favors  they look like they shouldn t be edible  just like stones  but they taste great  exactly like m ms to be exact  and who doesn t like m m s  there were some that were broken in the bottom  the seller shipped in a bag and i think if these were shipped in a box there would be less broken     but there are 3 pounds of them  so the broken ones are essentially negligible  the centers were slightly melted  but it was hot out and this did not destroy the integrity of the product  some time inside room temperature or a refrigerator would solve this problem anyway  i would recommend these  taste like m m s,1,0
101,i dont know what all the bad reviews are about  this is practically the only all veggie organic baby food option i could find  99  have a sweet fruit mixed in to mask the vegetable flavor so baby will eat it  if you prefer that thats your choice but for any foodies out there you ll appreciate the mild hint of mint in this combo  no its not  overwhelming  as some state imo its just a hint and its mint  not a chemically added flavor so whats the problem   its an all organic all veggie option for those interested  great organic all veggie option ,1,0
2274,i purchased this 20lb order of pasta to share with my family because we cannot seem to find these in the stores around us any more  sadly  the imported pasta commonly has weevils which i know you cannot avoid i understood that this product could not be returned but it was a real shame paying  30 for this and only getting a few bags out of it because the rest had those bugs a credit of some kind would be greatly appreciated     thanks weevils,1,0
2275,my canine companion is a 132 pound  five year old  shiloh shepherd   the shiloh shepherd is considered a  giant breed    with his enormous size  athleticism  and the general nutrient demands  we all must consider  his diet has always been a primary consideration   not to mention  he has the sensitive tummy often seen among the german shepherd breed   his breeder has always been partial to  premium edge lamb    this is the formula he was weaned on   i had no desire to change what appeared to be a successful regimen then to my dismay  i learned  premium edge  was placed on a recent recall list   i knew that a change in diet was likely to be detrimental to my fur friend  but i had to take immediate action   and  at the time of recall  i didn t have time to gradually transition to a new diet  which is always the way to go  to avoid negative symptoms after carefully analyzing formulas of numerous dry kibble  i opted to give pinnacle  trout   sweet potato  a try  ordering a 15 pound  starter  bag from amazon   in addition  i ordered some digestive enzymes to assist in the transition phase the bag arrived   i opened it with my dog assisting to see what his response would be   the first whiff out of the bag was strong  smelling of fish   i noted the kibble size  itself  was quite small for a large breed dog  but felt this was only a minor reservation   the ultimate test was not what i thought about it  but what my shiloh would   he immediately had a positive response   in fact     he loves it   he appears more enthusiastic about it than the  premium edge  i had to start the pinnacle before the enzymes arrived  so i was expecting some terrible gas and possibly some diarrhea   well  that was not the case   he has gone through the 15 pound bag  and half of the next order     a 30 pound bag  with no diarrhea  or gas  at all   in fact  his stools appear firmer and more consistent than on his previous diet   supplementing with the enzymes was actually not necessary i m delighted with this new regimen   i also love that i can order a 30 pound bag through amazon and have it delivered to my front door   i m now avoiding a considerable drive   and   the back breaking discomfort  of lugging around heavy bags of kibble my dog is happy  and i m happy   that said  after an adequate therapeutic trial  i feel confident in recommending pinnacle  my shiloh loves it ,1,0
100,this is a great value you what you will find elsewhere   yes the packaging is terrible but it is a box within another box   the inside box is poor and there will be sugar spilling into the outer box but not in large amounts   after just taking the inner box out  leaving the spilled sugar crystals in the outer box it was still over 5 lbs so who cares how its packaged   with that said if you are hoping this sugar will have a different or deeper flavor than normal sugar it won t   there is more  raw  sugar or even sugar with more molasses but this is just colored sugar   the description is not misleading but it may not be a direct comparison to some of the alternatives   the crystal size was pretty large any larger it would take forever to dissolve in your drink  if you care about that   great value but it is just coloring,1,0

99,who can account for a cat s taste   my cat love seafood pate  and hates any of the various filets in other cat foods   she also hates beef  chicken she will tolerate all these people complaining about busted cans    i have never had any problem with the quality of the cans or leaking cans the other complain is that sometimes amazon jacks up the price when their inventory is low   this has nothing to do with the cat food      that is amazon s pricing policy   if you think the cost is too high  don t buy it my supermarket sells this for 60 cents plus sales tax   amazon is 50 cents  no sales tax plus the convenience of free delivery i would give this 5 stars  but i am not sure if my cat will like all of the 4 different varieties   cats seem to like very smelly fish food   my cat likes this stuff follow up   my cat doesn t like anything with salmon  so i won t be buying this pack again  my cat loves seafood pate,1,0
2277,i bought this to throw to the kids from my classic car in a 4th of july parade  not only was itgood tasting  but it stayed good through the  over 100 degree heat  even 2 weeks after the 4th  i wasstill eating some i had left over and it was fine  i hope its available next year  good parade candy,1,0
104,i have used this product for years  it has lots of flavor and resembles and feels like real honey  the down side of this product is the gas  problem  when you eat excess       amounts of it  i use it in place of karo syrup to make almond crusted pecan pies  it produces an  okay  pie  however  i eat large slices of this pecan pie and that causes the gas  problem   i bought bottles of nature s hollow and natrazyle kosher substitutes for side by side comparison with honey tree  although neither caused a gas  problem   i believe both are lacking in flavor and the natrazyle appeared to have a slimy  mouth feel   i will try each of these in a pecan pie and if i believe either of the pies is better than the honey tree pie  i will report back  strong on flavor and gas,1,0
2316,agree with previous review  not much of a oatmeal cookie   cannot really taste or see much oatmeal  however  a really good tasting chocolate chip cookie  so not all bad  gave 4 stars because took a long time to receive  was concern about the heat with oatmeal and the chocolate chips  if wants a good tasting chocolate chip cookie with a little taste of oatmeal  this is your cookie  not bad   okay,1,0
2182,love this product   how can these be 1 pt on weight watchers for 3 4 cookies   my plain shortbread list the following ingredients  wheat flour  butter  sugar  salt  i read the review claiming for this to have all sorts of additives   what kind were they eating   is it flavored  unbelievably good,1,0
2180,dan d pak world class cashews  unsalted  32 ounce plastic jars  pack of 2  roasted  this is an absolutely great product  taste is a   unbroken nuts a   packaging a  in a nice  reusable  plastic jug    i have tried most of the cashew options on amazon and all of the highly rated ones  i have tried the large boxes of cashews  isn t quantity supposed to bring the price down  didn t work out so well    i have tried the 4 32 oz  options some are about as good but more expensive   none have surpassed dan d pack for flavor and most have not been in the same class  i love the degree to which they are roasted   not too dried out  not too raw but just right  as in goldilocks   and i never miss the salt  it is a saving in price ounce if they are offered for prime shipping  which was the case the last time i shopped for cashews  which prompted me  once again  to try a large  10 lb   box to save a bit of money  the taste was just ok and there were sooo many broken nuts  an unacceptable portion at the bottom of the sack that would have been usable only as a sprinkle  this definitely was not a saving unless you are only going to use them for cooking   i have never had any such problem with the dan d pak  but i can t over emphasize the quality of the flavor  it is excellent  and that is what i really buy cashews for  in flavor and appearance  they are also perfect to serve to company i won t experiment with other options again  best cashews available and an even better price if you can subscribe,1,0
171,i bought this to try since it was new   or at least i had never heard of it   it has become my favorite  there is no bitter aftertaste that many of the coffees have   i really like it  brooklyn bean breakfast blend k cups,1,0
2087,got this for my dog as the vet advised that she go on a low protein low phosperous diet to maintain kidney health  dog looovvvvessss it  but don t sniff the can  just trust that it smells bad  and keep your nose away    otherwise  you will have regrets    would give this a 5 star except that it doesn t outline how much regular dogfood to feed with it  i m having to play by ear  dog gives it 5 stars,1,0
2088,i read the poor reviews and was concerned about ordering this coffee mix   several reviews complained that it was not a  mix    i was very pleased when i receive my order   i did not get duplicate coffees   the ones by the same maker were all different flavors and it was not full of decaf or tea   i only had 3 teas and didn t see a decaf   the seller may be reading reviews because i was very happy with my order  very pleased with order,1,0
2089,i like this  it s a little heavy for my hair  so i have to wash it out quickly  but it s a great detangler    my hair will dread if you look at it meanly and so detangling is important to me  the only detraction is the heaviness    but all in all  not too bad of a product  if you don t have baby fine hair  it probably wouldn t be heavy  i have thin baby fine hair ,1,0
2090,re  cats love this  i m thrilled to have discovered prime taste treats freeze dried dog treats made from 100  chicken breast  and made in the usa    my cats love this product  pet owners should all know by now to check all food to ensure it s not coming from china or irradiated   another brand of freeze dried chicken treats  beefeaters  is both from china and  irradiated  omg   the beefeater s salmon is usa made and not irradiated  they are ok and my cats love those    i spent hundreds of dollars on numerous pouches of the chicken purebites only to find rancid  slimy pieces in 3 of every 4 pouches i purchased  so much money wasted tossing those pouches out  or purebites will refund  using the excuse that  all fat can t be removed from the chicken  so it s normal to find rancid pieces   but that puts it on the customer to send the bag back to them for a refund  too much work so i gave up   until i found prime taste treats today these prime taste treats have a large window on the front so you can see the actual pieces inside  pieces of nice white chicken chunks that easily crumble down to  cat size  with my fingers without encountering greasy slime like i did far too often with purebites    this product proves that it is possible to eliminate all the fat if one uses a good processing plant i will continue to feed this to my cats as a daily treat  cats are obligate carnivores so pure protein is a great treat or supplement for them   but not to be used to replace a meal because it lacks taurine which is essential for all cat food  this is a  treat   so make sure you are feeding a complete cat food along with these    finally a good freeze dried chicken treat that isn t rancid ,1,0
2091,i use to buy spirulina in mexico where it is a lot more consumed than in the us and way cheaper     after checking various spirulina powder qualities  i decided to buy this organic one from earth circle and i was not disappointed  it s a truly good product  well packed to protect its freshness even though i would have prefered a jar easier to open  and it s easier to take a spoon of this very thin powder from a jar because any wrong move with the spoon when you take it from a bag makes a mess on your kichen counter   very good product,1,0
2092,we talked to the folks at petco and their dog also had cushings   they said their dog responded well to the diet change so not having much to do on the vet s end we gave it a try   our dog did not like the taste at first  but began to prefer this over her old food  natural choice for sensitive stomachs which she had been on for years    it is expensive  which hurts the wallet  but it has been worth it to see the improvement and to see her playing and more active again  helped our ten year old shelter pup with cushings,1,0

2094,this is a reformulated defurr ums hairball treats  reviewed separately    the exact ingredients for comparison are hard to come by   m c does not list them on its website  luckily a few retail websites have an  ingredients  button that forces m c to disclose the major ingredients to its otherwise  proprietary  recipe   the new  concoction made quite a few changes  adding inulin for example and  cranberry   but the changes have not affected acceptability negatively  possibly improved it  judging by our pickiest cat who now accepts it   the only negative change is in the pricepoint   8 vs  4  at which the new package is offered on amazon  petco stores have the new package on sale for  4  until amazon transfers the reviews under the phased out version over to this new  and improved   formula  you might want to take a look at the defurr ums evaluations and also my separate review of hairball remedies under pet naturals hairball  the healthybites iteration is excellent  and i will update this review if its long term performance proves negative  but my opinion of m c customer service stands   lousy    maybe they loaned the service reps to the marketing department during the change in packaging from metallic to white and the switch in names from defurr ums to healthybites  personally  i liked the defurr ums tag  how could you do any better for a hairball remedy than defurr ums  same as defurr ums   close enough     both excellent   ,1,0
168,some dog treats smell horrible and leave stains on the sofa or bedspread where the dog was eating it   these do not have an offensive odor and no stains     very satisfied with the product   my pomeranians love these  pomeranians love these and no stains on furniture ,1,0
2095,beans arrived in a plastic bag instead of plastic container  no big deal same quality as the ones in the grocery store other reviewer has no idea what  sanitary  means and should be ignored  yummy jelly beans,1,0
2096,i love this product  there is nothing better with a little cream in a cup of coffee  or over fresh berries  however  the packaging for shipping was a joke  one of those thin mailer envelopes  not manila  but probably thinner  no padding  no packing material  no invoice  when i pulled it out of the mail box  the envelope was worn  not torn  worn  open and the bottle fell right out  after paying that much for shipping  i was not pleased  at least the bottles are plastic now  and this did not break  would order the syrup again in a heart beat  but not from this seller  the item is great  no thanks to the shipping,1,0
2097,our dogs have always liked the beefeater rawhide sticks  so we decided to try a new flavor  at first both girls were hesitatnt to take begin chewing their sweet potato stix  but they then attacked them with gusto  now they look forward to and enjoy each sweet potato stick we learned the hard way not to give our dogs any chew treats that are too hard  our dental vet showed us how to check a new chew by making sure it flexes in our hands  poor piper broke several teeth chewing on too hard chews these chews are more expensive per chew than the other flavors with fewer chews per pack  my only reservation and the reason for the star subtraction is that this treat is a product of china  beefeaters backs this product with a full satisfaction guarantee  if not fully satisfied beefeaters will send you a replacement  if i were dissatisfied  i think i d prefer a refund  dogs love them but   ,1,0
2098,this is a great product and those who use traps  baits and other strategies to catch critters will find this a better investment the one drawback is the pellets tend to provide results up to 30 days the technology of the product relies on the smell of urine of the predator  of the animal you are trying to remove   thus  once you build a shield by placing the product on the perimeter of your property  you should see  instant results   the product does not kill the animal but simply diverts them to other unprotected areas i ve tried several of havahart products and prefer them over the conventional way of terminating nuisance type intruders  havahart critter ridder,1,0

2100,i just spoke with the manufacturer s usa rep who told me that this product will no longer be distributed in the usa  their replacement sucralose product  ideal  does not contain probiotics   he said the added probiotics just didn t catch on here so they couldn t compete with other brand s no calorie sweeteners   ironically  they still manufacture and sell nevella in many other countries  it s too bad they didn t promote this product  i never saw any advertising about it outside my grocery store  meijer   discontinued in usa markets,1,0

2103,very good product it helps our  completely  indoor cats to maintain a healthy weight   they like it and eat it well   however  based on ordering at least 30 cases  you should expect at least one can per case to be so crushed as to be unusable   two or three other cans per case will be dented  but usable   as the outside packages arrive in good shape the damage must be occuring prior to shipment  great  but occasionally crushed,1,0

166,this is a heavily spiced  authentic crust   is not too much   but the spices which would have cost you an extra couple of bucks to make the crust  are in there    this stuff seems pricy but when you do the math it s perfect   cannot be easier  either   oil and water and toss it into the breadmaker  toss this in a bread machine  and wow ,1,0
2104,i have a lot of food sensitivities that include cane sugar and high fructose corn syrup  i was using pure maple sugar  1 lb  to sweeten the roobois tea i drink  but the powder was a pain in the butt  it had a tendency to fly everywhere at the slightest movement because of how fine it is  i bought this 25 ounce container and i m happy with everything but the high price  which is driven by market factors neither i nor the producer are in control of   maple sugar is better tasting that cane sugar or hfcs  and it doesn t upset my stomach  the container is convenient compared to the bag the barry farms product shipped in  i also like the granules as opposed to the powder  used in my tea,1,0
165,i love these amazing king leo brand peppermint sticks sold by candy crate  they melt away in your mouth  from the first stick to the last  i ve been ordering these from candy crate for years   first on their web site and now from amazon  if you like peppermint  you should try these king leo brand peppermint sticks  i don t know how they make these peppermint sticks so soft  but make them they do   and they are mouth watering  when i first ordered these peppermint stick  i thought they would be hard like all the rest   boy was i surprised   i put that first stick in my mouth and in just a few minutes  it was gone   of course i generally break them in half before putting them in my mouth   that way i can savor them longer   the last order i placed in june 2012 was for 5 boxes because i had run out of boxes  and i hate to do that   leaving me without my favorite candy   and to top it off  these peppermint sticks are low in fat   what a bonus   do watch out for the shipping costs because they tend to add up the more boxes you order as these boxes are heavy   i hope you enjoy these peppermint sticks as much as i do   i am constantly eating them throughout the day   i guess that is why i go through my boxes so quickly  and they may be high in sugar content  but i haven t gained a single pound from eating these sticks  melt in your mouth peppermint sticks,1,0
164,received the order quickly  the tree looked a little weary when i unpacked it from its box  had no leaves but after 2 3 weeks it adjusted to it s new environment and has recovered well  now has about 25 30 leaves after a month and a half  good purchase,1,0
2106,i used to get this tea at thai restaurants when they first appeared in the u s   and at asian groceries as well   then  for some reason  it became harder and harder to find it   thai teas just seemed to all be conventional teas   this tea contains a blend of spices  but it is not chai   i myself like it as hot tea  and i like it without a mess of fattening condensed milk as well this package will make hundreds of cups of tea  so you should put it in a series of air tight containers after opening  so it is not exposed to the air and it doesn t go stale  very hard to find and wonderful tea ,1,0
2107,this is just what i was looking for  our local movie theatre used to use coconut oil but switched to a different oil and the popcorn is just not the same  it takes very little  1 3 tablespoons  oil to pop a large batch of popcorn   comes out light and delicious every time  not a disappointment at all ,1,0
2108,i don t know if some of the previous reviews were written about a different product  or what  granted  this oatmeal does not have the hard lump of brown sugar in the corner of the packet  as i seem to remember from my childhood in the 1970 s  but it hardly tastes so bad that i can t eat it  i thought it was fine  maybe it is not as sweet as it was years ago  but i can t see any ingredient listed on the package that would in any case render the taste as bad as some have said  add more brown sugar if you want to eat candy    and get over it  not that bad ,1,0
163,like the other coffee drink i tried  i wasn t sure what to expect  this time i didn t worry about whether to chill it or not  i didn t shake it  says on the can not to do this  and drank it at room temperature usually i don t like cappucino because it tastes too much like milk and not enough like coffee  this drink had just enough milk in it and more than enough coffee flavor  it wasn t overly sweet either i would definitely buy this and drink this  just the right amount of milk ,1,0
2086,i tried this at wegmans  and it does not taste weird   i don t know why people say it tastes metallic   it tastes just like water   i suppose it s like little kids who won t eat anything green     if you close your eyes and take a sip  thus removing your brain from the equation  all you will taste is water   grow up folks  tastes fine  people ,1,0
2085,i m not a fan of these premixed but i did like this  it was not to sweet  it was not bitter  i shared with my mom and she likes it as well  i may purchase again  interesting   ,1,0
172,i was nervous buying this at first because the description was a bit vague with a bad picture  but when i received the box i discovered huge pieces of all natural papaya which are not at all like the store bought kind   it comes in a plastic bag in a box about the size of a shoe box   this is pure dried papaya and it s a bit leathery  very colorful and flavorful almost like apricots  whereas the stuff you get in stores is more like candy  added sugar and so2  and has a lot of water weight   highly recommended   i am uploading a picture  all natural big pieces with no added sugar,1,0
2084,we all loved them  they taste great  not too sweet and the chocolate chips are amazing  i love the consistancy too  however  i get them through subscribe and save  so i received a couple a stale shipments in the past  it s just something to be aware of  but if my next shipment is disapointing  i ll cancel my subscription and buy them fresh at whole foods  these are a favorite in my house,1,0
181,the coffee is very good  it has mild but not weak flavor  not to strong  but strong enough to wake you in the morning  i would order more but the vendor  pindr  only sent me 86 cups when i paid for 108 cups  shorted,1,0
2060,is it possible for you to have a non stinky chew that your dog is actually interested in      yes      this chew is really hard and feels almost like hard plastic when its dry  but softens up a little when really wet   i got this for my 12 lb shiba puppy  3 months  and he s barely made a dent in it   i initially got the smaller pieces  pet store recommendation   but i thought it was kind of a choking hazard in case i just wanted to leave it out  so i opted for the magnum     my puppy can barely get his mouth around it but he loves this big chew and i m sure it ll last a month or two   this chew doesn t smell and sometimes little pieces come off  but since it hardens  its easy to vacuum up off the carpet   puppy smells like cheese after too   and no staining on carpet or other materials   i gave my neighbor the smaller chews i bought   this product may not really be for super heavy chewers  his dog went through the chew in a day where as my puppy took a week before i got too paranoid and had to microwave it to make a cheesy pouf    30 seconds works well    really great buy  miracle chew,1,0

2063,ironically  my scalp was dry and flakey   no clue why   just as the advertisements for this product started to appear  huh   well  decided give it a shot   other dry scalp shampoos  don t have companion conditioners and quite frankly are good tools if you want to remove hair coloring from your hair  nothing strips it like dandruff shampoos  but this not only in two uses  relieved my itchy dry scalp  it left my hair nice   and has been much gentler on my otc hair color  i like the scent  i use both the shampoo and conditioner  will continue to do so  works for me ,1,0
2065,i m a vegan athlete and so need to get quality plant protein  i love this product as all it contains is hemp powder  no flavorings or added unnecessary processed ingredients  1 serving  3tbsp  gives 15 grams of protein  i mix it in my smoothies  put it in my raw energy bars  and even use it in my veggie burgers  the taste is mild and grassy  if you don t like that  don t buy it  it blends well with other ingredients and the taste can disappear  though  if you only use the serving suggestion  i ve had no unpleasant side effects since using it  and in fact love how it fills me up for all my workouts recommended  i like the taste of grass  if you don t  don t buy it ,1,0
2066,i bought these because im stationed in japan and i just love honey combs  well i recieved them in the mail and sat down in front of the tv with my bowl and spoon  ice cold lactaid milk and poured me a bowl and i must say they were fresh  i thought getting cereal in the mail would come stale and then get them all the way to japan would make matters worse well it didnt i love my honeycombs  they were fresh,1,0

180,let me preface this review by saying i drink iced coffee on the  4  setting of my cuisanart   i liked this coffees flavor and the aroma a lot  it had my whole kitchen scented delicious  which is rare with a k cup and is one of the only things i miss about more traditional brewing    the only down fall was that there was loose grinds in the packaging and they seemed to leak a little during brewing   maybe i am not as picky as others  but the flavor   cost far outweighed that small leakage  good flavor,1,0

2070,i have had green mountain coffee before  but had not tried the french roast   i am just realizing that there is a taste difference between different manufacturers  even with the same types of roasts   the green mountain french roast has the flavor i like and was expecting   the price was reasonable and my order shipped quickly   my only disappointment was in the shipping packaging   i knew that i was ordering 2 boxes of k cups but was surprised to see how big the shipping box was   there was room for 3 boxes  with the extra space filled with bubble wrap  which seems wasteful to me   but on the whole  i am very happy with my coffee  one of my favorite coffees,1,0
2071,i would have to say this granola is not very flavorful  the raisins don t taste like raisins  that s ho bad it is  knowing how healthy this product is with 58  drv of fiber you shouldn t be expecting it to taste good  the lack of taste is tolerable as it s neither disgusting nor exuberantly flavored  very healthy  but at a cost for taste ,1,0
2109,after trying this cookie i can honestly say it was not all that bad   however  i did notice a vitamin like after taste that at times was a bit over powering  i also didn t like how crumbly it is but your gonna eat it anyway so i can over look that not bad,1,0
2072,this and a maui sweet onion dressing are made by a small company in kauai   kauai kookie       and they are great tasting salad dressings  we buy several bottles on our annual trip there and bring them back with us  this particular listing does not say how many bottles one is getting for  17 50  and the vendor will not respond to e mails  so i ordered it direct from kauai kookie for  4 19 per bottle  great dressing   order direct instead,1,0
2074,this is the staple food of all egyptians  it needs to be cooked slowly over several hours  needles to say  it is not feasible to do this at home  and that is why most egyptians buy a foul sandwich on the way to work  this product is very good and is almost equal to the original foul moudammas,1,0
176,well  this was my first ever bonsai tree  and i liked it  i was reading other reviews  and i red about bugs  this freeked  me out  but when i got mine   the first two days were good  i got a little aluminum pan to be my water catcher thing  and around the 3rd day  i noticed ants  so then i looked online for ways to get rid of them  i tried soaking the roots for 10 minuets  like 4 different times  i didnt buy anything  or look to hard around my house for anything  i just realized  the best thing to do was just cut the roots  since you need to anywyas for repotting   that got rid of them one thing that i wish i knew ahead of time was pruning  they say give it one growing season before re potting  but my pot was nothing but roots  it was overflowing with roots  hardly any soil  and i got it in the winter  so i cut the roots  re potted  right before spring  and man did it do amazing the ant problem was gone  but then i noticed i had aphids  soo  i started researching that too  so what i ended up doing was just mixing some spices i had around my house  i found the most dryest spiciest most fine seasonings i had  mixed it with water  and sprayd the plant that got rid of them  and didnt harm the plant at all i rate this a 4 out of 5 because  it came to me in about 6 or so days   from cali to ohio  which was fine with me  but the ammount of work i needed to put in took to long figuring out how to get rid of the ants  and aphids they had ants and aphids in the first place  but cant really blame them  its a plant  no bigdeal  i cought them before they could really wreck the plant just besure for when you prune the roots i tried to get better soil  and re cut the roots right before may 1st  and now its dead  i think i cut tomany roots but the bug problem was long gone  so i know it wasnt that  i waterd it daily  it had sun  so my guess would be the root pruning but hey  i learnd alot since then  did even more research  soi recomend this tree to anyone  just besure you check the roots  and look for aphids  mine were white tiny bugs  died if you touched them because theyre so soft  and i just shook the tree  and some of them fell off  thats how i knew i even had them pardon my spelling and or grammer  good start,1,0
2075,extremely good for not being raw and being bottled canned   i have had better  but only raw in the nut   i have had equal  but only in bottles from other boutique brands or labeled  raw  but in the bottle   i won t even buy naked or one anymore  just to weak and stale  poor remnants of their fresh selves   disclosure   i ve bought mine of this brand elsewhere  but am glad to see it here for easier access and am ordering now   this is fantastic for being available on amazon  closest to cracking open a coconut yourself,1,0
2076,the seeds arrived in a small plastic baggy with instructions to soak and sow  i let them soak in water overnight  sowed them in some starting seed soil  and they began to germinate rapidly  i think just about all 25 have germinated within a week and a half  i am pleased with this purchase and am excited to watch them grow  fast to germinate,1,0
2077,to me  the quality of the coffee flavor was good  what i would expect from illy   with smoothness rather than bitterness  however  the amount of coffee flavor is a bit too weak  so that the flavor of the sugar and milk dominate more than they should  and i didn t even realize that there was any cocoa in it until i read the ingredients it is much better than the bottled starbucks frappuccino  because the frappuccino has way too much sugar compared to this one  so if you want a sweet milky coffee drink  this is the one to get small print   it was  produced for  and  distributed by  coca cola  product of denmark  move over frappuccino  but could be even less sugared ,1,0

174,we own a condo in florida and i constantly have to be aware of the humidity when we aren t there   what i like about these packages is that for one thing it s portion control and for another it is manufacturer sealed so i can leave them down there  when we get there the next time  i don t have to run out to the store to buy cereal for the next day   which means i can leave them at the condo over the summer and the humidity won t affect them while i would have preferred to have purchased a smaller amount of boxes  i will most likely wind up donating some of them to the local soup kitchen originally  i got some at a hotel and used them down there   that s how i found out how convenient they were   while more expensive than purchasing a large box of the cereal  once opened i can t leave the box of cereal down there but i can leave these  good portion control  manufacturer sealed,1,0
2079,wheat makes my kidney s hurt  gives me migraines  and does unpleasant things to my stomach  i have tried other gluten free breads and they were not worth the money i spent on them  this however is incredible  it did not even taste like gluten free bread  it tasted like bread  i ve been making my chicken  swiss  and tomato sandwiches every day and they re so good   the only thing that could make this bread better is a better price  it s  5 a loaf and some of the ingredients are not expensive ones  i hope the price goes down  oh udi s you have brought sandwiches back into my life,1,0
173,well    they re almonds  nothing special there  i don t really know how  bad almonds  or  good almonds  taste  but these taste like the generic almonds i ve had all my life  they are split up into smaller bags  which makes it really convenient  i can keep a small bag at the office  one next to the bed  etc  paying extra for shipping makes me sad  but as far as i could see  they were still the cheapest ones on amazon  i ve just been eating them raw  so i guess i ll try cooking with them and see how that ends up  almonds,1,0
2080,this is a worcestershire base mix  and it s quite good   hot but not too hot  although horseradish is a listed ingredient  i don t taste horseradish in the mix  i prefer horseradish type mixes  and i tried this mix largely because horseradish was a listed ingredient and the reviews were excellent although i don t regret the purchase  i doubt i would buy it again  quite good but not enough horseradish,1,0
2081,my daughter loved my free sample of this cookie from influenster  she goobled it right down  which i didn t think she would  she s not the biggest fan of rasins  i tried a bite and thought it was kinda dry myself but if my daughter loves it  i will buy it again     quaker soft backed oatmeal cookie,1,0
2082,i absolutely loved this cookie  i received this as a free sample but i couldn t just have one so i went out on a search for them and found them at my grocery store  i was so happy because that one big cookie was everything i have been looking for  not too sweet  not too bland  not salty  not too many rasins and most of all not many calories  the perfect snack  especially with a cup of tea and a book    quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie,1,0
2083,i used thes on a recent trip while i was driving long distances  i was grateful they kept me hydrated and i enjoyed the flavor  although i found it weak and used two it wasn t a very lemon flavor  in fact i didn t discern a specific flavor  mostly i discerned the  sweet   i use two,1,0
2073,if you know what rooibos tastes like  this is an excellent version  but if not  beware  this is not black tea  or a  substitute   if you are expecting that flavor  well this is not it  if you are trying to cut back on your caffeine  this is a smart choice  it has a pleasant flavor  once you get accustomed to it  but yikes folks  this is not black tea  as a vegetarian i eat various burger shaped things that are not real meat  the caustic cynic says   well  not as good as a real burger   ok maybe not  but they aren t as bad as  a real burger either  they are two different things  and if you think one is the other  as opposed to being something that serves a similar purpose  then you will be dissatisfied but if you say   i enjoy a hot beverage with some punch  but can t do the caffeine   then these are a good value  trust me  i ve been using rooibos for over 30 years  this is a great price on a good tea and  the bags are not wrapped individually  i hate throwing away all that foil lined paper that will last forever  these teabags come in a ziploc bag that can be re used  quite satisfactory,1,0
2110,all i can say about these treats is they are not too nasty  they smell ok  and they are not slimy   and my dogs like them  they are very easy to break into smaller pieces  which is good since each one is about the size of an oreo cookie  recommended  my dogs like them,1,0
2111,just made my very first gluten free loaf of bread using bobs red mill flour  definitely not as glorious as a loaf of regular white flour bread fresh out of the oven  but not a terrible substitute  next on the agenda  gluten free pita wraps  i think i can actually live with this new change in diet  even thrive  already feeling more energy and less anxiety     but i can t speak for everyone as this is the first gluten free flour i have tried  not too bad ,1,0
2112,must be potent stuff  bag is large but not too large wherein the nip looses it potency  only need a small pinch at a time   barely got this out of the shipping box before kitty was balled up on the floor frantically tearing at the bag  good to put on scratching post as well  will definately buy again  yeowww,1,0
2151,quick look at tropical blossom wild honey pros  1  taste good 2  looks rawcons  1  not boxed well 2  advertised quantity misleading 3  darker than pictureddetails we received the tropical blossom wild honey today  it came in a package with several items ordered and came without any protection around it  it is a heavier plastic container and it does have an internal foil cover so added protection may not have been necessary but  the same package had loose metal tools included   nothing leaked or was broken but certainly the possibility was there we immediately opened the bottle for a taste test   it has a caramel  fruity quality to it that is quite pleasant and does not leave an aftertaste  it looks to be as advertised  raw and unfiltered  though i would say somewhat unfiltered because it is cleaner than some honey i have purchased that seems like it was pressed out by barefoot kids in a tub  it is a little darker than the picture  it is definitely a keeper considering our taste test cons  most of the honey producers we have dealt with list their honey in fluid ounces or in pounds   the conversion to weight makes a big difference in pricing for the fluid ounce measurement   this advertiser states 48 ounce bottle  well  the bottle surely isn t a 48 fluid oz bottle as you might be led to believe   so if you thought it was 48 fluid ounces of honey and you just got 3 lbs of honey you just paid a premium for your honey because 48 fluid ounces of honey should be 4 5 lbs  the advertisement should state 3 lbs  of honey  a 48 ounce bottle is misleading and maybe done so on purpose  i m amazed that other reviewers mixed the terms and didn t catch this  if it doesn t say quart or pounds i guess the question needs to be asked up front about what we are buying  it makes one appreciate the  dutch gold company  with their  bulk orange blossom honey   5 lb    no mistake here and they have great packaging bottom line     i paid  4 90 lb verses  3 25 lb  but it does taste good  generally i try to keep the price to  3 lb and have received a good value like from  honeydabber  on ebay though the product comes in thermally sealed bags for that price  also the dutch gold company on amazon does it right too   if it were not for the good flavor and what appears to be raw honey as advertised i would have given this three  3  stars because of the duplicity of the advertisement   they are not the only ones to do this so buyer beware  tropical 48 ,1,0

2153,this sauce has a nice and sweet bbq flavor that is an interesting new twist  i m looking forward to trying it with some fish  or maybe sushi  the ingredients caught my eye immediately and i knew i d be trying this one day  but what sealed the deal was the 1 000 000 su rating in the product description  don t get me wrong  it s still very hot  but it doesn t compare to satan s blood or mad dog 357 silver  800 000 and 750 000 s u  respectively   in the end it s got a solid flavor and enough heat to join alongside blair s after death as my go to sauces  good  but not quite what i expected ,1,0
148,as a  stage one  food  meant for 6 months old babies  this serves its purpose   introduce the baby to new food textures and to tastes other than milk  it s a time when babies continue to receive most of their nourishment from milk but they are now taught to accept and eventually enjoy some variety it shouldn t come as a surprise that the product contains no protein  it s meant to be that way  everything else appears to be clean and well balanced  the taste mild enough to ensure acceptance from the baby and everything  according to the makers  coming from an organic source  at 40 calories per serving  2 servings per pouch  it will not make a baby fat unless the baby was fed a couple of pouches per feeding session we found the packaging to be convenient because the little bags are easy to store and to dispose but not everyone may  get  squeezable pouches contents  for brevity  i will not write  organic  before each of the ingredients but the maker claims they are so    pear  broccoli  spinach  lemon juice concentratealso  ascorbic acid  source of vitamin c other features   things that it does not have   no fillers or thickeners  no salt or sugars  no dairy  egg or lactose  no gluten  no nutsi can t see how you can go wrong with this  it s worth trying giving it to a 6 months old baby  if the baby rejects it  you can still try again a couple of weeks later  our test subject seems to enjoy the treat                                       note and    yes  the cap and the pouch itself are potential chocking hazards but  so is just about anything else in the house so make sure that the little one is not given the opportunity to try to swallow either  stage one treat,1,0
147,why should i review a product that amazon has stopped selling    it was good and inexpensive  but what can be done now  i looked on e bay and found 2 44oz bottles for  202  are they kidding     of course there were others for  68 but there was one seller for  35 for 2 bottles plus  12 99 shipping and handling  even the 10 bottles that amazon had left were  28 for 2  i guess that wholesome sweetners was just getting very expensive  because my last auto shipment was just  16 for the 2 bottles then amazon cancelled my auto subscription  so  even though it is a good product i don t recommend buying it at any price more that  10 per 44 oz bottle wbrewsr my loss,1,0
2156,i love this stuff  too bad they don t make it anymore  the have a  new  babydog formula but it s just not the same in my opinion  i bought up every last bag i could find of this stuff  no longer on the market   ,1,0
2158,a good year round or hot weather product  i like cold brewing this tea with 3 teabags in a 2 quart pitcher for 6 to 8 hours  it s relatively strong  robust  and undistinguished  but it s also not expensive and  wears well  with repeated uses  please do not consider lipton s so called cold brew  that one s basically dust that ends with a bitter  almost undrinkable outcome  this is the way to go  for all year long or summer,1,0
2159,i like this sweetener and have not found it to be too syrupy like others have commented   i found that if you wipe the rim after using  it will reduce the possible chance of it dripping  as i read from other reviews   the price was great as well   i like the flavor  to me it doesn t have a strange aftertaste  easily dissolvable  convenient  virtually calorie free sweetener,1,0
145,this is not the same old tomato based hot sauce  it is an imaginative take on a spice sauce that works well on just about anything from hamburgers and barbecue to beans and rice  it s not available at the grocer where i live   but it s coming soon  so  i have to order it online  the vendor was great  the product was shipped when promised and arrived in an earth friendly package bottom line  i love this sauce and use it all the time  definitely not the same old sauce,1,0

144,mio does not contain the ingredient aspartame  which is found is nearly every single sugar free drink  studies have shown that aspartame increases the chances of cancer  possibly raising your blood sugar   there are many who steer clear of aspartame  though i am not one of them  i really like the mio strawberry watermelon  that one has really great flavor  what i like about the mio over crystal light is  sometimes when you make drinks using crystal light  it takes a few minutes for all the powder in the crystal light to dissolve  and it you don t wait  you might get small chunks of powder which is really gross  with the mio this is not an issue  it instantly dilutes into the water and you do not have to shake it violently or wait  mio is better for you than other sugar free drinks,1,0

2165,i have tried countless korean brands of roasted nori    this brand rates very high for flavor  freshness and lack of oiliness   some brands have pools of oil in the individual bags  some are soggy    these are very light   be careful with the chipotle    i love spicy  but these just burned my tongue and i could not enjoy the flavor    make sure you have some sort of dairy or cucumber available to absorb the heat  crispy  not  oily  but beware  chipotle,1,0
150,our son only eats hot dogs some thought we would try making some   we used a frankfurter recipe and ground chicken   these casings  while gross  are easy to untangle  clean  and feed onto the machine after cooking they tasted delicious and didn t get gummy or gross like the gelatin type   if you can get past what they are  pig intestines  they really work well   would recommend a smaller size for hot dogs  gross but cool,1,0
2166,the packaging is small and there are only a few bears inside   however  the few bears inside are smaller than your average gummi bear   one positive is that because they are individually packaged  the non consumed bears will stay fresh longer   i guess and inherent positive will be that it can control portions  mini gummi bears,1,0
143,shipping was fine  it was one of those packs you see at costco and placed in a box for shipment  good deal at around a dollar a bottle  the drink is made from splenda and plenty sweet  almost taste like a regular juice drink  one of the better tasting diet drinks out there as there are no funky after taste to this  i don t prefer this flavor as the as there is a strong acai berry taste to it  i hope amazon starts selling the fruit punch version soon  the fruit punch version tastes like regular fruit punch but a diet version  i probably wont order this flavor again but no stores near where i live sells this  other vendors sell this for close to  3 a bottle after shipping  best tasting splenda drink with no after taste ,1,0
142,my dog loves these antlers and this is by far the biggest one i ve gotten from a seller  i m impressed  they last a long time too and don t chip off and leave splinters to get in my feet  they also don t smell or make my dog s breath smell  our home will buy nothing else from here forward  see the picture i posted of our schnauzer to the board with his new antler     big and tasty,1,0
2169,that s about it   we were trying very actively  with opks  the whole shebang  with no luck for over 4 months    so i got this tea and 2 weeks after drinking it every day  i got pregnant   also  this may be tmi  but i got a moon cup  which i read could help facilitate conception  and i used it after sex every time    so not sure which of the two did it  or if either did it  but for someone looking for help  it s not too much investment  and the moon cup seemed like it would be an amazing menstrual solution    i haven t gotten to use it for that purpose yet   due in jan 2013  good luck to all you ladies who are ttc  pregnant 2 weeks after starting tea drinking regimen,1,0

2171,i bought the whole bean variety and ground it right before brewing in my  admittedly cheap  underwhelming  drip coffee maker on the  strong  setting   i m an avid fan of dark roasts  and this is not dark   the beans were dry and brittle out of the package with no oils whatsoever on them and left no residue on the inside of my blade grinder   the acidity seems pretty high  and the flavor falls between a light breakfast blend and a traditional colombian roast   don t let this scare you off if you like the darker roasts  though   it has an earthy  though not  dark roast  intense   flavor that is usually lacking to me in lighter roasts   overall  i m pretty impressed at the moment and plan on running some through my french press in the morning  hopefully bringing out some of the nuances  pretty good for a lighter roast,1,0
2172,bought this item for a picnic this weekend  had the order expedited to get it on time  when i went to tracking it had went to philadelphia  pa  i was not a happy person  it ended up arriving today but still do know now why it said philadelphia and not my city i needed it to be shipped to clear on the other side of pa  not sure about buying from here again  sent to a different city,1,0
2173,  the appearance of the olives are high in quality and you can tell that   grabers  was very selective in the olives that were being canned   the olives are unpitted   the taste is a lot like the black olives that you would find in a grocery store  with somewhat of a more buttery taste   the texture of the olives is not as firm as the canned black olives but softer   in a good way  but not mushy  having said this  i think they are a bit overpriced  especially if you are paying for shipping  and i wouldn t buy a second can for  12 99    but that s just me  some  personally  may really like them enough to get them because they are not common in grocery stores but i buy a lot of olives and have tried many varieties from brined to oil cured and from different countries and honestly  to me  these taste just like the common canned black olives  good quality  canned olives  but not that agreeable about the price,1,0
2174,i highly recommend this seller  it is an incredible value for both quantity and quality of beans  there are probably around 50 60 beans  although i m not positive because i have not taken them out of the packaging to count  i have probably used about 8 10 beans and i can barely tell any are gone from the bag  they come double sealed  and as another reviewer mentioned  you can smell the vanilla even through the original shipping package  i have purchased grocery store vanilla beans  and i have never seen or tasted anything remotely close to the quality of these beans  i will definitely purchase beans from this seller again  impressive,1,0
2175,just used the product for the first time   i have used wylers chicken cubes before but with the herbs not until today   it has a very good taste and not bland like regular bouillon broth   i will have no problem at all just sipping on a cup   i also made skinny mashed potatos with the cubes and it gave the mashed potatos a nice boost and i didnt have to add any other spices to it   1 bouillon cube per cup of water    easy wyler s instant bouillon chicken herb cubes,1,0
140,the product is very good and i like it but what i don t like and i must know before i make my order the product date  i discover when i receive the product that expire in 12 6 2012 about one month and i order tow box that you must but the date of expire expire date,1,0
2177,i bought this product as a gift for a friend who likes to try various foods  but i noticed that it is way too salty   perhaps if you could wipe it off  or but the unsalted one it would taste better  but i simply think that if they reduced the salt to nut ratio  this would be a much better product   i would not buy it again  but if you are dying to have some macadamia nuts from amazon that comes with good value  this would be an okay purchase  it s really salty   ,1,0
2178,i have a boston terrier who has been on this product for quite some time  i tried a bunch of different foods before this  but they all had various problems  and she had a very sensitive stomach  this food works wonderfully for her and i ve had no problems with loose stools one thing to be sure of  if you re transitioning to this food  is to not do it suddenly  that may cause problems with the dog  including diarrhea   my vet advises slowly transitioning over to a new food  blending it in the old  and taking 1 2 weeks before the new food fully replaces the old  completely changing the food can have a bad effect on some dogs with sensitive stomachs  works for my pup ,1,0
2179,first off  the product is great  so i m giving it 5 stars  i love these drinks  and at 99 cents they are cheap too  i got to thinking  if they are so cheap and i like them so much  i should try to buy a case  my first thought was to come to amazon where i do a lot of my online shopping  but i was amazed to see how ridiculously expensive they are here   30 40 for a 24 pack  when they sell for 99 cents a piece   other big name bulk stores have these cases for less than  20  not sure why exactly they are so expensive here  but definitely look elsewhere  love these  but not from amazon ,1,0
2167,took very little of the colored gel to produce vibrant colors until the old standby dropper liquid food dyes that take the whole bottle and barely give the hue one needs for dying foods  i will definitely be buying this product again  a great product,1,0
139,these gummy bears are tasty and slightly larger than the standard ones   i don t know how authentic the pineapple flavor is  but if you re the sort of person who always pulls the clear looking gummy bears out of the bag first  these are the ones for you one complaint  there is no product information on the bag   no ingredients list  no nutritional information  nothing   if you go to the seller s website  the ingredients and nutritional information are listed there   ingredients  corn syrup  sugar  gelatin  citric acid  sorbitol  natural   artificial flavors  vegetable oil  carnauba wax  120 calories in a serving  all from sugar   which is 12 gummy bears    the packaging is clearly custom and well made  so i can t think why they wouldn t include something so basic  excellent gummy bears but no labeling,1,0
2149,i used to feed my then two month old puppy chicken jerky treats from sams  it was cheap and he loved it  however  he started getting bloody diarrhea  this happened twice before i finally realized it was the jerky by researching this online  since my puppy was also eating greenies  zuke s chicken treats  milk bones  milk bones trail mix  iams puppy dog food  royal canin food  digestion formula   puppy vitamins  platos chicken treats  natures recipe food and treats  his puppy trainer s treats  and benadryl  he has dermatitis   it was hard to pinpoint what the cause was  but once i figured it out  i stopped the waggin train and switched to platos  although these treats are more expensive and contain preservatives  it does seem a better alternative to liver failure or sudden death some pet owners were experiencing with chicken jerky treats as for the seemingly biased reviews against jerky treats coming from china  i am a first generation chinese immigrant with family back east  and i love them and where i am from  but shady practices are abound in china  so no xenophobia driven bias here  i have seen the damage done to my pup by chinese treats  and these platos treats are definitely a safer bet the fda statement regarding chinese chicken treats can be found here       great treat  alternative of chicken jerky,1,0
2147,personally i enjoy coffee drinks from local stores and even canned drinks  so when i ordered this one i had high hopes  sadly i wasn t as excited about it as i thought i would be  the drink is ok and in a pinch will satisfy a craving but overall if i had other choices i would not choose this one  not as great as i had hoped,1,0
2113,i love the variety  but the description says coffee only  it was not coffee only   there was cider in it  it isn t the end of the world  but i would expect that it would have been coffee only  says coffee only  but it is not,1,0
2114,what i m about to share is sacred information and shouldn t be shared with just anyone  that s why i m sharing it on the privacy of amazon   when i was 8 years old i didn t like strawberry jelly very much   i preferred grape   my parents realized my dislike for strawberry jam and bought the grape flavor for most of my childhood instead   now don t give me a weird look when i tell you this next part  but even at that young and innocent age i was actually able to predict that the day would come way in the distant future when i d not only welcome the taste of strawberry jelly  but prefer it to the much beloved grape variety   20 years later    and my premonition came true   i do prefer strawberry jam to grape   i love it now   it s frightening and mysterious how such a prediction came to be a reality   however don t be foolish and buy it here on amazon  it s expensive and not worth it   the store prices are much much cheaper and more dependable  smucker s jam,1,0
162,the coffee was good but didn t have a strong flavor  wouldn t buy this product again  nice to try new products and try new flavors  coffee was good but not a strong flavor ,1,0
2117,i m not exactly sure how to review this product    i mean    it s dog food  it s not like i ate any of it myself  my dogs ate it  they seemed to like it  but they also eat their own vomit  cat poop  and anything plastic that sits in the yard for longer than 30 minutes  their tastes aren t very discriminating  according to the bag it s supposed to be a pretty healthy dog food for them  of course  they eat a lot of grass and wild jack rabbits in addition to the other delectable treats previously mentioned  so i m not too concerned about the balance of their diet  it s dog food ,1,0
161,since i bought my keurig i felt the coffee wasn t as rich as coffee you slow brew  i bought starbucks  caribou and many other brands  it wasn t that i dislike the coffee but i did not get the same satiisfaction   the first cup of the french roast i really felt it had such a good flavor   i m hoping they start selling more flavors  much richer flavor than normal k cups,1,0
160,tastes just like the wasabi in stores and restaurants  you get about twice the amountof product for the money than in the stores  grocery shopping by  internet has a future  a o k ,1,0
2120,i read the reviews and i thought  eh  give it a try  i bought it as a gift for someone who eats caviar regularly  this would probably be good for someone who is not that familiar with caviar   i was told that the flavor was okay and the eggs were very very small   it s a good value for the price but i should have known to get better  taste was pretty good for the price  but the caviar was very small,1,0
2121,wondering what the uproar over the labeling of this product is about  according to cento  they stopped paying extra to get the dop label  but those with the new  certified  label are the same tomatoes grown in the same region of italy as the cans with the old  dop  label  it would appear the different labels make the product taste different to some  certified vs  dop,1,0

2125,i must agree with the previous review  i don t care for the new lipton tea to go with honey  i also hope it flops  the original tea to go was really good and i bought it all the time  amazon s price is outrageous  scalping at it worst  no longer available,1,0
159,we have a 9 year old 120 lb  mastiff sheepdog mix that has had ear infections her entire life  she has been to 3 different vets to remedy the problem  and nothing helped  i had to clean her ears and use a cortizone remedy for yeast a least 3 times a week or her ears became enflamed and were painful  i heard about the blue dog food  and i liked the ingredients used  so we decided to try it  i couldn t believe that within 2 weeks  her ears were no longer squishy with fluid inside  and the smell went away  we have been using both the dry and the canned blue formulas and after 2 months there has been no recurrence of infection or inflammation  in the 9 years we have had her  we have tried at least 4 other brands of dog food including some of the high end expensive ones  it had never dawned on us that her food might be causing the infections in her ears  thanks to blue dog food  our girl will not have to endure the pain of ear infections the rest of her life  no more ear infections     ,1,0
2127,i read a few reviews on here that mention quaker reformulated its maple brown sugar instant oatmeal  i ve been eating it for thirty years and can t tell the difference  lol  it is what it is  i guess  you re not getting top of the line  steel cut oats  you re getting a basic instant oatmeal  a fast  hot breakfast that doesn t take 20 minutes to freakin  cook  it is what it is,1,0
2148,this product works to keep critters out of specific areas  but seems to only work directly where it is applied i was hoping to also use it as perimeter control  sprinkling around my barn to keep out cats  skunks  etc  however as a perimeter control it didn t seem to work when i applied directly to the corners in the barn that were being used for nesting it cleared out those areas  but the critters found somewhere else to make a home  i kept tracking these areas down and applying more repellent and eventually it seems the critters are gone  works  in direct areas  not as perimeter ,1,0
2130,i had been using two packets of wholesome organic stevia percup of coffee and liked the taste but not the cost   so itried the now better stevia organic powder  it did have a bitteraftertaste if i used too much of it  but if i use just a tiny amount   around 1 8 t   maybe less    per cup of coffee  my tongue registersthe sweetness while the bitterness is barely there  obviously one pound of the now stevia is going to last a long  long time however  it would be better if it had no bitterness at all  soi gave it only 4 stars  very economical,1,0
2133,my guest thought the candy was cute for my baby shower  one thing that sucked was some bags came with 2 1 pieces  i didn t have enough time to order more  i made do what i had  candy ,1,0
157,i ordered these because they are easier to get then to drive to around town looking for them  when i opened the pack it had a horrible smell i mean i know what they are but every other brand i buy don t smell also when i went and soaked a few test cases 1 2 looked normal and 1 2 looked like it was still dried out and that was after about 2 hours of soaking because i thought it was just dry still but no that s just the way it looks anyway they taste fine worth a try but im still going to buy another brand next time to see if there any better easy to get,1,0
154,i like the do it yourself squeeze concept for a few reasons  first you control how much you want to put in  i personally like my drinks not too sweet so i ll only use a little  and depending on how much energy you want you can control that as well  and if you figure out how many drinks you can make with this bottle it s very cost effective  you control the potency and taste,1,0
2135,how can i know an expiry date for this jams i couldn t find a date in any bottle please let me know an expiry date  expiry date for this ,1,0
153,this fog chaser was available at my local grocery store  i thought i would give it a try  well let me tell you  even on the highest setting this cup is strong  reminds me of a regular pot of dark communittee coffee  if you think the regular k cups are just too weak  give this a try and you won t be disappointed  strongest k cup coffee out there,1,0
152,not much to say  there are some pistachios that haven t been opened up properly  but most of them are just fine  sometimes you can taste the sweetness  i had no idea they could be sweet   i ran through them pretty quickly  an open bag just vanishes like that  i ll probably buy some more from this seller  they re pistachios,1,0
2138,normally   i would not be sucked into the hype of one shampoo being better than the next  however   my wife wanted to try this and recommended i try it also i was quite surprised with the results  the shampoo felt great being applied   and after finishing the bottle   i have been able to see the results maybe shampoo isn t just shampoo after all is shampoo just shampoo  ,1,0
2139,updated review i was forced to use this on a recent 75 mile ride and i must say i was too hasty in my earlier review  this worked very well  i still won t get another can  but it is good to know that it works as advertised previous review i love gu gel so i thought i would give this a try on bike rides lasting longer than 2 hours  this don t taste as great and is not as effective as perpetuem from hammer  there is no protein component in this mix  the ratio in perpetuem has worked well for me  this roctane drink failed miserably  i will finish the canister during my workouts at the gym  revised from disappointed to not bad,1,0
2140,original review    i thought i had purchased salt with almonds in it  the amount of salt is ridiculous and very unhealthy  almonds are a healthy snack but not if they are this salty update    i contacted the company and they provided a replacement  the new bag was perfect  the almonds were tasty and not too salty  it seems that i purchased a bag from a bad batch  the company was prompt at correcting the problem  i originally gave the product a 1 star rating  i m updating the review and giving the product 4 stars  purchased a bag with way too much salt   company provided a replacement  almonds were perfect,1,0
2141,ok good people this is very funny and all  but some actually think this is a real product  shouldn t we be preventing this company to profit from ignorance  this is a very old joke that became a hoax  you know it  i know it  but some don t  and it is not like the company is giving it away for free   amazon do you allow this  very funny,1,0
151,i thought i hated whole wheat pasta   i really did  the way it tasted  the way it lacked any sort of chewy texture and just broke off at the slightest pressure  the horrible things it would do to my digestive system afterwards  causing pain and nausea  however  i am trying to slow sugar release from carbs so i stuck with it as much as i could  barely tolerating a half and half mixture now and then then i stumbled across a website rating whole wheat pastas  i am ashamed to admit i never thought there was a difference  all of the dried white pasta tasted the same to me  so i thought whole wheat would too  what can i say  i m a small town gal whose only access to pasta is what i can find on the prego aisle  so bolstered by the reviews and affordable pricing of this brand  i placed an order so glad i did  this pasta is fantastic  the taste  the texture   oh so good  others mention a nutty flavor  and there is a slight difference in taste  but what i love about it is the texture  i can twirl spaghetti on my plate again and not worry about half of the strands breaking off before it makes its way to my mouth  and there s no discomfort or nausea afterward  i m never going back to white pasta again  cleared out my shelves and donated unopened boxes of barilla and dreamfields to the food bank  bionaturae is here to stay  there s wheat and then there s bionaturae,1,0
2144,our dogs like crunchy chews  but they can t be too hard  we made that mistake with poor piper who lost a few teeth biting on chews that were way too hard for her petite mouth  our canine dentist advised that we not give our dogs any chews that we couldn t bend with our hands  these beefeaters pass the test our dogs tell us they like the taste and crunch of these chews  we also notice that these chews leave no stains behind and no crumbs either i had to reduce the rating my one star because these beefeaters are a product of china  i find this disconcerting  but we ve never had any negative reactions in our dogs from the beefeaters ingredients  rawhide  rice flour  red  40  chicken flavorvisiting the beefeaters web page and reading about the quality control measures taken through the manufacuring process reassures me somewhat  our dogs like these,1,0

2146,this is my favorite creamer  but unless you don t have access to a sam s club or walmart why pay more than double the price   not sure if the walmart creamer has same brand name but it has the same flavor and comes in large containers   i am going to go there tomorrow and restock if they have it if not it s next stop sam s   i would like to buy from amazon and save a trip to the store  even with cost of gas it s still cheaper to go to store  if i can resist all the other products there  my favorite creamer   minus 1 star for price,1,0
158,as another reviewer noted  these are very spicy but that s about it  there is no other real flavor there  don t get me wrong  i bought these for heat and that is certainly delivered so what i did  is i also ordered some other spicy peanuts here that are big on flavor but not really that spicy for someone that looks for ghost pepper style and i will blend the two together  whoa     nice flavor and heat  this are extremely spicy     but    ,1,0

85,i have been a polar tuna customer for about four years now   polar is by far superior than any other brand you can buy   until recently i was on the automatic reorder program for my polar with amazon  and for  38 00 a case for 24 cans that was truely a great deal   then a couple of months ago amazon informed me that they were cancelling that program   i was very disappointed   i contacted polar  who were kind enough to respond to me almost immediately  and amazon and was told that there was a problem between amazon and polar but they hoped to resolve the issue and once again start selling polar on amazon   keep in mind that i have told many people about this polar product and they also were buying it from amazon  well sure enough last month polar was now available from amazon again but now it was a bit higher in price   8 dollars a case more but still with free shipping   still a great deal   i ordered two cases which arrived promptly and stacked them on the shelf   now for those of you who have never opened a can of polar let me explain that when you open a can and squeeze out the water the lid barely compresses  i mean the water comes out but the lid barely moves and when you remove it whats inside is a can full of tuna not this mush you get with other brands   i m sorry to say that thats  not the case with the polar i recent recieved   there is definately more water and less tuna now in the cans   the lid compresses much further down in the can  more water comes out and the huge chunk of tuna left inside the can is now more chunks instead of a huge chunk of tuna  i m sure there is still six ounces inside the can  but the ratio of tuna to water is definately less tuna and more water   still a bargain but not the great deal it use to be   i realize that every food manufacturer is doing it with their products but it is a big dissappointement to me that it has happened with polar  just another example of greed and giving the consumer less for their money  more is now less,1,0
2477,this is a reall kick in the ass  jeez  i love strong coffee but seriously i had to cut down on my consumption  er maybe it s a bit too strong when i get the shakes  especially since i drink coffee like water    i am torn between loving it and not wanting a hart attack  hmm which is more important  being awake  reallly awake  and being in a cardiac unit at the local hospital  hmm did i pay my health insurance this month  anyway like i said very good coffee but beware  if possible maybe too strong ,1,0
2478,i received my package in tact and could not wait to taste them   the product was fresh and tasted like it did when i ate it growing up   you do get a lot for the money   i will definitely order from this company again  just like i remembered,1,0
31,i have enjoyed the  original  breathsaver spearmint mints for years  recently i ordered some online that had the same image as these  i e   an image of the  original  spearmint  but when i received them  they were the breathsaver spearmint  3 hour  variety  an entirely different taste  not as pleasant  this item  however  is the real stuff  the  original  mints that i am used to  tasty  thanks  these are the  original  breathsaver spearmint mints ,1,0
2480,this canned salmon is the real deal  it doesn t have a pungent fishy smell and it consists of mostly large chunks  yes there s skin and bones  but the bones are brittle and edible  not to mention full of minerals   i can eat it straight out of the can with just a little salt and pepper  for wild caught  farmed raised salmon isn t real food  alaskan salmon  this stuff is great  great way to eat seafood on the go,1,0
30,i ordered the 10 pound case of unsalted sunflower seeds and within 5 days the package arrived   i opened it to find it contained pumpkin seeds   i reviewed the return policy and realized that i would be responsible for return shipping  which was half of the price of the product itself   i emailed the company and they were quick to apologize for their error and offered my money back or to ship the correct item   i chose to have them send the correct item and it arrived within 5 days and they told me to keep the pumpkin seeds   great customer service and both the sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds are great quality   i would definitely order from them again  i would have given this company a 5 star rating except for the small error they made  good product,1,0
29,i find just about all earl greys taste the same to be  unless they have a creme note in them   this tea is good  but reminds me of average earl grey  no bells or whistles here   i like the design of the box  especially the part where the bags come out of and the bags brew well  it does taste like average earl grey,1,0
2481,review of grove square medium roast k cups yes  this is instant coffee  no  they don t make that abundantly clear  here s why i like it anyway 1  i m not a coffee aficionado  so subtleties in flavor are lost on me  and a brutally strong  i guess you coffee fans call that  robust    coffee is off putting  i just want two simple  basic cups of caffeine  er  coffee every morning 2  on the same note  i don t care to pay a lot of money for my basic daily coffee  this product is priced tolerably enough 3  this instant coffee tastes far better than the kind that comes loose in a jar  that stuff is awful  some reviews have said this is the same  i disagree 4  when my keurig produces a  short cup   doesn t use enough water in the brew cycle   it doesn t work to  re brew  a k cup of actual coffee grounds  but it works fine with this product  no wasted k cups  i ve also found that short cupping happens far less often with this product  my hypothesis is that the brew process for this requires creates less pressure in the cup than that of  real  coffee  so it s easier on the machine  yes  the machine should be capable of performing as promised  but that s another review bottom line  this product is currently my ideal coffee  my ideal coffee,1,0
2482,i am not a beef stick fan  maybe this is a cultural thing  but i think they taste ghastly  dry  vinegary  sawdusty and salty  this was juicy  moist  with just a bit of snap for texture with a really tangy flavor thing going on  it is not the hot sauce kind of acrid vinegary spicy like so many beef sticks tend to be   i d describe the flavor as more a robust  full flavored  zest  with dominant elements of garlic and black pepper  i consider it more flavorful than spicy  but your mileage may vary it is about the size of the ostrim stick   gag  hate ostrim    each stick is about 93 calories with 8gm of protein  240mg of sodium  not the best but it is a beef stick   5 g of fat  and 4g of carbs  but this is not just the best tasting beef stick i have ever had  it is the  only  beef stick i would conceivably classify as tasty   i am not the only one who thinks so because if i buy a case with the intention of storing it as an emergency snack  even if i wait a day  my friends and family would have finished off everything  find a good hiding spot this is also a   er   pungent smelling snack  so don t whip it out during a date or anything  think slim jim is vile  try this ,1,0
2483,i love the taste  and the fact that it s sustainably caught  i m not sure about the impact of it being from vietnam  but i like the product  very flavorful tuna,1,0
26,i make a scratch choc  gluten free cake    this is almost as good   but of course much easier  very moist   don t know what happened to the lady with gritty  tex  and aftertaste   unless that comes when it gets old  this will not get old   it will be gone  wow,1,0
2485,high protein for so few calories    awesome  but this is not without the compromises you would expect  simply put  the taste isn t great and can be pretty dry  the later is pretty much remedied with a glass of water though   it tastes like unsweetened chocolate mostly  let me say that it s not terrible at all  i could tollerate it but a for a few more calories i m more than happy to get a bar that i don t have to  tolerate  at every bite  it s up to you then to decide what you want out of your protein bar  delivers on nutrition but not on flavor,1,0
2487,we have tried multiple chews and this is the best one we have found for our bouvier puppy  they do not smell and they provide many hours of chewing enjoyment  she also loves bully sticks but they smell horrible  even the ones that say they have no odor   we recently had our dog spayed and she chewed on her himalayan dog chew for days and did not bother her stitches at all  granted  these chews are expensive and do not last forever  so you may want to save them as a special treat  they can also break when your dog drops them on a hard surface  although they do not smell  you may find some little chips from the chew around the house  when they get too small  you will have to throw them away because your dog will continue chewing on them  in summary  we absolutely love these chews and our dog does  too  best chew toy,1,0
2488,this whole line of hair care seems to be adequate but not exceptional   at least of the four products i have tried   they have a mix of conventional and healthy ingredients   the conditioning is exceptional as far as getting rid of tangles   but it leaves my hair with a dull look   interestingly enough  i notice that my hair dries quickly with this line of hair products  i don t know what causes that   but i do enjoy that aspect of it   in short  i don t feel compelled to buy more but i m not sorry i tried it  pretty good ,1,0
2489,i can t count the number of conditioners that i ve tried and then thrown in the trash in an effort to give my fine hair some needed volume   this conditioner does do what it claims to do  volume without weight and it smells good i ll probably buy it again  however  i wish it came in a more friendly container   it is difficult for my arthritic hands to hold the 12 oz bottle which has an odd shape   the l oreal ever pure shampoo and conditioners are much  much easier to hold  good conditioner but poor packaging,1,0

2492,by the grace of god  unlike monster or almost any energy drink  including those horrifyingly disgusting and extraordinarily expensive shots of caffeine which carry the not so happy side effect of making you get hot flashes and flush like it s a freaking rash on your face   this actually tastes palatable  in my experience of tasting energy drinks and shots  they almost invariably taste exactly like toothpaste and or cough syrup  not only are they disgusting beyond words and are insanely unpleasant to drink for seemingly no good reason  but they almost always have very little of the single ingredient that matters  caffeine  any half educated energy drink consumer knows this is the only ingredient in the entire thing that actually does anything at all  there s 240mg per can in these  versus the usual 120mg  about the same amount of a standard cup of coffee  in other drinks of the same size  which is just not enough for people like me this stuff actually tastes like a genuine raspberry soda  has a decent kick  and doesn t taste as horrible as anything monster has ever made or any of the even more unpleasant energy shots that taste identical to concentrated cough syrup  which then  for seemingly almost everyone  give you a blast of niacin so insanely high that it even warns you of it ahead of time  and by god  if it lasted more than a few minutes  you d think you d need an ambulance  and you pay a  lot  for those suckers this is really the way to go  it tastes good and has a lot of caffeine  and lacks the bad things most energy drinks have  since that s really all that matters  i highly recommend it  it never seems to get old  doesn t taste like toothpaste or cough syrup  all right ,1,0
2493,the banana nut bread was much better then i thought   i would have never bought this in he store but trying it has changed my mind  really good,1,0
2494,the product i like very much  use it both as supplement and bath oil   the only problem i had w  my last order was it was not properly packaged and one of the bottles leaked   they are suppose to stay sealed then refrigerate once opened   this was disappointing  hemp oil,1,0
2495,folgers classic roast ground coffee  22 6 ounce packages  pack of 3 great coffee  however  way overpriced  i recently purchased the 33 9 ounce  pack of 6  for  47  free shipping through a different web site  my order arrived in 3 days  the only coffee used in my house,1,0
2496,seeing other reviews i decided to order some to see what all the fuss is about  while the product tastes a bit better and contains cane sugar instead of corn sweeteners like the grocery store brands i don t think that is worth the cost so more than likely i won t be ordering again  good but at a cost,1,0
2497,my dobie  max  is as picky a dog as i have ever owned when it comes to eating his meals  i have tried most highly rated dry and canned food brands   blue buffalo  wellness  taste of the wild etc  he refuses to eat any dry food unless i lace it with some chicken or beef or cheese to get him started  it is like priming a pump in that it takes just a small amount of what he considers a goodie to get him to usually finish his entire meal  sometimes i would put some canned dog food in with the dry but he woud rarely eat it and after it sat there a while i would have to throw it away  that was an expensive and wasteful way to go so i stopped when i received the chef michael s sirloin i placed a small amount in my hand and offered it to max  he went through his usual routine when offered something new by giving it the sniff test  throwing in on the floor to thoroughly examine it and then  if he likes it  scarfing it right up  he then gave me the old  gimme more  look but i did not fall for it  i cannot say with any certainty whether this product is healthy or  as some have declared  just plain junk food  i can say that max loves this stuff  i have no intention of giving this to him as a meal but rather as an occassional treat mixed in with his regular food  if i notice any adverse effects or if his poop is altered then i will discontinue its use  the bag says it is manufactured by purina and gives a us address but it is not clear if the address is just for the location of purina or whether the food is actually manufactured in the us  i doubt that the food is made in the us because other purina products and their web site are very careful to shield any source information  i am particularly careful on what i feed max because his predecessor died of poisoned food from china if this is junk food that is harmless when consumed in small amounts and not often then so be it  who among us can honestly say they never ate any junk food  i don t feel that my life has been ruined by an occassional journey into junk food land  neither my vet nor i believe any harm will come to max from giving him a treat every once in a while  max gives it a paws up,1,0
21,the cereal tastes like a cinnamon roll  without being too sugary   it stands up to milk and doesn t break down   the box is pretty skinny  so when it was mailed it was crushed somewhat  which made it hard to stand it up on the shelf  so that s a note to people who will buy this product to be shipped in the mail   other than that  i enjoyed it and might buy it in the store if i got a hankering for a frosted cereal  does taste like a cinnamon roll  but not as sugary,1,0
20,we ve been feeding this nutro max cat for a few years now   we started with the indoor adult roasted chicken and switched him to senior roasted chicken about a year or so ago   he likes both flavors and didn t seem to even notice when we switched but here s the real plus  we ran out of food and couldn t get to the pet store quickly enough  so i picked up a different  premium  brand at target when i was shopping for other items   while he went crazy for it  two things happened   first  he ate way too much   we ve been in the habit of just putting food in his bowl when it s empty and he was always good about restraining himself   that tells me the food is very tasty  but he s actually gained weight on it   the second thing is that his littler box smells awful on the other food   his urine is very strong  and cat urine really doesn t need any help in that department   and his poop smells terrible we are switching back to nutro max and we won t make the mistake of switching again  cat likes it and a more pleasant litter box ,1,0

2503,i m very surprised no one has written about these  yet   i never really thought much of dry roast almonds  they re either over roasted  or they re correctly roasted  but maisie jane s almonds are the smoothest i ve ever had   i m a typical buyer of trader joe s brand almonds  but three pounds of tj s costs around 21 bucks  so this is a better deal   however  the difference in taste and crunch makes maisie jane s a far better value   this is my brand  now   hands down  impressive above and beyond ,1,0
19,wow     not too salty   about half the size you would get otherwise     great taste  delivery was fast  i didn t experience any leaking issues as some of the other reviews mentioned  well packed  will buy again  one star off for size  wow     not too salty,1,0
2505,keurig has  for better or worse  pushed the coffee market in a strange direction   convenience is championed over quality   luckily  starbucks  house blend k cups are just as good as the bean versions of the coffee that you can purchase in stores   out of the blends that i have tried  the house blend seem to be the most balanced  it s not too acidic  not too bitter  not too bland   it s just right   i would recommend this coffee to both coffee novices and coffee experts with that said  i would recommend comparing prices off amazon before buying these here   the prices seem to fluctuate  as they do in other stores as well   one of the tastiest of the k cups,1,0
18,i m writing this review to provide other interested customers with a more realistic expectation than the other review listed with this product does    the first time i ve tried the tea forte green mango peach tea was via one of their silken infusers  i loved the flavor of it  i didn t even notice at that point that there was any mint included with it  when i received the loose leaf tea i ran into the same issue the other buyer did  the tea had a strong mint flavor overpowering almost all other flavors in this tea  i went ahead and used much less tea leafs  i have one of their 12oz kati tumblers and used just 1 tsp of tea leafs with that and only left the leafs in the hot water for a minute or two  with that i was able to get the desired flavor  i can see how someone  that hasn t used the silken infuser and therefore has no idea what this tea is supposed to taste like  would be disappointed with this product  if you use the method of brewing i ve described you barely taste any mint flavor and the mango and peach flavors come out as intended desired  you have to know the product to get it right ,1,0
2476,i put a bowl of this out next to our dog s other food  also purina brand   the dog clearly preferred this food and finished the entire bowl   i found the food odd looking    instead of typical little chunks of kibble  this food had pieces that look like meat  with scraggly edges and such   i have no idea if dogs care what their food looks like    but they did seem to enjoy eating this   i wish the bag had a zip lock closure  but other than that  no complaints  the dog loved it,1,0
2475,i love these bars and eat them every morning before the gym  i ordered them on the internet to try and save some money and i either got 2 packages of old bars or they were melted previously and then got hard again  the chocolate on the outside of the bar did not taste the same nor did the peanut butter on the inside  i am still giving it 5 stars because the normal taste of these bars is excellent but i am extremely disappointed by the 2 boxes i received by mail  i learned my lesson and will continue to buy them at wegmans where i have found they are actually the same price but they are always fresh  bad shipment,1,0
2474,love it  the flavor  hmm     i do not have the exact words to describe it  i like a strong flavor coffee  and this has a nice strong flavor  i also find green and herbal teas soothing  and the rooibos has that also  it s not coffee  and it s not tea  but it does have some of the characteristics of both  no caffiene  so when i want a coffee late in the afternoon or in the evening  then this is my go to drink if you re keurig machine has different size options  i usually go with the 10oz size  i found 12oz too weak  i never tried the smaller size options  so i do not know how strong it will be with the smaller sizes it does stain your cup  but  i once read that if it doesn t stain  then you re not drinking authentic rooibos tea i will buy again  k cup rooibos tea by twinings,1,0
32,the short version   these would probably be fine and palatable to a baby toddler   if you are looking for food for an older kid with eating issues food aversions texture issues etc    they are smooth as regular apple sauce  but the flavor made my son spit it out   i thought they tasted good  but i m not the one with the food aversions  or at least not the same ones      my son did eat plenty of green veggies as an infant that he won t touch now  even if pureed   so your mileage may vary our family regularly consumes more of these baby food  pouches  and fruit sauce  pouches  than i imagine most families who have an actual baby at the suggested  stage    my son has autism and has quite a few issues with eating so not only does something have to taste good  it has to be uniform in consistency  and it has to look and smell acceptable to him   he is 8 and he will eat baby food puree  earth s best in the little glass jars  that doesn t have any  gummable  chunks that older babies usually get   add in that we have g6pd deficiency and follow strict dietary rules and there are few  convenience  foods that are suited to our needs   my son adores the revolution foods pouches but will not touch home made apple sauce  even if hidden in reused baby food jars     some of the ella s kitchen pouches he adores and others he hated so much that he will go through the entire fridge shelf of pouches just to make sure none of those flavors have infiltrated   i was hoping that this baby gourmet simple puree juicy pear and garden greens pouch would be a great way to get some broccoli and other green goodies in his belly   they do have some added ascorbic acid  which is contraindicated in high doses for folks with g6pd deficiency  but i calculated the potential dose and for us  your mileage may vary and you should consult your pediatrician or hematologist about ascorbic acid and any other contraindicated substances  it was ok   my spouse joined us in the pouch taste test i think they taste good  like pear apple sauce with a hint of broccoli greens   it kind of reminded me of when my mom would serve us pork chops and potatoes  apple sauce  and spinach for dinner when i was a kid  sans the pork chops      my husband thought they were just as good as any of the other ones we have tried my kid took two slurps of it and ran to the toilet to spit it out   he declared that it tastes like the apple sauce went bad   i disagree  but as far as what purees come into our house  his opinion is very important   i think that if i diluted one of these with two regular apple sauces it might  dampen  the loudness of the veggies enough for him to eat it but i m not even sure about that   to me the green flavors weren t that  loud  but they definitely made this  not pearsauce applesauce blend      definitely not a  sneaky chef  sort of food for our family  but i ll probably try other flavors out as they are still an extra little boost of goodness for adults on the run  probably loved by babies   ,1,0
2445,my son loves these crackers  he started eating them around 7 months  i would break them into little pieces and put them in his mouth  now at almost 9 months  he feeds himself the whole cracker  my husband didn t like it at first that the product came from china  the dude is chinese   but then realize its a big known company so i guess he s ok with it now  more like he s not getting rid of this product cuz it s the only thing that will calm our baby down during his tantrum  anyhoo  love this stuff  don t care if they come from outer space ,1,0

41,i gave this product to my girlfriend to try since she has long  color treated hair when i first got this  a lot of the product was all over the plastic bag that it came in  be warned  they sent it in a padded envelope and the shampoo was everywhere from there  to me it has an interesting fragrance  nothing horrible  but nothing that i just have to use either  the first time i used it  i had to use a bunch of shampoo because i just couldn t get it to lather  after that  it was back to the normal amount to suds up my hair when i first used it  i noticed that my hair felt a little drier and stripped  this is something that i notice every time i use a different brand of shampoo which i thing is just the feeling of the built up old product getting washed off my hair  with repeated use  this feeling went away i also used the corresponding conditioner  within the first couple days  i noticed that my hair felt thicker and softer  the ends of my hair still have the remains of some bleaching and are drier than the rest of my hair  they felt smoother after a couple days of use the only negative thing i find is that my hair gets greasy faster with the use of this shampoo  the only thing i can think of is the extra nutrients that are supposed to help the scalp is just adding too much to my all ready normal scalp over all  this is not that bad of a product  i like how my hair feels softer and seems to have more volume without drying out the ends further  using the conditioner does help the ends too  more on that on the other review  but i do admit that i wouldn t get it again just because of how greasy my hair gets with it i think if you are looking for a product that will help your dry hair  this is one to look into shawn kovacichauthor and creator of numerous books and dvd s  it does a good job  but     ,1,0
40,i drink a lot of cappucino  so i decided to try this drink  it is only vaguely reminiscent of real cappucino  that said  it was rather tasty  a nice light drink  if you don t care much about true coffee flavor   and they do name this a  coffee drink    it might be worth a try  not cappucino  but not bad ,1,0
2450,my daughter was on nutramigen for her entire first year but not by my choice   she  unfortunately  was a victim of quacks and landed in the nicu for the first month of her life  her nicu stay wasn t much better because of some lazy nurses  and i can judge because i am a nurse myself  they were feeding her regular enfamil at first but switched her to nutramigen because of stomach  issues   the issue was they were stuffing her with about a cup of formula per feed 6 8 times a day   they actually distended her stomach  when she got home she could not tolerate any other formulas so i just stuck with nutramigen   sorry  just had to vent  anyway  i started out using the powder which was ok but i always had a problem with clumping and clogging the nipple which would then cause my daughter to scream at the bottle   aside from the inconvenience  it was only good for 24 hours   plus  in my research  i found out that almost all baby tragedies regarding any formula had to do with powders not liquids   yes  buying the liquid is more costly  but nutramigen is expensive anyway so what s a few more bucks especially when child safety is concerned   it was roughly an extra 2 bucks a day the liquids are pasteurized and good for 48 hours which is a big timesaver   i have used the 13oz concentrate liquid  32oz rtu can  2oz plastic nursettes  the 6oz glass nursettes  loved those  and the 8oz concentrate in plastic bottles more on those later   boo   when enfamil came out with these 8oz rtu bottles  i immediately bought them   the individual bottles are convenient and don t take up much room   they are all foil sealed  cap locked and boxed to protect from light   they have a fairly long shelf life so you can stock up  nb  if you order directly from enfamil  as i did  the expiration was always 3 6months from the purchase date  i can not speak for other vendors   when you do open them  you never have to worry about waste because of the small size   in the rare event that you do waste it s only a few ounces not an entire can   the 6 pack case was also helpful when i needed to leave some at grandma s house incidentally  a caution regarding the 8oz concentrate bottles   i purchased the concentrate bottles at the same time as the rtu  however i noticed that the concentrate formula had these gray black floaters in it which i never saw in other liquid versions of nutramigen   even after shaking well they still remained  i immediately called enfamil to express my concern and they sent me a new case  this case had the same problem so  out of curiosity  i mixed it up and tried it   although  it tasted and smelled like nutramigen  which is god awful btw  akin to asparagus and metal bathed in dirty feet  i was still concerned and did not give to my daughter  i asked them to replace the order with glass nursettes   in retrospect  my suspicion is that the floaters are iron particles that do not disperse well in the fat like oil and vinegar  and thus are harmless  however i would still be wary   it is possible that enfamil has addressed this issue since my purchase several months ago but i would stick to the ready to use formulas or 13oz concentrate cans  love the convenience  but not the cost  ,1,0
2451,i poured a line of the critter ridder along the exterior foundation of the horse barn   the feed room to discourage a daily raccoon visit  every night this raccoon trots in the barn like he owns it  rustles around the hay bales   water buckets and he leaves a clear track in the open  every single night without fail for months  this creature has made a visit  yesterday i poured the critter ridder and went home  this morning there were raccoon tracks outside the barn in the sand and some scratch marks in a couple of places where the stuff was sprinkled  but no tracks inside the barn  he did not cross it to come in  i don t know how long this will be effective  but this morning there were no vermin signs near the water faucet or buckets and that is a good thing  we ll have to see what happens over the long run and how often we have to reapply for continued results  this is a loose product  sort of like a jar of coarse ground black pepper   if you aren t careful  you can pour too much in one spot   not enough in the next spot  seems to repel the barn raccoon,1,0

39,i have been getting the skinny cappuccino pods for a few years now and with this recent purchase i was shocked at the price jump  it s actually more than what it costs on the dolce gusto website  and they have jumped in price too   i always count on amazon being well priced but unfortunately it s not the case with this product right now the skinny pods are ok but i m realizing i like the regular cappuccino pods better as i think they taste great without anything else added  especially since they are far less expensive   i had been able to justify  1 cup  even less with subscribe and save  for these pods but the skinny pods are climbing to more than i like so it s back to the regular cappuccinos for me all in all  i ve been very happy with the dolce gusto machine and cappuccinos for the past 3 years just not happy about the higher price  love the product  disappointed in price jump,1,0
2453,we ve been getting these biobags for quite a while as small trash can liners   in the beginning  they weren t very sturdy and came in a roll   when we tore them apart  even if we were careful  sometimes at least one of the two bags we were trying to separate would tear to the point that it couldn t be used   now the bags are much stronger and come separated i haven t used biobags for compost since they ve been stronger  so i don t know if they still break down as fast as they did  but in the past i ve used them in compost and seen them break down more quickly than some foods   it s a good idea to change the bag relatively frequently if you re using it for anything very moist   another note   messes involving vomit should not be placed into biobags  because apparently the stomach acid cuts right through them  resulting in an even worse mess i really love these bags and the improvements to them over time  these have improved a lot ,1,0
2456,it s great for what it is   a 15oz bowl of soup for only 100 calories i guess the other reviewers don t understand the purpose of a low calorie meal  90  water 10  vegetables   yes  the broth keeps the calorie content down  would you rather buy it if it were 10oz  minus 5oz of broth    tastes horrible    ick   it s 100 calories for 15oz of soup  you know what tastes good to humans  fat  sugar  salt  if you want that  go elsewhere and stop complaining healthy choice has a better tasting country vegetable soup also sold here  but it s double the calories  it s great for what it is   a 15oz bowl of soup for only 100 calories,1,0
38,i ll be the first to admit i m not picky about my hair care products  that being said  i used this conditioner before i cut my hair and my hair was noticeably softer and less inclined to get wild afterward when compared to many other low end conditioners  when i cut my hair from about 3 inches to 3 4 of an inch  however  i noticed no difference between this and a same bottle shampoo conditioner  so  if you have short hair  this won t make much difference  i also have fairly average hair density  so i can t speak for those with really thin or thick hair while this product is not geared toward a specific gender  i was a little dismayed to find out that they conditioner is scented  there s no such indication on the bottle   the scent is very noticeable and will last most of the day  and in both my and my girlfriend s opinion is not very suitable for most men  she described the scent as  perfume y   this scent was enough to make me not use the conditioner on days i left the house  better than most  but depends on the length of your hair,1,0
37,i was expecting this to be really salty  like most prepackaged food  but was pleasantly surprised  albeit not as surprised as my wife  who grew up in beijing and generally hates prepackaged food  or our friend from bangkok  along with the recommended beef  we added potatoes  veggies  sausage  and just a little sugar  and it tasted like homemade  our friend didn t even realize that it was packaged food until we showed him the box    he just assumed that my wife made it from scratch also  the small box made a pretty good amount of sauce  often times with these kinds of things  one or two people can easily finish off a package that claims to have 6 or 8 servings so they can water down the  nutrition  information  along with some rice  this made enough for three adults with one small serving left over the only negative is the leaves    there are a ton of them  i ended up chewing up and swallowing a lot of them just because it got to be a hassle picking around them  i would have preferred fewer  larger pieces  i wouldn t want to change the taste  though  it s a bit expensive  too  but considering how much food it makes  despite the small box   it s not too bad  hard to believe this is pre packaged food  and my chinese wife and thai friend agree,1,0
17,i ordered this popping corn after being disappointed with the local big box store selection two brands   one of them tasted chalky like styrofoam and its claim was larger popped kernels   no taste i mainly use this popcorn with one of those plastic microwave popping bowls   i noticed that 1 3 cup yields more cooked popcorn than two other brands i have tried   it kept on popping after my usual 2 minute and 20 second routine   when using microwave poppers  you tend to get some burnt kernels if you extend the cooking time for maximum popped corn   the snappy burnt kernels didn t taste as bad as other brands this white popcorn tasted great with canola oil and even better when popped with coconut oil  works great with microwave popper,1,0

2460,    when my six year old  seventy pound dog  pheyeg hdeaux  hears me opening his usual bag of eukanuba he does wander over after a while and watch me till i ve dumped several pounds into his giant feeding tub  and then he does typically aimlessly meander over to it and sniff it and eat some   i think he s just checking to make sure i haven t added a live squirrel or a robin  both of which he s 100  sure he can catch out in the wild if he tries just a little bit harder  which he always does but which never quite works but shortly after i opened the bag of this product  chef michael s grilled sirloin dry dog food 4 5 pound bag  pheyeg hdeaux not only ran to the kitchen  he actively sniffed up a veritable storm as i walked a few steps here and a few steps there preparing to present him with the food that so tickled his extraordinarily sensitive olfactory palate   he snarfed  if i m using that term correctly  down several bites more than he would snarf up of eukanuba  which tells me there s something special about this dog food   i think    and i admit i m just guessing here    that the purina people have somehow managed to synthesize a special molecule or compound whose only purpose is to appeal to a dog s taste buds and smell neurons  and they ve added it to the product under review   if your dog is a picky eater  this might be a good choice in any case it s important to consider not only taste and texture but healthfulness   in order to test the nutritional value of chef michael s grilled sirloin dry dog food 4 5 pound bag i myself went ahead and ate it exclusively for three days  and now that i m conscious again i can report the results first  second and third  it tastes awful   i realize it might taste really good to a dog  especially if that dog usually eats eukauba  but see my review of june 7  2012  of purina beneful original dog food  15 5 pound  for years at a time with only the rarest of desserts of bunny carcass or cat poop  but as a human i can tell you here and now  without any doubt  that this product tastes awful not just after a few days  not just after a few bites  but after a few chews of the first bite   there are different shaped bits and they are different colors  but no matter which bit you choose it will turn out to be dreadful shortly after you bite into it   you try the first bit and it s nasty from the first chew to the last swallow   hopefully you try a second shape of bit  but it turns out to be even worse   still hopefully  you try a third shape or a different color  and it proves to be yet even more dreadfully awful tasting as i say  i ate nothing but chef michael s grilled sirloin dry dog food 4 5 pound bag for three days  and at this time i also wish to report that my bone marrow has turned green  which the many doctors who ve attended to me since this morning when i had to take myself to the emergency room because of several unusual and quite alarming alarming symptoms say is not just uncommom but downright unprecedented   also  they say my blood tests indicate i m pregnant  which is a whole new problem since  as you know from previous amazon reviews  i m still a virgin   i ll keep you updated  because i think we might have something here     i subtract one star because the bag is not nearly as handy as the beneful one   it s not as tough  and it has no opener or closer in case you didn t click to read my review at http   www amazon com review r1bese8r6uu51i ref cm cr pr perm ie utf8 asin b001vj0b0i nodeid  tag  linkcode of the beneful product  you probably should if you re ever going to get another dog or cat   go to the section titled ad lib feeding   also  note that i have updated the list from seven pets to eight  green marrow  not bag  irrelevant,1,0

2462,this korintje cinnamon tastes much more vibrant and has the sharp sting of cinnamon  similar to big red  chewing gum   this type of cinnamon would be great for desserts  such as the korean soo chung gwa  cinnamon drink   but i would not recommend it for non bakery foods  because it is so fragrant with a sharp cinnamon sting  i think that using it in sauces for meats might make it too overpowering  it is excellent for bakeries and cinnamon rolls though i also made some gingerbread cake and the korintje cinnamon is what made mine tastes just like the whole foods market s famous gingerbread sold at their bakeries  when compared to mccormick s cinnamon  i could taste a significant difference  mccormick s tastes more flat and dull  which may be good for meat or recipes where you want only a light cinnamon flavor  like pho   frontier s korintje cinnamon tastes sharp and stingy  with a strong fragrance  definitely high quality cinnamon,1,0
35,yes  stone me now  i ve removed a star  and not due to the quality of the product but  this is a packaged deal  and as you can t get one without the other  there you have it the dogs loved the bones  and it does take them a few minutes to get through them  which is the point good ingredients  and no staining however  why these come packaged in such a heavy box  wasting recourses  is beyond me the bag they are in is sturdy  air tight  and could easily be sold on it s own there are over treats  checkup  that arrive this way  so clearly it can be done unlike the makers of greenies who never bothered to respond to the same question about packaging  the kind folks are nylabone did until these is lest waste in the way these are packaged  i m gonna have to pass of purchasing more   sorry puppies  product is good  packaging   ,1,0
2464,the first quaker stila blueberry cookie bar that i ate was a disappointment   there seemed to be very little filling  which caused a lack of flavor   however  every bar after that was tasty and filled appropriately   the crust has a subtle sweetness to it  while the blueberry compliments it very well   i would certainly buy more of these in the future because they are a nice snack that is not loaded with calories  flaky crust and flavorful,1,0
2466,i wanted to nurse my daughter for a full year  but i had supply problems from the start  i managed to keep at it for 7 months  but i had no choice but to go to formula  earth s best made it easier for me to make the transition to formula feeding  i was so grateful that it didn t have brown rice syrup in it  which was found to have high levels of arsenic   and it didn t upset my baby s tummy  i guess it tasted fine  because she took right to it i almost went with similac organic because of name recognition  but then i read about them using organic cane juice  which makes it sweeter than other formulas  forget that  i m glad i looked into what was going into the formula  no organic brown rice syrup ,1,0

2470,the product description says  item weight  1 pounds    however  this is 7 oz  of candy   i could have bought this across the street from my house for less money for 16 oz  of mints this would have been a good deal  as it is  it was just a waste of time and money i now understand why consumercrafts has a legal disclaimer on the product page   caveat emptor update the vendor corrected the weight on the page and removed the ambiguity the mints themselves are fine i was told that the legal disclaimer was related to certain food items sold by count  although i had never seen this before i appreciate that they made it right  check the weight  please  issue corrected by the vendor ,1,0

34,i read all the previous reviews about the taste and do not agree  i like these  i don t care for overly sweet treats  the bars i bought from whole foods were not hard or with open wrappers unlike other reviewers stated  my 3 year old just picks the chocolate chips out and eats them leaving most the of the bar untouched which i finish off  at this age she prefers annie s cookie grahams over these  previously we tried envirokids organic krispy rice chocolate bars which she didn t like but i loved however all the recent reports of lead levels in rice concerned me  so we were happy to see these from annie s  i think if parents want a big gooey sweet snack for their children they should look elsewhere and then maybe reevaluate what they are feeding their kids in the first place  tasty  organic and perfect for on the go ,1,0
33,my husband will not make more of an effort to feed himself than to heat something up and if i m not around to provide for him or leave him something already made in the fridge  his immediate go to is canned soups and canned pastas  as such  i thought these hormel meals would be a brilliant thing to have around the house  not only are they right up his alley with being extremely easy to prepare but there is a very wide variety  they come in their own bowl  and you don t need to refrigerate them  i had visions of him keeping a stash at work or in his car and never having to buy lunch if he forgot it at home  or even him grabbing one for a late night snack and being pleased that he had so many different kinds to choose from well  he quickly killed that after trying about four of them  he now will only eat them as a last resort  he s really not all that fond of them  which leaves me to eat them seeing as how we have so many in the house the chicken breast and dressing is one of the better ones of the hormel line but it does have its faults  the gravy is too salty like many of hormel s products  the dressing  though  is good and filling and i actually prefer it over the potatoes you can find in many of the red meat meals  i m not normally a fan of celery but the occasional crisp it adds to the dressing is very welcome  the texture gives what would otherwise be a pretty mushy meal  a tiny bit of contrast  the chicken in this is one of hormel s better meats  mostly because i feel like i m actually eating meat  which unfortunately isn t always the case with hormel   i would say that the gravy would be much better with way less salt but i m afraid if you took the salt away  the flavor would just be a bland  blah bore for what this is    a non perishable prepared food that is fairly cheap    it s pretty good  it will fill you up quickly at very low effort and cost  but if you are going to compare it to something you can make yourself  well  there really isn t any comparison all i know is that if the end of the world were to come  we have so many of these that we would be set for some while  well  as long as the end of the world didn t mean the end of working microwaves  that is    salty but filling,1,0
2459,i have spent a ridiculous amout of money trying to get my 2 new dogs to eat   i tried the major brands and the expensive brands  researched the internet for recommendations  wet dry you name it   i was always faced with the few sniffs and then the look up at me in bitter disappointment  i never was a dog person but these two were dumped by me so i took them in  the vet said they looked like at one time they had been pound dogs because of spaying tatoos   i felt sorry for them and would give them table scraps   big mistake   i also used treats for housebreaking  they had a feeder which contained what was described in research of consumer reports as a  guarantee your dog would love  that they would walk over to and sniff and walk away  i put the bingo mega in there and now they are excited when i give them their dish  my neighbors are going to be very disappointed that their dogs will no longer be receiving the bags  cans and treats my dogs refused  if you have a picky eater  problem solved,1,0

2507,i have tasted most of all of the coconut water on the market   this is the best   it does not have the aftertaste that some have and does not taste stale   i recommend the one in the green can  not in the glass bottle   for some reason the glass bottle real coconut water with pulp does not taste the same and does not taste as fresh   if you like this coconut water  amazon is the way to go  best deal even compared to whole foods 10  discount on the case   strongly recommend to try this product   taste nirvana real coconut water with pulp  16 2 ounce  pack of 12  the best coconut water on the market ,1,0
2508,i just got a bottle of this as a gift from a dear friend    really  most sauces i use are no more than 3000 scoville units if that much   this is way hotter    one source on line claims 1 2 million units but i am skeptical   still  the few drops i ve had  one at a time  strike me as quite flavorful apart from the heat   if you can stand this level of burn  at least this sauce is providing something other than burn i suspect that i ll use most of this in cooking homemade soups as a source of heat  where its good flavor will be diluted too much to matter    rather a pity  flavorful for something this hot,1,0
2541,because i treat my hair so horribly  i am always pulling it back    i was hoping this would improve the look of my ends    especially since i am also horrible when it comes to making regular haircut appointments    but when i use this on my ends at the end of my shower  it does seem to make a difference   and it smells great   not too strong  just a pleasant  warm kind of smell the directions suggest that you can use it on dry hair as well   but the one time i tried that   my hair looked like a greasy mess   so i will continue to use it after a shower and hope that it keeps making up for my neglect  smells fabulous ,1,0
2542,i just bought 2 jars of the leroux chicory   as above   years ago i drove thu  louisiana  and noticed the coffee tasted  different   chicory   so i know what chicory tastes like this product is not chicory     it looks and tastes like the pero  product  which i already have  did not want more of it  ed        e    bjerk cox neti need to change my opinion  just bought some ground chicory and  it tasted about the same  very good   perhaps i  am remembering the chicory flavor from many years ago as much stonger than  it really is  i must appologize for my initial opinion ed   chicory     ,1,0

2544,ordered from martha and have been very pleased with the bush  it came bare root in march just as it was beginning to bud out  didn t do so hot here in maryland in march  the buds died  however  the bush began growing again in april and flowered this year  two of the flowers have since turned into pomegranates about the size of apricots  i don t know if they ll ripen or not by october  when it starts getting cold  but i was amazed it set fruit so soon  i ve heard from professionals that pomegranates do not fair well in humidity  we have a ton   this bush seems to be an exception  we ll see  happy,1,0

2546,so  i wish i had found this stuff at least 15 years ago it smells like cookies and it works if you apply it 3 times a day  it doesn t say how many times to apply  but i ve been using it a lot i ve been cursed with baggage under my eyes thanks to my mothers side of the family and have used different organic methods to rid of them for years but have not had any real success until now   this cream seems to actually deflated the puffiness  what seemed impossible now looks possible  we ll see tho   i got this about 3 weeks ago  i ll update again in another 3 weeks  genetically puffy eyes suck   but this stuff works,1,0
2547,as other reviewers have pointed out  the effects vary from person to person  each tablet seemed to last up to a half hour  longer for my sister and while it did make things noticeably sweeter  the initial taste of something was identical  and it slowly got sweeter after the first half a second  oh  and sour bitter drinks like monster took on a sickly sweet syrupy flavor that may leave you feeling a bit ill after  don t try apple cider vinegar  it tastes fine if a bit odd on your tongue  but as soon as it hits your throat the flavor and fumes were overpoweringly awful  it works  but not as expected ,1,0

2550,i ve been drinking 2 cups a day for several months   i just read the description above and i can say i have not lost 1 ounce drinking this coffee   well  nor have i lost anything on a low carb diet  i just like the food better  but that s neither here nor there     anyway  this coffee does have a different taste due to the herbs spices but i happen to like it   i just drink it black in the morning   it wouldn t hurt to try it but don t expect any weight loss unless you combine it with healthy eating and exercise  of course  i like the taste ,1,0
8,this coffee drink has a much stronger coffee taste than most    and i like that   i don t drink a lot of coffee products  but when i do i want something that is definitely coffee and not a confusing combination of flavors and sweeteners   in addition to the strong coffee taste  there is a hint of bitterness but it s not unpleasant   this is not a beverage i would drink daily    i think it would lose some of its excitement and get a bit boring    but it s nice to have a few cans in the refrigerator   by the way  i tried heating a serving    don t bother  this drink is absolutely at its best served well chilled  strong coffee taste,1,0
2552,i got this sample a little over a week ago  and i have to admit at first i was unimpressed   it looked like a very small bottle of olive oil  my daughter even asked me why cooking oil was in the bathroom  assuming that i was making some sort of homemade beauty product  she s mistaking me for my mother  who thinks all the best beauty products are made in the kitchen  i m the one who thinks the kitchen is best for making food i had just about decided that this little bottle of oil wasn t for me  until i came in last night  our pool is wonderful  but the chemicals are murder on my hair  after washing and using my usual conditioner  my hair resembled some sort of witch s broom instead of straight hair down my back  with a tiny bit of hope  i picked up the bottle and decided to give it a try   i put three tiny drops on my palm  rubbed my hands together  and began applying it to my hair from the frizzy bottoms on up my bottle had no directions  which is the sole reason why i gave it four stars instead of five  the product is terrific  but i guessing how to use it isn t  the name of the product says  scalp   hair oil   and i only applied it to my hair  because my scalp makes enough oil on its own  guesstimating  i used 80  of the product on my hair from the shoulders down  since that s the part that s damaged and dry  i then styled my hair as usual wow  what a difference  my hair looks healthy  unfrizzy and perfect all the way down   that tiny amount of product made the abused part of my hair looks glossy  and as if it had no split ends or damage at all  it didn t look oily or messy at all  which was my fear when the family was calling it  cooking oil   in the interest of making a total disclaimer  i do not use heat on my hair at all  no blow dryer  no straightener  nothing  my hair is naturally straight  and i think that blow dryers hurt very long hair  so i always air dry it  the damage to the bottom half of my hair came from a misguided effort to put in highlights  when the stylist took a phone call and left the chemicals on for far  far longer than necessary  i looked rather like a skunk when the chemicals were finally rinsed off  i ve been cutting off the damage as my hair grows  but it takes time happiness abounds  i don t have skunky  scruffy  damaged hair  and i don t have an oily mess  either  the package dispenses the product by the drop  so this should last me a very long time  even if i use it daily  no matter   i am impressed enough with the results that i d go out and buy some right away   hmm  i should buy some for my mother and let her see how much better it is to use than kitchen products         gorgeous  glossy  glamorous tresses ,1,0

2540,if you have tried melinda s habanero sauces before  or marie sharps forcomparison  and you like the flavor and consistency  but need more heat then this is just for you i agree with mrs  h  this sauce will not blow the top of your head off melinda s advertising is somewhat misleading  as this sauce is listed at577 000 scovilles  its not  the lower scale of melinda s habanero selectionsare i e  xxx  xxxx reserve  etc  are separated by degrees of heat  no doubtthis is the hottest of the habanero family  but i d hazard to guess this isno more than 50 000 scovilles  although i m not doubting the savinas weretested and certified at 577k when i mention the recipe  i mean this    ingredients  red savina peppers hand selected choice red habanero peppers  fresh carrots  onions  lime juice vinegar  garlic  and salt  the vinegar is not noticeable  but in classicmelinda s fashion you get a pulpy carrot citrus based blast of pure heat thatwill satisfy most chiliheads now i m not saying this stuff is not hot  it sneaks up on you  and just asyou re noticing the mellow flavor of carrots with a lime juice underscore you may suddenly realize that the back of your mouth is on fire  but it wontleave any scar tissue or ruin your evening  so as you move up the heat scale don t pass this sauce by  its terrific on anything  and do yourself a favor and remove that little stopper dropper so you can get a liberal dose 5 scovies  follows melinda s basic winning recipe ,1,0
7,this conditioner worked well on my long  thick hair  i am using it along with a non sulfate shampoo and have no problems with it  it is pretty thick  so you don t need to use too much  my hair comes out soft with few tangles  the bottle is smartly designed with the product coming out of the bottom  the bottle does not leak or get clogged i took one star off because i am not that fond of the scent  also  i wish the ingredients were easier to read  they were located in the back of a peel off label and printed backwards  made my hair soft,1,0

2557,the concept of an all in one shampoo and conditioner is appealing although previously  i found suchproducts lacking   this shampoo is designed for men is there really a difference between male and female scalps   and is reputed to address both dandruff and dry scalp  five of us tried it  three men and two women   all of us liked the fresh  clean scent  our hair was clean and soft although i personally would have preferred more conditioning   my brother was most impressed as he spends alot of time outdoors and suffers from dry scalp   he appreciated the time saving element of the two in one and thought it worked as well as head n shoulders   the consensus was that this is a good product although not necessarily better than any other that is out there   my brother prides himself on being a savvy shopper and generally buys whatever is least expensive  this is certainly a product he would buy but not one he would go out of his way for  smells great  works well,1,0

3,when i came across this amish country popcorn i thought  well why not have some fun and diversity for a change  ol  orville looks like a fun loving guy  so he would agree i m sure  heck  he is probably living in malibu  floating in his horizon pool with his companion bonita   started out with the smallest variety  the ladyfinger  tiny yellow kernels pop into tiny tender popcorns  hardly a hull  nothing sticks in your teeth  harder to eat because of the small size  cute and delicious  little kids would like this  cooked just for them next was the baby white  these barely yellow kernels are sort of medium size and like the ladyfinger variety have little in the way of hulls and are very tender  a quality choice and easier to eat because it pops up larger  probably more like popcorn from the old days lastly  the purple  most seem to like this the best  full size and easy to eat  again  not too much in the way of hulls  the kernels are purple and they pop to white with purple flecks  attractive and full size  easy to eat  nice sort of nutty taste  although popcorn is pretty mild stuff no matter what brand you get i used a whirly pop  a device i recommend  coat the bottom with olive oil  almost cover the bottom with seeds  turn the heat up to around medium  not too low  and slowly turn the crank  stop when the popping stops  as it does pretty abruptly  and pour it into a bowl  i season with sea salt and ground pepper  for the butter part  i mix about a small spoonfull of real butter with a slug or three of olive oil  heated together in the micro  definite butter flavor without all the fat  not a bad compromise at all all varieties popped almost completely  not many duds this makes a great breakfast  takes just a few minutes this popcorn is advertised as from amish country and presumably is more a traditional style of corn  maybe a heritage variety  not a genetically modified product like orville s  this is a controversial subject  important to many people and this product is an alternative to  corporate popcorn  for them  popcorn should be fun,1,0

2,the smell in the single serve package is a little off putting  but i suspect that that s because it is actually the smell of good  organic coffee  even brewing  the smell is a bit sharp  but that first cup is   wow   i was shocked drinking it  actually  the flavor was not too terribly robust  but not so weak as to be merely coffee flavored water  indeed  the flavor is one which is almost minty  but not overbearingly so  i love my dark  robust coffee  the dark the better  in the mornings when i would rather climb under the bed  this coffee  however  seems to be one that i can drink with just about anything thing  at any time as a matter of fact  i m going to have other cup now if you are looking for a fair trade  organic coffee that doesn t taste like it  but will add flavor to your morning without tons of sugar and non dairy dairy creamer  this is a coffee i could drink without that stuff good stuff  wow,1,0

6,after doing a ton of research and reading about civet coffee  i finally broke down and purchased this for my birthday  just to give it a shot  at first  i was not impressed  thinking that i just overpaid for some upgraded folgers  but then i figured it out  the secret to this coffee is making it in smaller batches  at first i was making 4 5 cups at a time in my small coffee pot  then i cut that back to a two cup using approx  3 tablespoons of freshly ground coffee  it was amazing    the depth and natural sweetness of this coffee were unbelievable  definitely something worth trying at least once  i for one will be looking forward to the next time i can justify purchasing this special occasion coffee    another item off the  bucket list ,1,0

9,even though i hate sugar in any coffee beverage  this is pretty good  at 45 calories a can  there are probably 3 teaspoons of sugar  that s kinda hefty  but it doesn t taste that sweet  while it has a pretty strong flavor  it certainly doesn t have the robust  fresh ground flavor one may expect from illy  and  it tastes like it s been sitting in a can  because it has  maybe  they ll ship in glass and solve the metal aftertaste issue  not too bad for a can,1,0

2513,while identified as pure cherry extract  the label states the ingredients to be  cherry extract  alcohol  and water   since it appears other extracts commonly contain alcohol and water  i can live with these additional ingredients as a compositional reality for extracts disappointingly  however  the label does not state the percentages of each ingredient   for some extracts  the fda specifies certain minimum percentages and or weight to volume requirements be met for them to be marketed as an extract   required or not for cherry extracts  i would like olive nation jr mushrooms to provide this additional transparency on its ingredients label finally  i purchased this cherry extract to be used  in combination with the liquid form of carlsons  very finest  fish oil  as a supplement for various medical conditions   while it s too early for me to assess any personal medical benefits of this extract  i can state it tastes a bit like cherry cough syrup   lacking any other opinions for now  i decided to rate this product 4 stars  and hope more reviewers start weighing in for a broader based rating and overview  how pure is this extract to volume ,1,0

2515,i drink all kinds of energy drinks and shots  and when i found this on my store shelf i knew i had to try it i love the packaging and name of this stuff  referring to it affectionately as demon blood  i can imagine using this stuff for my demonic practices and rituals the drink has a blood red color  and actually doesn t taste half bad  beware  though  it tastes somewhat like cherry cough syrup  and has a similar consistancy as well  i like the taste of cough syrup  so this didn t really bother me much i have a few gripes with this drink  however  keep in mind that these are 4 oz bottles  so they are twice the size of normal energy shots or 1 4 the size of regular energy drinks  the 666 energy drinks use real sugar  which i applaud  but unfortunately they have about half the calories of a 16 oz can of nos or monster  drinking one of these is like drinking a can of soda  there is just a lot of sugar in this stuff so for about a soda s worth of sugar  what energy are you getting 200 mg of caffeine20 mg of vitamin b3  100 20 mg of b6  1000 250 mg of b12  4166 drinking one of the cheap  1 energy shots at the dollar store will probably give you a better boost than this  and they are sugar free i m at the point now where i would have to drink at least 2 of these to get going  but at that point  why not just buy a can of nos the 666 energy drink company does have a sugar free version  a decent fake lemonade flavor with the same nutritional value i found them at a discount retailer  ollie s  with a few misprints  they originally were selling them for  89 cents a piece  but clearanced most of them out for  2 00 per case  there are a lot of older and religious people where i live  haha   i wouldn t pay anymore than  1 00 per bottle in summary  these are alright tasting and will give energy drink junkies a mild boost  the main draw of these is the name and look of the drink  no other energy drink out there can rightfully be called demon blood  demon blood,1,0
15,i received some reusable k cups with this item that i am still using   i think i would have thrown away by keurig brewer it not for this purchase  good deal at the time,1,0
2516,got this recently   normally i would use head and shoulders  but i thought i would try a change in shampoo   glad i did   we all know head and shoulders works  but it has always smelled weird    like a hospital area   well the clear men scalp therapy works just as well and it smells nice too       much better than head and shoulders i am going to switch to this shampoo conditioner from now on   i just flat out like it   i am still an old guy  but my hair looks and feels better  fresh smelling,1,0
2517,i originally ordered these two flavors of peanut butter due to a recommendation from an email that i receive several times a week   i really like the chocolate flavor because it is really creamy when you mix it with the water and not overly sweet   it is very satisfying and i don t even use jelly with it   the peanut butter flavored one was just ok which is why i only gave it four stars   the chocolate one would have gotten five stars and i have already reordered it two more times  go for the chocolate ,1,0
2518,i realize that packaging and shipping shouldn t really be part of the product review  but i have to point out that this product really didn t ship well   it was sealed in a plastic bag  taped shut  and wrapped tightly in a cardboard mailer similar to the mailers for a paperback book   the result was a disaster   i could smell the fragrance when i opened my mailbox   it smelled awesome  but that s not what my mailbox is supposed to smell like when i opened the package  it was a big yucky bag of goo   a lot of the product had seeped out into the plastic bag   i washed it off  but the lid and cap had also been damaged  so it leeks if i just squeeze the bottle   that s a shame  because the bottle is designed to rest upside down  which is normally a nice feature for a product like this  it helps get the most product out of the bottle  so what about the product itself   it smells good   it s a clean fragrance that s fine for me or my wife   as expected for a conditioner  it helps reduce tangles and keeps my scalp from drying out i like this conditioner  but i m not convinced that it s the best online purchase  gee  your mail smells terrific ,1,0
2519,i read many of the reviews of this product before purchasing   i have to agree with many of the other reviews   the product did come in a brown bag  which i felt was a little haphazard  but ultimately ended up being okay  none of the coffees were damaged or anything    more importantly  there were only a few duplicates  but there were several coffees from the same company brand but with different roasts flavors   i would guess that out of the 30 something coffees sent  15 were the same brand   although  it was nice to see how this one company brand has many different roasts flavors  i really would have preferred to get a much wider perspective on many different brands and roasts   however  for the most part  i was fairly satisfied   when i am wanting a variety of different coffees  i will try this product once more  decent variety ,1,0

2522,the reviews about beneful dry dog food formula generally are negative  focusing on ingredients   animal health  there are also a number of negative side effects reported  you can find this information if you have google fu  that said  i am not a nutritionist or a scientist or a veterinarian  and i won t pretend to be   won t comment on those aspects  however  i can comment on how the dogs reacted to this food they loved it  there were no food allergies or reactions as others have reported  the food bits were about the same size as other food products on the market  so this formula might not be ideal for smaller dogs  average sized bits that the dogs just loved,1,0
2538,this is our number one choice for coffee    no brand currently even comes close   it s better than dunkin  donuts  better than archer farms  better than green mountain    better than a lot of coffees that are much more expensive  peet s  starbucks    it s buttery and smooth   it is not bitter  acidic or burnt tasting i hope target never stops carrying this brand and flavor    by the way  the french vanilla is much better than their hazelnut roast    i had never even heard of this brand before i saw it at target  the best flavored coffee    no competition ,1,0
2523,the flavor and fragrance are still there  and really nice too  the price is very decent  i have seen for myself how shade grown coffee production truly protects thousands of birds and other forms of wildlife  and how the newer full sun coffee bushes cause wildlife to die from lack of shelter and food  this is a clear cut case of your dollar paying to either support or destroy wildlife  buy shade grown  huge difference  decaf that does not taste like decaf  and protects birds too ,1,0
13,a glass bottle would have been better  it looked like glass in the photo  i didn t pay close enough attention  i usually avoid plastic amap especially after going to the expense of buying organic  i do not use molasses that much so i am not a good judge of the quality   i figure organic is the safest way to go   i use it mostly to make brown sugar  regular sugar   molasses   brown sugar     i don t even mix it  just put both in my recipe    careful  a little goes a long ways   almost,1,0
2525,i received a good variety of coffees  a handful of tea  a couple of hot cocoas and one apple cider  i was hoping for more tea selection and was actually shorted by three pods  not really a disappointment  however  i contacted customer service and they were awesome in how they handled the problem  in less than 12 hrs i received a reply with a gracious apology  a more than fair refund for the problem and missing items and an offer for express shipping on a reorder of the same variety pak  mind you this was amazon that replied on behalf of the seller  so the kudos go to amazon   variety is good   ,1,0
2526,the only thing i really liked soft drinks for was the carbonation  but a few sips and they were just too sweet to quench the thirst   like drinking a candy bar  and the diet drinks with the fake sugar left odd after tastes   so i tried this talking rain   no sweetener  no color  just a hint of flavor   there s very little taste  so be prepared for that  if i want an ice cream float  the carbonation provides the fizz and the only sugar i get is from the ice cream   i also like the screw top cap which lets me keep a bottle to go back to in the fridge  if you close it tightly it will keep the fizz for a couple of days   i keep the case stored in the basement where temperatures stay even   i wouldn t store it in a garage or any warm place  i also like the fact that it s manufactured in the usa   don t want the french or italian carbonated water   the same company also puts out a drink called ice  but i don t care for the more intense flavor    sort of like a fruity fresca   so give the clear talking rain a try  talking rain sparkling water,1,0
2527,although the product says its formula is proprietary  it leans heavily on red and black pepper  i have used these same ingredients to keep cats  off the porch  and squirrels  off the birdhouses  away  i have discovered that  like this  it is sometimes effective  most animals do not like pepper and will learn to stay away  however  there are some  not many  who do not have the aversion the one thing i particularly like about this product is that the granular shaker bottle makes it easy to spread the product as well as store it  it s much cheaper to buy red and black pepper  but this is definitely a more convenient solution  hit or miss,1,0
2528,i have heard that there were some problems with the older model of this device due to defective drive shaft  gray color    the good news is that the one i purchased is the new model with the orange colored drive shaft   i ve used it for a few months now and would say that it works well and is incredibly easy to use  so far  no issue with leakage and i know not to put the drive shaft in the dishwasher  although all the other parts can go in there    i love the ability to steam and puree food all in one step so making baby food doesn t get any easier than this  the newer model  orange drive shaft  works really well ,1,0
11,i was very excited to receive this item so quickly   i was imagining that this plant would already be planted but it wasn t   i am so glad that none of the traps broke when i planted them   the only concern that i have is one of the plants traps was completely black all the way to the roots   i just hope that none of the other plants turn black too   also some of the traps are not as green as the others but maybe they are supposed to have a reddish tint to them   also all the traps from the roots to half way up to the stems are yellow   i am not sure if i should be concerned about this either   other then that i am very happy with the plants i received and i can t wait to see if they grow bigger and have babies i can give to friends and family  3 small venus flytraps 3 inch pot,1,0
2529,i bought this before finding out about how it is manufactured  using hexane   i need to do a bit more research before i decide whether or not i d repurchase  that said  i really like the product itself  it is incredibly cheap  1 cup dried tvp   1 cup boiling water or broth   about 3 4 pound  and has a slightly chewy texture that is reminiscent of meat  in my opinion  it really absorbs the flavor of whatever you cook it in  unlike tofu  which can be terribly bland if not marinaded  as a vegetarian  i like the versatility this affords me  basically any recipe that calls for ground meat can be made using an equal weight of hydrated tvp  i made sloppy joes with it the night it arrived  and hardly missed the meat  veggie burgers  vegan chili  meatless bolognese  etc   are other good options  i have read that some eat it as sort of a breakfast porridge  and i can see how it would work  since the product itself is fairly flavorless   but i stuck with savory options  good  cheap  but   ,1,0
2530, i received a free bar to review through influenster s voxbox program  when i received my complimentary bar  i was too hungry to warm half of it up and thus compare the quaker soft baked banana nut bar heated up and not   but it tasted fine room temperature   in fact  it tasted just like banana nut bread   it was a touch dry  but no more than other cereal bars   at 3 29 for a box of five  standard retail price   the bars seem a touch price to me but are probably good for someone needing a quick  filling snack   the bars are a good source of b vitamins  which can be hard to incorporate into your diet what is there to say about a cereal bar  really   if this sounds like something you d enjoy eating  it probably is   if you hate bananas  then don t eat it  tastes exactly like banana nut bread,1,0
2531,i love cranberry apple crystal light   there are a few other flavors that i tolerate  but the cranberry apple i can drink day in and day out   i do mix mine weak  i make about 3 quarts out of a 2 quart pack  but that is how i like it  and i get more for my money   but the price has tripled in the last 4 months   how can that be   i will not be buying any more crystal light for over  9 per canister  that is just silly   kraft  stop messing with the flavors and keep supplying what customers want  what is with these prices ,1,0
2532,if you started experimenting first with the  keurig my k cup   as i did  but eventually moved on to  k caps   here s a way to stop your k caps from leaking  remove the black plastic cup holder from your keurig and replace it with the grey plastic base that came with the keurig my k cup  don t use the mesh basket or the grey lid  just the base portion   now use your recycled cups with k cap lids  you don t have to worry about aligning the holes and the grey base will hold the k cup a little higher so that you get a better seal around the top also  after cleaning your k cups  puff a little air through the bottom hole  the filter will invert  like a mushroom  and will dry much faster  this is also a good test of the filter   if it has a rip or tear in it  it will not fully form the mushroom shape   time to throw it away  stop leaking k caps  ,1,0
2533,its not too often that people take the time out to write a review about a healthy snack bar  this was so yummy and didnt taste bland at all  i was expecting it to taste weird  not be very filling but low and behold i was totally caught by surprise  quaker has done it again  this was a snack for me on a summery hot day  it was very light  flavorful and i cant wait to purchase a whole box of these  kids will love them too   yummy and very filling ,1,0
2534,compared with arizona s bottled teas  this product is clearly the winner  it tastes fresh  while the arizona pre mixed tea tastes stale    like it sits in warehouses too long prior to being sold    which i imagine it does  other instant tea mixes vary from poor to barely acceptable  this mix is  clearly and refreshingly  at the  tea top   x cellent instant tea mix,1,0
2535,when this arrived in the mail i started opening up the box it was shipped in and my dog was all over it  trying to get at it  it reminded me of christmas when i get him treats in his stocking  i guess he thought it smelled very good  he was jumping around trying to see what i was opening  once i fed him  he really ate it up  i am  happy to see him enjoy his food so much  as if it is a special treat instead of plain old dinner  could barely get it out of the package   ,1,0

2524,if you have tried melinda s habanero sauces before  or marie sharps forcomparison  and you like the flavor and consistency  but need more heat then this is just for you melinda s advertising is somewhat misleading  as this sauce is listed at577 000 scovilles  its not  the lower scale of melinda s habanero selectionsare i e  xxx  xxxx reserve  etc  are separated by degrees of heat  no doubtthis is the hottest of the habanero family  but i d hazard to guess this isno more than 50 000 scovilles  although i m not doubting the savinas weretested and certified at 577k  but this sauce is not going to blow the topof your head off when i mention the recipe  i mean this    ingredients  red savina peppers hand selected choice red habanero peppers  fresh carrots  onions  lime juice vinegar  garlic  and salt  the vinegar is not noticeable  but in classicmelinda s fashion you get a pulpy carrot citrus based blast of pure heat thatwill satisfy most chiliheads now i m not saying this stuff is not hot  it sneaks up on you  and just asyou re noticing the mellow flavor of carrots with a lime juice underscore you may suddenly realize that the back of your mouth is on fire  but it wontleave any scar tissue or ruin your evening  so as you move up the heat scale don t pass this sauce by  its terrific on anything  and do yourself a favor and remove that little stopper dropper so you can get a liberal dose 5 scovies  follows melinda s basic winning recipe ,1,0
43,sizes of pots and trees may vary   mine looks like the pictures with notes uploaded by another amazon member   this means that my item s ceramic pot is 6  long and 4  wide  which is much smaller than what is in product description  and does not have the miniature bridge   my juniper tree is 5  tall  which is also shorter than minimum height described in product description i contacted the seller regarding such discrepancies and was partially refunded   seller was nice and refunded quickly   price is already a steal and my tree is healthy  so i decide to keep it it arrived well packaged and on time  sizes vary,1,0
2442,this conditioner has a light scent that is not bad  but not my favorite  this conditioner seems to have extra conditioning power  it must be the shea oil  my hair came out really smooth and clean  but it felt super conditioned  i don t know if this is a product that i would use all the time  because it almost conditioned too much  for my hair  i m also not crazy about the scent  i thought the moisturizing oil smelled much better and i was disappointed this wasn t the same  if i was in the market for a super conditioning extra moisturizer product this one would be a good choice  extra conditioning,1,0
2441,this is true jerky not the kind that looks stamped or processed  this being said because of the natural variances of beef some pieces are smaller or contain a trace of fat or may be grisly but this is not a common occurrence  i purchase 4 pkgs of this per month and have been for 8 months  in my opinion  this is the best out there for the price  its consistent in quality and you get 16oz  i have tried all the flavors and my favorites are hickory  peppered and bbq so this review will apply to these flavors  great tasting,1,0
73,okay   first off  only 150 calories for the whole pint   i mean  you can eat the whole thing for the same amount of calories as a cookie or  in some cases  a half a cookie   don t even get started on a muffin   even if you sit down and polish off half the container  you don t have to feel bad about it secondly  this is my second favorite flavor of this brand  coming closely after the maple vanilla  and when i really really want a frozen latte but can t deal with how many calories are in it  then this gets the the cold coffee fix for a lot less guilt the coffee flavor is strong  but not overpowering and  as to texture  if you are expecting creamy ice cream then you may be disappointed   but if you re used to trying other frozen treats that don t have the texture of ice cream  or if you like sorbets then this may be up your alley the only difficulty is that some grocery stores don t seem to carry this brand or  if they do  it sells out quick   but well worth a try and at 150 calories   why not  hello coffee drinkers,1,0
72,note  box says only  six tropical flavors  but does not list them anywhere   amazon description says flavors berry punch  watermelon  pineapple  tropical punch  citrus punch  banana   no way to verify this  but they do taste good   still the same characters from the  regular  flavor packs  1 5oz each pop  10  long,1,0

71,looking for a soy free  gluten free chocolate cake mix that actually tasted good  i picked this mix up on sale  the texture was great  it far exceeded my expectations as far as both texture and taste for the cake itself  the frosting was a disappointment  i should have followed my instincts and not added all the water at once  instead one tbsp  at a time until i got the consistency right  it tasted fine  but was completely runny and watery  i ended up dumping it over anyway  which made it like a chocolate fudge cake  which honestly didn t hurt it  despite not looking like it should have it tasted great and even non gf peeps were taking it rather than the regular cake at my daughters  birthday party  i ll be buying it again  because it s great to have a decent tasting mix that everyone in the family can enjoy  next time i ll add the water to the frosting one tbsp  at a time  though  exceeded expectations except the  frosting ,1,0
2354,i gave this product 5 stars because well   it s awesome  the value was incredible  and the variety was superb my only gripe   if you even want to call it that   is that this is advertised as crazy cups 70 pack that comes in those pretty display boxes  i know the difference between these  because i ordered this 70 pack not to long ago for about  10 more that s pretty much why i gave it 5 stars  i got 70 awesome k cups as advertised  they just happen to be thrown into a usps flat rate box of sorts  i can assure you though there was not one k cup damaged  and i m enjoying the hell out of these  so again  5 stars all around  just be aware you probably won t get them in those 2 display boxes  and that could really piss you off if you happen to be gifting these to somebody  maybe personally  i ll be buying again for sure  5 stars   but read on   ,1,0
70,we re a household of cheez it fans  so everyone was excited to try the new mozzarella flavor   first of all  we were disappointed because many crackers had broken during shipping  so there were lots of crumbled bits scattered throughout the box   however  the ones that remained were tangy and tasty   they don t have quite the same texture as the regular cheddar flavor and do crumble a bit more easily   however  this is a nice blend of salty and cheesy   if you like the regular flavor and want to try something new  give these a try  tangy snacking ,1,0
69,order shipped quickly   it is packaged quite securely for a bag of coffee  a box within a box   airbags    however  i ordered scandinavian blend  but received  a bag with the label tanzania kilimanjaro   the coffee smells fantastic  and i am out of coffee  so i have no intention of returning it   alas  i do not know if it s mislabeled or the wrong item shipped   guess i ll find out next order  scandinavian blend may or may not be in tanzanian kilimanjaro bag,1,0
2356,i have a huge dog and a wee beagle  i won t lie  they would eat anything and have tried   well  they won t eat cucumber peelings if they drop on the floor  weird   i served them beneful and they woofed it down  no problem      i do believe that the bag picture and name are misleading  as well as the ad campaign for this dog food  it s not very beneficial for your dog and the top ingredients are total junk and filler  i prefer chicken soup for the dog lover s soul dry dog food for senior dog  chicken flavor  35 pound bag but it s way  way more expensive  with beneful  you are going to see a lot of waste  so to speak  when your dog  goes for a walk   there is a belief that if you feed your dog good  quality food  there is less waste because there is so much nutrition being gleaned from the food  i d say this is true  but not so much less waste that you can  oh   get another dog  or take smaller poo bags on your walks   hahaha  this food is more like  homemade play dough  if you took homemade play dough  which is mostly salt  and shaped it into the form of a carrot and a chunk of steak  then ate it  you would still be eating salt  not meat or veggies  beneful looks like food  but it s mostly junk  why the four stars  because i ve been feeding my dogs cheap food all their lives  and fed the same kind of food to my passed on dogs and they all did fine  they all lived to their life s expectancy and beyond  no health issues  ever  except for a dog ate a corncob incident  which if you think about it  i would not have had with just kibble   and they had have energy  healthy teeth  coats that shine etc  overall  if you can afford better food  i say go for it  dogs love it  picture on bag is very misleading ,1,0
2357,my dogs are non verbal  at least  not in a language i understand   so they didn t have a lot to say about beneful   but  i take it as a  two paws up  when the bowl is empty soon after i fill it   we have a pomeranian and a bichon and neither have ever had issues with weight   but our bichon does tend to get rashes if she eats foods that don t agree with her   we ve generally just bought store brand dog food and that s been fine  but they poop a lot because of the fillers   i noticed with beneful  they still poop every day  but not as much and they seem much more energetic   so  we ve decided to stick with beneful because the price isn t bad and it works for our pups  two paws up,1,0

2360,this stuff chases away pests from the house area  back to the woods where they belong   it does not repel bears  salesmen  or coyotes  but it isn t supposed to do that the beauty of it it that it is not a poison   i enjoy sharing the land with critters  but don t want them right up to the house   if it will work on the colony of flying squirrels in my attic  i will update it s rating to 5 stars  repels  doesn t kill,1,0

67,my interest in dr  fuhrman led me to this product  i felt compelled to write a review because i feel that another reviewer really should not have taken off any stars for the mere 2 grams of saturated fat  this product contains 1 ingredient  which is almonds   the other reviewer should read what dr  fuhrman has to say about fats from foods such as nuts as far as the product goes  this is one of the better raw almond butters i have tasted   nice texture and flavor  nothing fancy since it only has almonds and nothing else but still very good and naturally mildly sweet  may not seem sweet to those used to eating lots of sugar   seems a little bit too pricey  especially for not being organic  i would have taken off a star for this but wanted to give a higher rating due to above mentioned review    however  it is very likely i will purchase this again  it s a nice way to help increase consumption of plant protein  don t worry about the saturated fat ,1,0
2349,product description aside    what really matters to me is if my dog will like the food  and guess what  she does  purina is a trusted name in the dog food industry and the beneful delivers a healthy product  i give it five stars  i would not if my dog didn t like it  my dog loves it,1,0
2361,  it has an alright taste  reminds me of cough syrup in a very sweet and condensed form   keep in mind that honey made in different parts of the world tastes looks different  this one is from brazil   canada   easily opened  a bit too easily though   the plastic covering where the cap screws off wasn t even any use  i twisted the cap and the plastic covering came off with it   big jar  putting my entire hand around it  i can only reach halfway   can be messy since the honey is very sticky and can also be difficult to get a full spoonful onto a piece of bread without making a mess   the  expire date  seems strange  i purchased this in mid 2012  and it says  best by 01 15  even though natural honey shouldn t be able spoil  but i suppose it s required by u s law  maybe someone can clear this up  nice honey,1,0

63,this was awesome  i got 35 different flavors of kcups  with mixed flavors and brands here is a rough breakdown off the top of my head i got 5 different celestial teas1 hot chocolate5 ish decafs7 8 varieties of regular coffee  different strengths including  jet fuel  and the rest were flavored coffees  some of the highlights were butter toffee  cinnamon roll  blueberry  french toast  too many to list most of the kcups expire in december  which is plenty of time to drink them there were a few seasonal ones  pumpkin  eggnog  gingerbread  that expire in august  which is a little bit of a bummer  but i guess it s to be expected because those are seasonal ones  i m still glad i got them  so i can try them to determine if i want to order whole cases of them this winter i will definitely order again   i m really happy with it  i ve give this more than 5 stars  if i could ,1,0
2369,the cappuccino tastes very similar to the starbucks bottled kind it s neither too tasty nor too disgusting    simply average  if you put it in the refridgerator for a few hours beforehand  it ll taste refreshing the 8 45 size is about the right amount of caffeine  a cup   a cool kick in the summer,1,0
2370,i just bought about 20 boxes of these from the dollar store for  1 each  they re awesome but this is way over priced i like to mix them with the lemonhead mix 50 50 and make cherry lemonade 5 calories per serving and about 20mg of sodium  two servings per packet  tastes great   horrible price,1,0
2371,for an adult  this has a semi sweet taste likely due to the pears   the taste of the broccoli or spinach masked by the semi sweet taste thankfully   the product tastes and feels somewhat like a light version of apple sauce   the taste is somewhere in the ballpark of naked juice s green machine   this product manages to put about every insensitivity alergy buzz word on the package    gluten free  nut free  bpa free  etc   the product has very clear serving instructions and is easy to open   the cap is a choking hazard which is unfortunate but i don t know of a better solution where you can still have a nice feeding tube present   i d rather give up the plastic cap and feeding tube for the environment and use maybe a tear open package feeding this product to a 6  month old child  the reaction was neutral compared to his other favorite meals   this was based on his body language and facial reaction    the best i can do     note that the item i received in july 2012 also had an expiration date of july 2012   i m not sure if these packets normally have such a short shelf life or not   perhaps since they don t have so many preservatives in them you have to use the product quickly  convenient   healthy,1,0
62,not only is this snack great but try it on top of salmon with crumbled blue cheese or in dressing  not only a snack,1,0
2373,i was a little wary trying these because i don t like dense  chewy bars that hurt your jaw to eat  and that s what i really thought this was going to be  i couldn t have been more wrong  i bit into it and got a crunch from the almonds on top and  i had to check the ingredients  soy crisps inside  i received one bar as a sample and went out and bought an entire box that same week  however  even though on the package it says that it tastes great heated up  i didn t like it  heated up it lost the crunch and seemed to become that dreaded chewy bar  i still give this product 5 stars though because heating it up is definitely not something that you have to do  fantastic,1,0
2374,mostly peanuts   good tasting bar without the huge amount of sweet stuff in most candy bars   very crunchy  not at all greasy   almost all bars come broken into several pieces  which is probably pretty much inevitable  i guess   however  eating smaller pieces is not a problem unless the bar is completely shattered  which doesn t happen very often  planter s peanut bars,1,0

2362,this hot coca tastes pretty good when brewed on 8oz setting however its not the best i ve ever tasted nor the worst  its hard to rate this because everyone has different tastes so its ether you like it or you don t  i my self happen to like it and will buy again unless i find something better  tastes pretty good,1,0
60,the special k granola bars are quite tasty   they are  95 oz  which translates into a bar 3 25  long and just over 1  wide   they are on the small side  but are still slightly larger than quaker chewy granola bars   it may be their small size that accounts for the low calorie count because they taste really good  not at all like a diet granola bar they are considerably more expensive than quaker chewy granola bars  however   a package of 30 costs  22   75 ea  while a package of 48 quaker bars costs  16   35 ea    i do think the special k bars taste a little better and are chewier i do recommend this product  soft  chewy  tastes like a candy bar,1,0
2348,what made me want to try this product  clear scalp   hair therapy  moisturizing dry scalp  besides that  was that this is a new product line   to be honest  their product line is so extensive  it was kind of hard  at least for me  to know which product would be the correct one for me in the end  i decided to go with the moisturizing dry scalp version  but i was only able to order the conditioner version  and not also the shampoo  which is what i would have ordered  both of them  because i have found that when you use both the shampoo as well as the conditioner  the results are better than if you had used only one of the products   the shampoo version was already out through the vine program  which is how i was able to order this conditioner first of all  i like the sleek  modern design of the bottle  tho i would have preferred that the opening be on the top of the bottle  rather than the bottom of the bottle  which is how it is   i guess due to the shape of the top of the bottle  maybe that made the option of having the opening be on the top of the bottle instead of the bottom of the bottle  how it is  impossible the bottle opening is to the left of the bottle  so you just open that rather than other bottles  where the whole opening has to be opened up  like if the opening is on the top of the bottle  at least for some shampoos and conditioners  to enable you to be able to dispense the shampoo or conditioner that you need   in any case  i prefer the opening to the bottle be on top of the bottle  and not on the bottom of the bottle   it s a personal preference the bottle size is 12 7 ounces  which seems standard as far as the size of the bottle  unless you buy the supersized bottle in a shampoo or conditioner i love the scent of the conditioner  which thankfully i love it  because i always smell scented products  if i do not like the scent of a product  i will not purchase it the bottle says there are 10 vitamins and nutrients   the back of the bottle says it provides up to 2 times more moisturization  but that is if you use both the shampoo and conditioner so  it s kind of hard to judge how well this product really works  without also using the shampoo too i did like how it made my scalp feel  but then i normally do like how most shampoos and conditioners  in the dry scalp version  make my scalp and hair feel having very  very thick hair  i cannot just use a conditioner   i also have to use a conditioning  detangling spray  in able to brush my hair out when it s wet so  in all fairness it is kind of hard to judge this conditioner  without being able to try the shampoo too  this conditioner works fairly well,1,0
2346,i read other reviews and i wasn t sure to buy this or not for my brother s party as a favor being star wars fan of iv  v and vi versions only i was really happy and pleased to have received mostly characters from such versions only i received only 1 yoda  4 darth vaders  a couple of c3pos  a couple of r2d2s and a couple of darth mauls       not bad  all the characters that we like probably it was luck  but i m really happy with what i got     i m even thinking on buying a second set  very pleased with the distribution,1,0
2319,this product is more than a candy   it can be used as a settler for the stomach   on a road trip i developed a terrible nauseating feeling and my stomach was queasy   i know ginger is a good stomach soother   we stopped to a small store along the way and this ginger candy was recommended   it worked for me and my daughter   it did take me a minute to adjust to the strong ginger flavor and texture   it is chewy and slightly sweet   once i did  my queasy stomach was settled in about 20 minutes   i would recommend this it definitely has a strong ginger flavor   if you like ginger no problem  it works   ,1,0
84,i notice nobody has reviewed this product yet so i thought i d put my   02 in   as a bonus goodie  i received a small box of eight pieces with a proflowers order  and can recognize most of them in the above photo    i thought the candies were quite good  perhaps not on a par with godiva but w a a y above russell stover  and very fresh   flavors were pretty traditional  semi sweet raspberry truffle  milk chocolate caramel  peanut butter shell   aspen  creme  very buttery  and so on   my assortment came in a brown box with a yellow ribbon and contained a photo guide to the contents   a definite treat  quite good  actually,1,0

2324,i just got through reviewing another brand of litter  arm   hammer essentials  that i used when i ran out of feline pine and it was awful   trust me  i m stocking up on feline pine because it s in another league   first  it s not scented or perfumed in any way   it has a slight cedary smell that is pleasant and your cat likes and is drawn to   second  it has large  pellets  that disintegrate when your cat pees so you can tell if they are using the box  that s important if you are concerned with urinary issues and want something natural    also  if your cat has recently had surgery and you are concerned about litter getting into the stitches and impeding the healing process  try this feline pine or wheat scoop  both are natural and easy to use and will not hurt your cat   finally  with this litter you don t have to worry about your cat breathing in harmful dust particles that cause respiratory issues and allergies   it is expensive litter  don t get me wrong  but i have learned over time that it s worth the cost because it is safe  easy to clean up  and your cat likes using the litter box more with feline pine so there tends to be less bathroom  problems    this is not powdery and won t coat every surface with dust   it is  chunky  and pellet like  won t get in your animal s eyes and cause irritation  and does seem to absorb odors effectively  awesome litter  easy to use  ,1,0
2325,quick review here    the oil does what it says  it moisturizes the scalp and hair  if you re like me and have very dry skin  get dandruff  and stay itchy then this product is for you  if not  i think it would just make your hair more oily  so  i don t recommend this for people with naturally oily hair  but  like i said  if you have dry  or damaged  hair or a dry scalp  then this product really works  moisturizes the scalp and hair,1,0

81,i ve been drinking two leaves and a bud ever since a friend gave me a box to try a couple months back  i haven t bothered with other teas after that  i have it on a daily basis the reviews regarding the  snails  that were in the packaging are from a while ago  no photos were provided  so it s hard to say how truthful they are or rather if their assumptions were correct  are you sure it was snails   and even if that was the case  i m sure by this point the matter has been resolved  i can t imagine two leaves and a bud disregarding such a quality control mistep  i m drinking a cup of their chamomile tea as i write this review  there s nothing wrong with it  the familiar taste is there  get your kettle ready  the original,1,0
2328,like most people who routinely buy organic products  i m accustomed to mark ups in the 10  to 50  range  i usually think it s worth it to know what i m ingesting  thus  i would overlook the price of organic valley organic nonfat dry milk powder were it not for the fact that getting the powder to dissolve in water is nearly impossible  per the instructions on the package  i used cold  chilled  water  i tried shaking it vigorously   again  per package instructions   to no avail   put it in the fridge for a while so it can dissolve   i thought  bad idea  when i took it out  the undissolved lumps of powder had formed a crust the exact consistency of spackle on the surface of the water   ah  a whisk  that ll do the trick   was my next bright idea  no  the lumps of spackle adhered to the wires of the whisk with a large mass of partially dissolved powder stuck accumulating in the center  i thought of taking a pitcher of water and milk powder to my local paint store and asking them to put it in the gadget that shakes the living heck out of paint  but that seemed like too much trouble and they might not appreciate my not buying any paint  i did get satisfactory results with an immersion blender  finally  so if you happen to have one on hand  by all means give organic valley organic nonfat dry milk powder a try  by the way  if you do buy some and find a way to make it dissolve in water  please let me know  i look forward to hearing how you did it p s  once it s mixed  the milk is good  but a little on the sweet side  a bit difficult to mix,1,0
80,i manage the snack fund where i work and i go the extra step to have these imported  they sell wayyy too fast besides the jalapeno flavor   they taste like butt  i bought three boxes and they were gone within 5 days   besides the jalapeno flavor   they taste like butt  they go like hotcakes,1,0
2330,great toy for short periods of observed play   my adult cattledog figured out how to removed the ball almost immediately  while the puppy took several minutes   even so  they have not tired of playing the game   after removing the ball quickly a few times  they will complicate the puzzle by tossing the cube around  batting at it with their paws  pouncing on it   and only then remove the ball   they wait for me to put the ball back in  and wait until i tell them to  go find  this is not for the dog who runs off with a toy and plays keep away  as the thin rubber  bars  of the cube could be easily chewed and ingested  my puppy had to be told not to chew it    of course  all of the kyjen puzzle toys are designed to be enjoyed by dogs playing in the company of their owners   they are excellent training tools for  wait    go find    give  and the concept of taking turns  one dog waits while the other finds    i work my dogs on them for about 15 minutes  then put the toys away   they stay new and exciting that way  cattledog approved ,1,0
2331,there was a groundhog digging all around our shed  he had entrances at all four sides of the shed  and we couldn t get rid of it for ages  this year i applied the critter ridder at each of his holes and i see vegetation growing around undisturbed  and i didn t  see the animal since then most important  it didn t smell of urine as other repellents  so i could actually enjoy my yard after applicationmy only complaint was with the jar shaker cover  it lets too much product out so you should be careful and not dump the mix all in one big pile edit on september 28  2012  the company representative commented on my post that the lid has adjustable opening  i checked the package  and it is true   you can open it halfway  and it  clicks  in this position  so it won t slide as you shake  i wish i realized it earlier and i still do not see the groundhog  so the repellent still works  maybe it is because i applied too much of it earlier  seems to be working for grounhogs,1,0
2332,ok i don t rate many food items   i am afraid to give it 5 stars because that is going to make it more difficult to find   my local store had a shelf set up for 15 items   i saw how all the shelves were full of bbq sauces and this one was off the shelf minus one bottle   i just made some pulled pork wanted a new sauce   so i bought the last bottle   i could not believe the flavor   it has a little not much heat in the backround and full of flavor   i had two of my other favorite sauces out and tried a taste of them after having this one  guy fieri sauce made my favorite sauces taste flat   so went back and still shelf is empty so paying to buy more online its that good  sold out in local store,1,0
2333,i could not find any source for a variety of actual reviews for the ariel wines anywhere  some from a few wine snob bloggers  what i did read was very  very negative  so i decided to go ahead and review it here  i was infinitely curious about it and finally broke down and paid the  6 to try it myself  anticipating that i might have to dump it it is totally fine as the review title suggests  no real off smells or flavors as some report  perhaps more with the de alcoholized reds   and the flavor is pretty sweet  but not as sweet as the many juices  sodas  and spritzers i end up drinking as alternatives to alcoholic beverages i mix a little bit of home brewed kombucha to cut the sweet and imagine it would also be good as a spritzer  i ll probably try the other varieties now but i bet this blanc is the safest bet  totally fine ,1,0
2347,i tried this even though i had previously not like another clear scalp product   the long lengths shampoo and conditioner had not worked well for me but i decided to give the brand another try like the first clear scalp product i ordered  this one had leaked substantially   i would estimate that about 1 5 of the product had leaked into the plastic wrapper surrounding the bottle other than that this was a completely different experience from trying the first product   i really liked the smell   the conditioner felt like it soaked in and rinsed out nicely   my wet hair felt smooth and tangle free   i live in the high desert so my hair gets dried out terribly   it is also color treated   but the dry scalp conditioner made both my scalp and hair feel good   my hair was soft but had no  flyaways for the price and performance i will keep using this product  i like the product  but the packaging leaks,1,0

2339,i tried this even though i had previously not like another clear scalp product   the long lengths shampoo and conditioner had not worked well for me but i decided to give the brand another try like the first clear scalp product i ordered and the conditioner i got with this  this one had leaked substantially   it wasn t as bad as the conditioner leak but opening it was a mess other than that this was a completely different experience from trying the first product   i really liked the smell   the shampoo lathered nicely  we have very hard water    it didn t leave my hair feeling stripped or tangled when i washed it out   it smelled good and rinsed nicely for the price and performance i will keep using this product  pretty good   i will repurchase ,1,0
2340,i purchased these on a whim  and after researching for other disposable products  i have the single mesh filter plastic re usable one  but the  convenience  factor of a disposable is not there  you have to then clean it and all that mess  with this product  simply pop a filter  included  into the cup   included  fill it with 1 2tsp of your own blend  or folgers starbucks  anything  and use the included cup holder to pop a lid on  which are also included  i bought 50 and am now so happy with these i m ordering 200 more  why   because for the 12 15  you spend on these cups you can make 50 coffee s  if you have some regular coffee in your fridge  use that  you can even say a bag of starbucks breakfast blend ground is around 10 00  so your at 22 00   thats only 2 boxes of 12 kcups coffee s and you can fill 75 100 on a single 1lb bag  a 1 5lb tub of folgers can fill about 400 of these refills for 9 00 for the tub  so go for it  you won t regret it   one thing i want to point out is the included filters do hang out the edges a bit  nothing wrong  it just adds to the seal  and depending on your brewers strength you can see  seepage  after brewing a cup  but who cares  they are disposable  if you are a total cheap wad you can pop the lids off and use the cups again if you don t mind a whole in the bottom from where the brewer pops it  but your freshness won t last with a re used cup   hope this review helps    thanks  a must for anyone who thinks k cups are too expensive,1,0

2341,i initially purchased this mix because the eggs were not included and it doesn t contain peanuts tree nuts and is not processed in a facility that does  my 3 year old has nut and egg allergies and is gluten intolerant  i have made 3 loaves now and finally my 3rd attempt came out perfect  i used ener g egg replacer for the 2 eggs required in the recipe  the first batch i made in a machine that did not have a gluten free cycle  i used the quick cycle and the loaf came out ok  not great  the crust was very thick and hard an i had to cut it off to make it edible  the second batch i made in a machine with a gluten free cycle and the loaf was slightly underdone in the middle  so a little dense  i just made the third loaf with the gluten free cycle  i just extended the cycle by choosing a darker crust option  the results were a beautiful  fluffy  tender loaf that my 3 year ate with gusto  my search for sandwich bread is over  now on to burger buns       successfully egg free ,1,0

75,i ate one of these pouches so i would know what to expect from them   honestly  all i could taste was pear so although i believe the other ingredients mentioned are in them  they are pretty sweet  and i worry about creating a baby with a sweet tooth as a result   there are few ingredients  good in my book   i prefer to eat nothing that has more than 5 ingredients  and they appear to be of a high quality i miss the old baby food jars which seem greener to me   if you didn t recycle the glass  you could at least save the jars for storage of small items   the bpa free packaging of these does make it easy to get the contents out  and the lid can be screwed back on so that the pouch can be finished later  but overall  there is a lot of trash generated from them  organically sweet but healthy,1,0
2343,so instead of fish for a dorm room pet  too much work   constant feeding  cleaning out bowl  etc   i decided to get these fantastic carnivorous plants  what a great purchase  first  you can tell when you open the package how much the seller really cares about his plants and how serious he is about his business  the plants are carefully packaged in ziploc baggies  their roots are covered in a damp paper towel  and they are placed in the box which is full of dried moss and very detailed instructions  i do not have a lot of experience with carnivorous plants  let alone the grass that grows on my lawn  but the instructions are clear cut and setting the plants up took only 5 10 minutes  there happened to be a tiny little ant that was hiding in a plant root  and when i was unwrapping the paper towel he crawled up the plant  he made his way into the mouth of the venus fly trap  but it didn t close  so hopefully  it will be hungry soon and i ll get to see the plants in action  i love these things  they are too cool  i can t wait to put them in my dorm when i move in  so cool  my dorm room  pet ,1,0
2344,i love these things  i have not had the reaction others have had  in fact i have no reaction to olestra olean at all  compared to other items on the market like  fiber one  bars and chicory root extract which i cannot handle they taste just like the original with half the calories  i find myself eating a whole stack along with a sandwich on my diet because they are just so good and only 420 calories per can  easily can fit into a diet program with exercise   i otherwise never eat potato chips because of the fat content  and will not suffer through eating  baked  chips  i wish more products came with olean in them  i d be on cloud nine  snyders of hanover honey mustard onion pretzels would be high on my list  as would  sun dried tomato and basil  wheat thins  oddly enough  i have no reaction to olestra,1,0

2345,i considered myself a chai snob  i brewed my tea from leaves  in a trinitea brewer  well  my chai supplier  adiago  were constantly out of stock on their 16oz bags  funny how they always had 3oz bags in stock at a higher price though   so i started searching around  this brand name kept popping up in review forums and tea blogs  i look on amazon and it s a powdered beverage mix    no no no  that will not do  so i tried a few other sellers and the chai was bitter and inferior  just various black teas with little to no spice  ugh so i broke down and decided to order this  price was good and i have prime shipping so what the heck  i said  two days later  i have these two huge containers and just  brewed  my first cup  basically  my tea brewer has been demoted to water boiler lol  and it is exactly the taste i have been looking for  all i ever wanted was to duplicate the chai latte i got at my local espresso house  not even adiago tea tastes like this  though to be honest  adiago makes great chai  it s just different    if that s not genuine chai  then i don t care  you don t even have to add sugar or cream  i like this stuff and i ll get it again  feel kinda guilty   ,1,0

2058,i too have been searching for senseo pods for months and finally decided to try another brand  i think the senseo pods are now coming back in stock btw   these do fit the senseo and the taste is good  however  out of the 3 packages  2 had pods that had broken inside and spilled grounds all over the other pods   this is inconvenient and messy   i did order another set to see if this was a fluke but lots of other reviewers have experienced the same thing  if i get more broken pods  i will switch back to the senseos now that they seem to be available in limited selections  fits senseo but pods broken in bag,1,0
59,i am not a big ginger guy but this is not that bad  i do like ginger ale soda so i thought i might like this too  i brew it hot but i drink it cold  for me it was way better having it over ice than drinking it hot  the ginger was a lot stronger when hot than cold  maybe its because the melted ice made it watery and diluted the ginger but i prefer it cold like an ice cold ice tea  you don t taste the lemon much  i would have preferred to taste a lot more lemon since it is ginger and lemon but it is more of ginger with a hint of lemon  overall it is a good drink but you will probably either hate it or love it  not bad   ,1,0

2410,these couldn t be easier   you pour one packet into a bowl  add 2 cups of cold water  and microwave for 3 4 minutes   they are already flavored  although i did add butter to mine as i didn t initially anticipate that they would be flavorful on their own they have a bit of a sour bite which implies that there is some sour cream in the seasoning  i didn t bother to check    it s not overbearing  but my first few bites took me aback a little as i was expecting more of the usual blandness from powdered mashed potatoes   i also didn t need to add any salt  but i wouldn t say they were too salty  just right i thought the flavor  texture  and quantity were good and better than many instant mashed potato products i ve tried   each packet says it makes 4 servings  that would be 1 2 cup each   i would usually eat more than that for a serving  but they are filling  like real potatoes   i d guess for most people a packet makes 2 3 servings  surprisingly good considering you only add water,1,0
2411,as someone trying to replace my coffee addiction with something healthier  but still caffeinated    i was very pleased to find this product in my local costco for fifteen dollars   i was somewhat skeptical  as i have always found green teas to be somewhat unremarkable  but this product is excellent   it is aromatic  flavorful  and makes me feel like i am ingesting something healthy   if you buy this tea  you will not be disappointed   if you do not live near a costco   23 is not a terrible price for this tea   that s only  0 23 a bag   just don t forget to tap the remaining matcha in the packet onto your tea       it enhances the flavor of the product  very green  very flavorful ,1,0
49,i gave this to my girlfriend to review since she has long  color treated hair the fragrance is interesting  i don t think it s too terrible  but it s not one that i just have to use  this was sent in a padded envelope  it didn t leak but there is the possibility i used the conditioner with the corresponding shampoo  when i first used it  it didn t feel like i was actually putting anything into my hair  i m used to conditioners that have the feel of a thick lotion that gets worked into the ends of my hair  my hair did feel a little dry when i rinsed it out and i was very skeptical i could easily run a brush through my wet hair  usually my hair is a knot from ringing out the water  but this time the brush slid through my hair with no knots  this is a lighter conditioner so my hair has more volume when dried  my hair is not weighted down by the excess product that didn t get rinsed off i do like this conditioner  this would be a conditioner that i would purchase again  i have bleached fine hair and this conditioner made it feel thicker and healthier shawn kovacichauthor and creator of numerous books and dvd s  my girlfriend loved it,1,0
2412,i work at cvs and whenever someone buys this water bottle  it s because of how appealing the bottle actually looks rather than the water  these come in two different types of bottle  one being glass and other being plastic  this one is a plastic bottle  don t get me wrong  the plastic bottle still looks beautiful and is very sturdy  it s not your average poland spring bottle  aside from the looks  the taste of the water is no different than poland spring or nestle bottled water  these usually sell for  1 60 at cvs so  this price online is kind of high  if you really want to try this water  or just want the bottle for the look and future use  just go to a local drugstore or grocery and pick one up  it will be much cheaper and you will get to see and feel the bottle in person to see if it s for you  overall  it s a good buy and offers a very appealing bottle but the taste is pretty much the same as any other bottled water  i personally bought a bottle because it is so sturdy and i can refill it for everyday use  plus the appealing presentation of the bottle doesn t hurt either  good,1,0
2413,this beverage is becoming harder and harder to find   i have been drinking the international coffees since i hit adulthood around 20  and it is my only real addiction  no smokes  no booze  just let me have a cup of this if i m going to work  and an extra cup if i m not for serious coffee drinkers  this is not strong  it s very sweet  and each flavor is different enough that most of them don t mix well  for example  if you have two partial cans of two different flavors  you are better off just drinking two half cups of coffee than mixing them  unless your sense of taste is somewhat blunted french vanilla and vanilla caramel are my faves  and i cannot find them on store shelves   maxwell house bought the chain from g foods  and i allowed time for the transition  sadly  they went to plastic from metal cans  but if it had kept the coffee available  i d still buy it    what i have  i bought from amazon s third parties you can still get surplus sugar free  but why   go drink a glass of water   or even worse  decaffeinated   suisse mocha shows up once in awhile  and even though it is more cocoa ish  i drink it if it s all i can get oh  please  let s bring this product back to wider circulation   i have a serious jones for the stuff   expensive   yes  compared to other packaged coffee  but not compared to a couple of lattes a day  i want it back ,1,0
2414,overall not bad but they could have been better   such as being crispier  they tasted okay  but nothing to write home about  the quaker chewy granola bars are better in my opinion  but if you like a softer cookie  these might be right up your alley  tasty but dry,1,0
2415,personnaly  i don t care for soft cookies  however my wife loves them   so i got these for her   when queried  she said   not bad   not bad at all   so   wifey gives these cookies a two thumbs up   she still perfers oreos  but these are a very close second  sweet,1,0

2419,purchased one of these last july to replace an older unit that failed after about three years of use   it sat in the package for a year before being installed today   it does not produce hardly any voltage   ran a volt meter on it and only came up with 143v  not enough to even feel   the last one worked great for those three years  so am not sure what is going on with this one guess i need to recant my above review  ran new wire all the way around  including a new ground wire   the unit is now working just fine  so it turns out the problem was my own fault   the fence tested out just fine now and the charger is working as it should   also makes me believe there is nothing wrong with the old one we replaced  just ignorance on my part   need to upgrade my review to five stars   there is enough of a jolt that we should not have to worry about the dogs digging out  but not enough hurt them  fi shock ss725,1,0

47,i saw this product on food network s new show invention hunter  it is very cool  i read a several news reporting that people are sick because of drinking from contamainated soda cans  drinking duck is very easy to use and it acts as a protective layer prevents my lips from directly contact the soda can  it makes me more comfortable to drink beverage from the can now  it seems made of silicone  which provides a nice touch to the lips  i don t taste the metal taste from the can or the freeze anymore  it is a very cool gadget  i use it at my party  all my friends can identify their own can  so they don t pop a new one before they finish theirs  so it prevents a lot of unnecessary waste of unfinished beverages  it s a good substitute for staws  kids like the ducky anyways   very cool  featured on food network show ,1,0
2424,i bought these pens to make faces on lego mini figure pops made from marshmallows dipped in candy chocolate   i put the finished pops in the refrigerator to set before marking   the pen worked well in the beginning  but as the candy chocolate coating started to warm up  the condensation made drawing almost impossible   no worries though  the package contained two pens so i merely switched back and forth  plus i wiped each surface dry before marking which helped immensely   i m not sure how well it would mark on fondant  but any dry surface would probably work  worked moderately well,1,0

2438,for those saying it doesn t pass the taste test    try sprinkling parmesan cheese or fortiflora on top  many cats take time to transition to a raw diet because it s not as stinky as commercially made food  sort of like how children prefer sugar cereal to something healthy like oatmeal  with time and patience any cat can be won over about the taurine content    if you go to the honest kitchen website  you can take a look at the nutritional values  this product does contain an adequate amount of taurine  some corrections,1,0

2382,i ve tried many brands  types  and shapes of shirataki noodles  this is actually up there with some of my favorites  yes  you must know how to prepare these properly  i like to rinse them well in a small plastic colander  then place the colander on a saucer and microwave for 4 minutes on high  when it comes out  it s very hot  steamy  and most of water will be drained from the noodles themselves  which makes it primed and ready for sauce  the texture on these vs others i ve tried is nice   not as rubbery  but just know  these can not compare to flour based pasta in texture   flour  starch  is the very ingredient that makes pasta s texture what it is  becoming increasingly soft and thickening sauces as it cooks  these do not do that  but for those looking for something that helps to avoid starches and carbs  this does the trick  as for the brown color  i honestly did not notice any taste difference  like the white  it s tasteless and absorbs the flavor of the sauce served with it  excellent shirataki option,1,0

2384,since my friend is into rescue work  i figured this dog food would be great to test on her two dogs and the five shelter dogs she is working with   all the dogs ate this food eagerly and they were not starving dogs   i also decided to do a taste test with two dog foods  this food and the chef michael s grilled sirloin dry dog food 4 5 pound bag i was reviewing   the one dog i tested it on sniffed both dog foods but chose to eat the chef michael s grilled sirloin dry dog food  first   however  he then finished off this food as well after devouring the other  so in the taste department i thinks it s pretty comparable according to the packaging  purina beneful original dog food is 100  complete and balanced nutrition with protein  beef   omega fatty acids and grains   however  since i know dogs are carnivores i expected meat to be in at least one of the first four ingredients and they were not  the first four ingredients in order are ground yellow corn  chicken by product meal  corn gluten meal  whole wheat flour   beef happens to be seventh in the ingredients list each serving contains crude protein 25 crude fat 10 crude fiber 4 moisture 14  linoleic acid 1 5 calcium 1 1  iron 175 mg kgselenium 0 2 mg kgvitamin a 10 000 iu kgvitamin e 100 iu kgoverall  the dogs enjoyed this food   however  even though the package states it meets 100  of their nutritional needs  based on the first four ingredients and the misleading protein  beef  statement on the packaging i was left wondering  where s the beef    for this reason i give the product four stars as i do not think this is a nutritional powerhouse  my friend s 2 dogs and 5 shelter dogs ate this dog food eagerly,1,0
2385,the scent of this clear scalp therapy shampoo is very pleasing to me   it s subtly sweet but not overbearing  and it certainly doesn t smell very manly   which is good since i am not a man   it doesn t smell anything like other dandruff shampoos do the shampoo is a thick white cream that lathers quickly   it leaves a nice softness in the hair  which makes the hair easy to comb through afterwards   i gte no itchiness off of this product this shampoo came double wrapped in plastic and a small cardboard box   this is the only clear shampoo i received that came packaged this way   i noticed no leakage if only it weren t so expensive  another good clear product,1,0

2387,i m an evoo snob  i was introduced to corto olive oil and since trying that brand and tasting the flavor of california olives in this evoo no other has even come close to comparing  i was on my last few drops of corto and was truly sad because who can really afford to buy a  53 00 bottle of olive oil  i was in my local key foods and i stopped by the oils section and saw this bottle  it stuck out from the rest of the oils because it was in a small area  compared to the shelves and shelves of bertolli  etc  and it said  california olive  on it  i got excited    saw the price   7 99  i decided to give it a whirl  the second i opened the bottle    bam  the fragrant aroma that had once only been found from corto permeated the air  i froze    and did a taste  it is an exact replica of corto olive oil at a fraction of the cost  i don t think anyone can truly understand how excited  and how thrilled i am to have found this brand  well done c o r  you have a new loyal customer  best evoo,1,0

2393,i have had a horrible time with rabbits eating my plants so  even though rabbits weren t listed as an animal this repels  i figured i d give it a try   first  i watered everything and noticed as i watered that the ants had nested in my garden again   i have a horrible time with ants and  believe me  in the past  watering hasn t gotten rid of them at all   i put down the havahart critter ridder pretty thick and left everything   i came back two days later to water again and noticed the ants were gone   i m talking  not a single one   the only thing i did different was the critter ridder so  for now  i m going to give the credit there   it also appears to have stopped the rabbits because nothing was eaten down more than two days prior on a side note  i didn t read the container until after i sprinkled it all around my raspberry bushes   it is not to be used with food crops   oops   good thing we re in our first year of raspberry bushes and they aren t producing yet  seems to even work on ants ,1,0

2397,i m in the suburbs of chicago  and our area has a lot of possums and raccoons   some of those raccoons look like giant mutant ferrets  i m remodeling the house  and am away a week at a time  i ve occasionally found animal droppings around the foundation and under the deck  in the past i ve tried the commercial bottles of animal urine  really stinks  easy to spill  requires a lot   so i liked the idea of 1  pellets  2  ease of application  3  does not stink after spreading these around the perimeter with the handy dandy container design  and adding some to the fence where i thought the critters were entering  climbing over and digging under  i left for a week  no new signs of these foul critters  in other words  the little used side of my house  you know  where the a c sits along with little used hoses and the like  was poop free the stuff looks slightly oily  i assume from the black pepper oil  and smells like a day old cajun dinner  lots of spice  a little stale  the active ingredients are capsaicin  as in pepper spray and really hot spices   black pepper oil and piperine  piperine is responsible for pungency of black pepper  so when animals  with their super sensitive noses  smell this stuff  it chases them away  like pepper spray does  only this is passive there s also a decent amount  so i can apply several times  after heavy rain  a few weeks  etc   keeps the possums and raccoons away from my house,1,0

53,i drink tea 3 to 4 times per day  i prefer black tea in the mornings  especially earl grey  this is a rather bland earl grey tea by higgins   burke  this is the second tea i try by this brand  the first one was a green tea that was also bland i steeped the tea as directed directly into my mug  as mentioned it was very light in flavor and color  this might be a good thing for those that do not like strong teas  next time i made this tea i steeped it longer to attain the desired flavor  the tea was not very aromatic i was rather disappointed by the tea  especially when you consider the price  stash has a better tasting earl grey  somewhat bland,1,0
2399,my dogs gobbled the food up in no time  but honestly what animal will not eat a new kind of food that is placed in front of them that smells and looks like beef   it even states in the ingredients that natural filet mignon flavor is used   it looks appealing with dry kibble and some moist chunks  in the ingredients it states by  product poultry is used  but i like that fact that beef is the first ingredient listed which means it is he highest concentrated ingredient used i had previously purchased the ridiculously highly priced  organic  dog food  but after a recent very large recall of a well known dog food brand that has many labels  i switch to purina brands since they have never had a recall of dog food   they have had recalls of cat food but never dog food   however  for a 4 5 pound bag for a purina brand dog food you can buy anywhere i think it is a tad bit expensive i have been feeding my poochies purina beneful healthy weight  but i am going to mix things up and buy the large bag of purina beneful and a small bag of chef michael s and mix them up and feed them a smorgasbord every night  dogs gobbled it down ,1,0
2400,chef micheals grilled sirloin dry dog food rocks    it s catnip for dogs   i have two shitzus they won t stop eating it  i usually feed them imes but they seem to like this much better it does nt seem like the pieces are too large because they are chowin  down it must be the sirloin flavor  anyway if you have finicky dogs they will probably like it  i would give it a try  catnip for dogs     ,1,0
2401,came on time and look like rocks  have not eaten one yet so cannot comment on taste  but they look good  candy rocks,1,0
52,i also purchased this product in glass containers  it was a bit of a mess  mine wasn t as bad as some  but the bottle top broke  fortunately  no glass broke and not mush of the sauce was lost  that having been said  don t let bad packaging deter you from what i consider one of the perfect condiments around   not as hot as tabasco  but a similar taste  can t do that much hot  but i do dig the taste  so this is a very happy medium  but  so buy the plastic container if you can  the perfect food,1,0
2402,the fragrance helps not make the garbage can  a little more bearable  but i wish that they were a tad bit thicker so you did not have to feel the warmth and gooeyness of the dogs shit when you picked it up  always makes me squirm a little  what else can i say about a product that was made to pick up poo poo ,1,0
51,came as two 12 pack boxes  but i pretty much expected that   other than that  i now have 24 bottles of 5 hour energy  not sure what else i can say about this seeing as it s what i ordered  as advertised,1,0
2403,i eat this jam occasionally with peanut butter on crackers  and it is quite tasty  while it is less unhealthy than other sugary jams  i don t deceive myself that it won t raise blood sugar  because it is essentially 100  fructose  which is just as capable of raising blood sugar as sucrose  white table sugar   more on this below most people buy this product as a presumed health food due to it being lower in sugar than other jams  it s ingredients are   juice concentrate  pear  grape   strawberries  maltodextrin  dietary fiber   fruit pectin  citric acid  natural flavor   this product contains no artificial sweeteners  which are associated with various health hazards this product s primary claim to fame is that it is  as the label states   sweetened only with fruit juice   any jam will have its sweetener listed first  meaning that is its primary ingredient  if you are on a low carb diet or diabetic  you might want to know that this jam basically substitutes fructose for sucrose  since fructose is twice as sweet as sucrose  the producers only need to use half as much as they would have of sucrose  so it has about half the calories of regular jam   on the other hand  many cheap jams contain high fructose corn syrup  but that s another health issue entirely   the problem for many people is that they are used to the taste of sucrose  and 100  fructose tastes very different from a combination of fructose and sucrose which is the case with regular jam made with white sugar  to my own taste  since i m eating a fruit spread  it tastes quite sweet enough to me the fruit pectin in this product is a standard thickener in jellies and jams and its own natural form of fiber  so i am not sure why the company decided to add in maltodextrin and call that  fiber  too  anyone with a gluten intolerance should be wary of this product because of the maltodextrin since some people with gluten intolerance are getting sick from the maltodextrin in this jam  the producers claim on the label it is  gluten free   but maltodextrin can be made from either wheat or corn  and apparently this company is not being careful enough about contamination with gluten another ingredient that is problematic as to how healthy this product can be is the  natural flavor   it is possible that the producers add a strawberry extract so they can get away with using less real strawberries  which are more expensive than a flavoring  the definition of natural flavor under the code of federal regulations is   the essential oil  oleoresin  essence or extractive  protein hydrolysate  distillate  or any product of roasting  heating or enzymolysis  which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice  fruit or fruit juice  vegetable or vegetable juice  edible yeast  herb  bark  bud  root  leaf or similar plant material  meat  seafood  poultry  eggs  dairy products  or fermentation products thereof  whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional   21cfr101 22   that essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food  but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is  delicious taste  but you pay a premium to substitute fructose for sucrose,1,0
2392,i have not had very many espresso drinks so i do not have the palate to determine if it is a traditional flavor or not   i found the taste pleasant   not too strong and not overly sweet   my husband had a sip and hence the title of my review   i would gladly purchase this product to keep in the house or to have on trips   do not think i will find it in grocery aisle at my local store  not bad  pretty good    ,1,0

2115,personally i enjoy coffee drinks from local stores and even canned drinks  so when i ordered this one i had high hopes  sadly i wasn t as excited about it as i thought i would be  the drink is ok and in a pinch will satisfy a craving but overall if i had other choices i would not choose this one  i was hoping for something better,1,0
2055,this is pretty decent tasting coffee for the price  the only issue i had was i was using in my reused k cups and a new my k cup holder and the small grind cause the water to clog up and overflow  the solution i had to do is first put in normal ground coffee half way up the k cup and finish with the melita  coffee with a small grind ,1,0
1835,i understand what the reviewer was concerned about  the aroma of the truffles definitely comes through  i used them on some pasta  pizza  and a couple of soups  it s decent  especially for the price tag however  like the other reviewer said  the butter itself is not actually butter  it s under the category of margarine i think  it didn t bother me  because the way i was using it guess  cheap and not too bad,1,0
1836,for sure  do not buy your poppy seeds in the supermarket any more         you will get ripped off for the amount of what is in the little jars and the price   you cannot beat thus price and quantity        trust me                   wow,1,0

1839,kadoya sesame oil is a very good and tasty sesame oil  very dark in color and full of sesame flavor  i highly recommend this product  kadoya sesame oil,1,0
270,i found these to have a good mozzarella taste but they still retained that distinctive cheese it cracker taste underneath which i liked  everyone is going to have a different opinion on them so why not get a box and see for yourself  i did notice that msg is listed in the ingredients  i don t believe that original cheese its have it so that is something to keep in mind  overall a good product that i like and will purchase in the future i d also like to note that mine were shipped smart post and i wouldn t recommend picking the cheapest shipping option when ordering  by the time the cheese its got to me i d say that only 1 3 of the box was whole crackers  the rest were broken down into a fine crumb mess  the box didn t look badly beat up  so i don t know what the post office does but it is definitely detrimental to the cheese its  mix up your cheese it flavors now and then ,1,0
1842,gives me the boost i need to get through the afternoon  drowsies   i used to take nodoz pills  5 hour energy shots  rock star energy shots  and even liquid caffeine  no kidding     it really was just straight liquid caffeine that you put into your own drink   this has allowed me to get off of all of them without the unpleasant side effects  including crashing later and belching  i m perfectly willing to admit that 80  or more of the effect is psychological  one time  i grabbed a bottle and almost immediately felt peppier  then i realized i had set the bottle on the desk and didn t drink it   so  read all the good reviews  convince yourself it will work     and chances are  it will i don t care if it s just a placebo    it works for me and i subscribe to monthly shipments of two cases so i can have one a day and not run out  could be placebo effect  but who cares ,1,0
1843,first  let me say that this is not a bad product  and extremely reasonable at the price  our local pet store sells single bully sticks of this size for minimum of  5 6 each all that said  i believe anyone s level of satisfaction with this product will to some extend depend on how much experience one has had with bully sticks in general  and what you are using the basis for comparison i have two dogs  pitbull and lab mix  who are both seriously  accomplished chewers  over the last 7  years i have spent what amounts to a small fortune on a variety of bully sticks from numerous different vendors  i am not adding it up because i think the total would scare me   anyway i digress one of these keeps my dogs occupied for at  most 15 minutes  i have given them other sticks that lasted 2  3x as long  but again at double the price  a couple of other points to note  especially if you re new to the world of bully sticks these are not odor free  not that they claim to be   but be warned  they be stinky take it from an old hand here  store these in a ziplock bag that seals  the packaging that they are sold in will not suffice  trust me on this one  reallyin my experience if i need something that is going to last for awhile  i m usually better off going to an online merchant who specializes and sells different sizes and shapes in bulk  they usually have deals if you buy a certain minimum amount also  no matter how safe they seem  don t leave dogs unsupervised  in or out of a crate when theyre chewing on one of these  not for the professional chewer in your life,1,0
1844,ok  i just bought this two days ago  but i ve tried other amazing grass products so i m going with five stars   i was using orac  but was desperate for a new flavor   this one tastes grassy   of course it does   what would you expect   it s not bad   i ve mixed it with juice and i plan on mixing it with a smoothie soon   that may make it taste better   be aware it s not something you want to sip with your morning cereal   just knock it back and get it over with   the benefits totally outweigh the flavor   give it a try  amazing,1,0
1846,this is my second time ordering from amazon  i love the fact that my machine is already in one piece  i am just having issues with the stand it seems as if i am missing a piece from my stand  i can see on the computer that it looks like its a black flat piece holding the bottom of the machine and that is what i am missing    what do i need to do  or is there a number i can call please help  i need some feedback  i was really exicted i have got my stuff before the date  just having missing equipment is making this harder than i think  bubble machine single stand vending machine,1,0

269,i m enjoying this blackening seasoning   the taste is just right  not too strong or weak and not too hot   i like that there is no salt so i can control the saltiness  particularly when i use this along with other seasonings that do have salt i plan to buy again   when i use up this gigantic bottle    good flavor,1,0
1848,in the last couple of months  my 4 5 year old maltichon decided to be extremely particular about the food he ate  i went through several high grade kibble and wet food  natural balance acana california natural  but he refused to eat it  ultimately  he went on a food strike and started to lose weight  i went back to researching food and found this on amazon  i figured i had nothing to lose  my dog wasn t eating much already  when i introduced the honest kitchen  he sniffed  licked and then proceeded to inhale like he hadn t eaten in weeks  which he hadn t  he is now finally starting to gain back some of the weight he had lost while on his food strike  just about the only thing he hates about this food is having to wait the 5 minutes for it to rehydrate  food even the pickiest dog would eat,1,0
1849,i finally received the color that i ordered   there was a mixup on the seller s end  but they didget right on it and send out the right color   i have not used it yet   i bought it for special cupcakesfor an event in a few days  i ll add to the review when we have actually used the product i did want to mention  though  for those who think this might be a really great deal   the bottleyou see in the photo is not the bottle you are purchasing  you are getting one of the very small  under 3  tall drop bottles  not one of the large ones shown in the photograph  i wanted to point that out  because for people whoare only looking at the photos  it is misleading  not sure why some sellers feel the need to be sneaky  buti guess they try for more sales that way i ll be back to review the actual gel once we are done with the project just don t expect the big bottle when you purchase from this listing update well  i am now a huge fan of the gel coloring it worked like a dream  gave us a beautiful frosting that looked like black leather  but soft  no purples or blues  no weird shades   just great color now i will probably have to get more colors  because with these  i might start decorating cupcakes again i am adding a photo of our cookout cupcakes that we used the frosting for    it all looked great  be aware that the photo is not what you will get,1,0

271,i was pleased with the flavor and ease of use of the gluten free bisquick   i made a pizza crust with it  and it was pretty tasty   i used the recipe from the betty crocker gluten free cookbook   the crust was golden brown with a little crunch to it   my teenager even finished off the last two pieces that i had been looking forward to eating when i got home from mass   he normally won t eat anything gluten free that i make unless it s cake   i was very disappointed with the amount of time it took the vendor to get me the product though   it took just over of 2 weeks   i will look for another vendor from now on  love the product  but it took way too long to get it,1,0
268,i had been buying the scented bags for the past several months because they were longer than the unscented bags  the unscented bags used to be longer  too    unfortunately  bags on board has gotten cheap with all of their bags now  as the last batch of scented bags is now shorter  too   too bad   it used to be a 5 star product for me  now only 4 stars   note to manufacturer   please go back to the original  longer bags  these bags are short now  too ,1,0
1852,not a bad tea  just nothing special  i like to add mint and agave syrup to it to enhance the flavor  ok tea,1,0
1853,i love this product  the texture is different than similar ones i have tried   unique because these are nice and crunchy  but almost melt in your mouth  satisfies me the way candy or chips would  but are better because pineapple is so much healthier  this was the first time i ordered these from amazon  i ordered the three pack and two out of three were great  but one package had a hole in it and the pineapple was too chewy and actually un edible   unfortunately  amazon does not accept returns on this product  tasty healthy snack  but if damaged unable to request return,1,0
265,i like that it is vegetarian and low sodium  it is not salty and has a very bland taste which taste like vegetable powder  it is great as a filler or soup base  great soup base,1,0
1855,i received this yesterday  and just tried it this morning  i mixed one scoop with approx 12 oz of cherry juice   it wasn t too bad  it kind of tasted like fruity seaweed  luckily  i like the taste of seaweed   i ll probably try it in a smoothie tomorrow  my first day,1,0
1856,we just received  july 10  2012  a shipment of the dark roast pods from amazon after not being able to get them for the last several months   the site still says  out of stock   but i think if you place an order they ll start catching up to demand in a little while   many thanks to the person who wrote the review explaining the move of production facilities we tried a mr  coffee keurig style machine while we were unable to get senseo  but couldn t find any coffee as good as the douwe egberts pods we re very please to see the return of the senseo dark roast pods  and i hope that my subscription for the french vanilla pods will also be available again soon  they re back ,1,0
264,the ingredients in this product are obviously the attraction   organic pears  broccoli  spinach  ascorbic acid  vitamin c    one thing i liked  and i assume it is because the product is natural and not soaked with preservatives  but the package we received expired within a few weeks of us receiving it   i don t think it was old  maybe someone else can tell me the normal shelf life for this product   but i never feel good about food that seems to never spoil   twinkies all of the good things aside  if baby won t eat it  it doesn t matter what is in the package   baby loved it   she loved it so much that i even tasted a little   it gave me a slight pucker  but generally sweet and aside from baby food slimy  i would have eaten it too the pouches are cool   i buy applesauce for my older son in pouches like that and he drinks right out of them   for baby however  that won t work we don t microwave anything  so never an option for us   however  even if it was an option  it isn t one for these pouches   but why would anyone go organic and then microwave the life out of the food anyway   so i find the microwavability a non issue a bit pricey  but worth it  baby loved it ,1,0
1857,during the last recall  not the 1st for them  i bought this and like it better then csfdls  dogs like it and i feel better with a product that has not been recalled  quality control and poor custome service during the recall lost me and this dog food fits the bill and is about same price  thanks  switched from chicken soup 4 dog lovers soul,1,0
1858,i too purchased this product thinking it might not be a flavored product  and before it arrived i looked it up to see that there was some rumor as to a coconut flavor so  lets get this out of the way           do not purchase this is you do not like flavored coffee  it is flavored the first thing you notice is a deep coconut aroma  almost akin to hazelnut in its presentation  the initial mouthfeel is good  a light roast but a snappiness to the roast which settles in nicely with the flavor  whichhas a definite dark chocolate taste without the bitterness the finish is semisweet chocolate  jamaican coffee and faint toasted coconut bottom line  if you like flavored coffee with coconut hazelnut cocoa profiles  you will like this coffee  good  if you like flavored coffee,1,0
1859,this is partly my fault  i shouldve read the description more carefully  however  the picture is very misleading  i thought i was getting a pack of 4 small lollipops instead of 1 large one needless to say  i was extremely disappointed when i thought i ordered 4 packs of 4   expecting 16 lollipops  to bring to relatives abroad but only received 4 single ones otherwise  the lollipop itself is very cute  they came quickly  and were well packaged for shipping  1 lollipop not 4 ,1,0
1860,just bought this when we ran out of our usual blue brand  i want to keep our dogs on salmon instead of chicken  accidentally bought the puppy food but our guys just go crazy after it  no reason not to keep them on it  we just cut the portion down slightly  i ll switch to the adult if i notice any undesired weight gain  very pleased so far     dogs love it,1,0

262,first off i am not sure what people expect  this fr vanilla cap has a great taste  creamy texture and needs nothing added to it but again  i read the product info and it stated  sugar sucralose blend i use splenda brand sucralose anyway in my coffee  if you do not like the artificial sweetener  then do not order this product  but do not vote it down because you didn t read the info and or sucralose leaves an after taste i have no after taste from it and therefore i enjoy this product very much i use this in the b60 keurig on the middle setting  8oz if i remember correctly my pros  good price creamy texture tastes greatwill buy againfor people with the dopey comments let me add  it is machine made cappuccino  what do you think a cheap keurig is  gourmet coffee  great tasting and good price,1,0
260,these packets are easy to use   loved that   used them at a fundraising event   however  i had no way to gauge how many servings each packet makes   i would have appreciated some information about that on the amazon page and on the packets themselves  i ordered 4 boxes and am stuck with 3 5 boxes that cannot be returned  easy to use   could use better labeling,1,0
266,my dogs favorite dry food is the cats leftover science diet  if she can get it  so i m not too sure about her street creds when it comes to choosing dog food  however she likes the purina beneful original dog food  for the time being  any dry food she doesn t turn her nose up at is a plus the bag shows chunks of real beef and veggies as well as a picture of the actual food  i don t think a reasonable person would expect to pour out actual beef chunks any more then they would expect to pour a fully frosted cake   like the one on the front of the box  from a box of cake mix  the product page and the back of the bag give the ingredients   i sort of question the addition of sugar and i suppose the color is for the benefit of the owner but  from what i ve read  the chicken byproducts   feet  neck etc  are good for the dog  no animal  waste  can be used  the word  meal  means the byproduct is received in a dry state instead of a wet state i think the bottom line is do you trust the reputation and integrity of the manufacturer  it s probably not gourmet food but do you trust them to put out a healthy product  do you believe they get their ingredients from a reputable company and run all the required salmonella and bacterial tests  since i m no expert on dog food that s what i have to do  not cat food but my dog likes it anyway,1,0

272,considering this is suppose to be a healthier cereal i guess the amount of sweetness is sufficient  personally  i would like it to be a little more sweet  once i began eating the cereal  i forgot it was suppose to have a cinnamon flavor to it  so  if you are expecting a good  strong cinnamon flavor from this cereal you are going to be disappointed  other than those two disclaimers  the cereal was quite satisfying  it didn t get too soggy from the milk  i did get a hearty feel from it  i would say it is one of the better cereals out there if you are looking for a healthier cereal  could use more cinnamon,1,0
284,if you want to make fruit tarts  or german  torts    this is the glaze to get my german friend says the  torts  are very common in germany  like apple pie in the states for first time success  put the sugar in a dry saucepan and mix the glaze powder thoroughly with it before adding the water  i use 1 4 cup sugar instead of the tablespoon indicated on the package pour the glaze quickly after cooking  with a small stream aimed at each piece of fruit to cover all of them completely don t plan to keep these long  the fruit colors bleed into the glaze over a couple of days  so they look much better soon after completion  refrigeration is nice  but unnecessary good stuff  nothing else like it,1,0

282,there have been studies on cherry juice and athletic performance so i thought i ll give it a personal test  unfortunately i ve become unemployed so my training and competition had to stop cause i can t afford the cost that is associated with the training and the competition i ve only consumed the juice for three weeks before stopping training so i can t make a judgement on the effectiveness as a sports performance supplement  i can  however  say that the taste of this juice is pretty good  since i stopped training the taste has become too sweet so i have to add 25  water to dilute it before i can stomach it  it is not tart and if you like the taste of cherry you ll probably like this juice  just a bit too sweet,1,0

1810,i have been successfully using havahart do64ms deer off ii for a couple of months to ward off the squirrels  raccoons and cats that were plaguing my garden   when i ran out of that product  i decided to try the granular havahart critter ridder 3146 animal repellent this product is granular and you just shake it around areas you wish to protect   a single application is supposed to last 30 days  but in central florida we do get a lot of afternoon thunderstorms  so i find that i have to reapply the product after a heavy rain as with the deer off ii  this product is nearly as effective   the liquid solution seems to be a greater deterrent for my animal pest situation  but the granular repellent does seem to work for squirrels and raccoons   for some reason  the cats still want to use my flower beds as a litter box when i use the granules but they tend to avoid the area when i use the liquid overall   the granular shaker seems easier to shake into flower beds and vegetable gardens   i think the shaker is less obtrusive than the spray   i was hesitant to spray my tomato plants with the spray but i have no issues shaking the granules   i like that this product is omri listed  so no worries with using it in an organic garden the only thing i don t like about critter ridder products is the price   it is somewhat expensive  but the price you pay for this product is  hopefully  recouped if your garden is not destroyed by animals   i recommend the product   it did work for me   however  i can t speak for all situations   i think it is definitely worth a try if you want to rid your yard of critters  helped me rid my garden of squirrels and raccoons,1,0
1811,update  i received my second order of koyo rice cakes and am disappointed  some of the rice cakes have mold and smell bad  they are inedible  i will no longer buy grocery items from amazon com  i haven t experienced problems with this brand before  i believe there is something wrong with amazon s warehouse and shipping department i really like the koyo brand rice cakes  they are organic  gluten free  and low calorie  other brands of rice cakes are too dense and often processed on same lines as corn  sugar  etc  i ve reacted badly to some rice cakes because of cross contamination  the koyo brand is excellent  and amazon did a fantastic job with packaging and delivering  organic  gluten free  and low calorie ,1,0

1814,i love calypso lemonades  especially the strawberry and ocean blue but i would have to be a fool to order them for 60  dollars when i can buy the same 12 pack at the corner gas station for  20   i went on line hoping to find a better price than the  1 69 i was paying   this is not a good deal unless you are paying  5 12 a bottle don t be a fool,1,0
278,i refuse to compare this product to something like a fruit and cereal bar   it is a health food bar and  lets face it  most of those are horrible   i will agree that the banana and chocolate flavors don t really come out and there is a hint of a burned flavor  but all in all  i found them to be okay   compared to other health food bars  they were pretty good   i actually really liked the texture   they were filling  fairly low calorie  and pretty healthy   i went through the whole box in a few days and didn t share any with my kids  so that is saying something  not too bad for health bars,1,0
1816,it actually does taste really good  moreover  after exercizing  i ate about a handfull  dry  without water  filled me up immediately  which is the important thing for me is that the fiber functions as it is supposed to  kashi s cereals didn t cut it for me in that respect  as much as i love the idea of the protein   fiber combo that they ve got out at the moment one person posted a lot about hcfc in this product  which is a concern for me too  but here s my perspective as someone who stays away from hcfc 99  of the time when i have a choice just to point out  there s 10 grams of fiber per serving and 6 grams of sugar  that means there s only 4 grams net carbs per serving  a single serving can  12oz  of regular coca cola has 39 grams of sugar   and even that overload is  only  13  of one s daily carb intake  technically   a serving of this cereal has 80 calories and only 4 grams of net carbs  plus when i just bought a box in my local store i didn t see hcfc on the label   i looked for that specifically  so it is possible that kellog s has changed the formulation on this food  i laud your principled eating  ogo et al  but for those who can t afford  or are ignorant of  alternatives to this product  it is a favorable choice above raisin bran  for example  or another favorite among people i know  fiber plus  antioxidants  which has twice as much sugar and the same amount of fiber  all nutrition choices are individual  and peoples  needs and desires vary at the same time  i wholly agree that hcfc is a horrible  horrible substance  when choosing things to eat  i want to know if it s included  just the same as i want to know if aspartame is in my drink  however  my choice to consume this product is that of an informed consumer  i opt to purchase this product  5 boxes for less than  20 is the dealbreaker for me  a huge savings compared to other similar cereals such as kashi or my personal favorite  f factor skinnys  not available on amazon at the moment  about which i am sad   great ,1,0

1817,it really does melt in your mouth   it is so much lighter and more delicate than i expected  even given all the other reviews and descriptions   i ordered a small quantity  6 ounce jar  to see if i liked it   i will be ordering a pound well in advance of finishing the jar   give this salt a try   you won t be disappointed  melts in your mouth,1,0
1819,i love lapsang souchong tea   if it doesn t taste and smell like a campfire  my wife says probably combined with old socks  i m not interested   taylor s always tastes the same from lot to lot   my wife doesn t drink lapsang  so i keep my private stash in a double layer ziplock bag  one bag inside the other and squirrel it away where it won t be disturbed  the extra effort to keep it fresh really makes a difference   i drink several other teas  so i don t go through a box of anything very quickly  but when nothing will do but a decent smoked tea  taylor s works for me if i was a pasha and had unlimited funds  every cup of tea i drank would be made from a just opened box  it makes that much of a difference the first taste of tea for many people turns them off because it s probably a box of lipton or tetley  friends don t let friends drink nothing but orange pekoe  that has been in the cabinet since the titanic went down   not a good first impression if i m using one of the giant sized mugs  i put two bags in  not one  a good rich flavor taylor s is consistent  a very big deal for me  some other brands are not ps  i know loose tea is  better   but i m lazy  a consistantly decent lapsang,1,0
1820,i m looking forward to using this trap on a illusive mole that i just can t kill  i haveuse repellants  poisoned peanuts and a spike trap by sweeney that was worthless     so i put my trust into the reviews here and to the youtube videos on this trap      i ll post an updated review soon  looking forward to using ,1,0
1821,i have been eyeballing this stuff online for a while  peanut butter that is not only low cal and low fat  but also organic   a dream come true  but  really  i couldn t justify spending  15 for a little jar  i was happily surprised to see this at a local grocery store chain called reasor s  it was  7 29 for the little jar and i bought it   if i see it on sale  i will buy all the jars it tastes good like a very natural tasting jif  i like it stiffer so i use less water than the directions call for  also  because of the lower fat content  it washes very easily  no more gross peanut butter knives in the sink  awesome  but pricey,1,0
1822,my cats love this stuff  but i kept having trouble with auto ordering   also once i got a case that had a few rotten packets in it  i had to throw away the whole box the packet was in and they would not give a refund   after the rotten packet i switched to tiki cat which is healthier and more natural  okay,1,0
1823,i have two very picky cats  one has serious food allergy issues  so i ve been trying out new foods  my cat with allergies loves this food  and it fortunately does not make him sick  the other cat  unfortunately will barely touch this food  he seems to like the smell  but he s really a dry crunchy food addict  the texture of this food is a bit odd  it comes in small flat squares that are dry  but a bit more like jerky than normal dry cat food  not tough like jerky  that s just the closest thing i can compare it to  i suppose you could even compare it to a chopped fruit roll up  made with meat puree instead of fruit   this food wasn t a complete winner for us  but it works for one cat at least  kiwipeak lamb,1,0
1824,i have a toy party poodle  he usually eats beneful healthy weight  but i ve noticed he really eats the soft pieces and leaves the hard ones  i guess for when he is starving  he is 8yrs old and when i got him he was 4 and overweight  the previous owners fed him kibbles   bits  anywhoo  i m not a really good pet parent  i don t read lables  etc and i don t know what it s made from  he doesn t have nay health problems that we are aware of so i guess it s pretty good for a dog food   i have seen and smelled worse he eats this just like he does the healthy weight  no big difference  i think he will eat just about anything  but if you check my reviews you will see what he really goes crazy over  and for the sake of him not bouncing off the walls all day and getting into trouble  i only give that sparingly  mickey likes it ok,1,0
277,my everlasting quest to find cheap and healthy dog treats has eventually lead me to this brand   i have yet to find any healthy treats cheaper than this when looking at a cost ounce comparison   it s made in the usa  which is a necessity   i refuse to buy any dog treats from china  and so should you   i used to buy the waggin train brand until i researched it   please research your dog treats i would say these fall somewhere between a hard and soft treat   they are not chewy  but will not crumble when you break them   i usually break them in half so the bag lasts longer   my lab likes them  but i wouldn t say they are his favorite   he will sometimes turn these down if he has a more desirable toy in his mouth   this is the only reason i m giving these 4 stars instead of 5   i do plan to try the other flavors to see if he likes them better  great deal,1,0
1825,i recently received a sample of this cookie  and i enjoyed it   the cookie was soft and not too dry   it was a little spicier than i generally like my oatmeal cookies  but it definitely had some flavor  i wouldn t say that it s my favorite oatmeal cookie ever  but i would be very okay with eating more of them     soft and flavorful cookie,1,0
274,very satisfied with sunbutter  we use as a peanut substitute  we can t tell the difference between it and peanut butter  i saw one review that said it didn t taste like peanut butter  i don t understand they must have gotten a bad batch or something  sunbutter,1,0
1828,i am a coconut water aficianado if not connoisseur and this product tastes better than almost every other one i have tried with the possible exception of nirvana in the glass bottles   why   it has to be the quality of the coconuts   when i say taste better  this has the solid finish of higher quality produce  like a fine wine   it doesn t go down a little sour  like most coco water  reminding some faintly of urine  unfortunately  but it has a nice robust coco nutty finish that just tastes fabulous   this is the real deal   imagine how good it would taste in a glass bottle   the analogy i would use is that harvest bay is to most coco water as fresh squeezed unpasteurized oj is to store bought pasteurized oj   enjoy  why this  tastes better than zico or vita coco,1,0
1829,the chips taste fabulous as always  but it s unfortunate i have to mail order them since they arrived crumbled in small pieces   they appeared to be packed well  but i guess being tossed around in the mail is unpreventable   wish my local groceries still carried them     crumbled,1,0
1830,i ve tried a lot of other coconut oil brands before trying this one and i wasn t used to how it had almost no discernable coconut scent  unless you are using this to lightly steam or bake something  it really doesn t compare to other regular coconut oil brands in terms of that fresh and sweet taste if this is your first time using coconut oil  you probably won t care since there is no basis for comparison  but  if you are used to using other brands like barlean s  nature s way  or vitacost s brands of coconut oil  you may or may not like how this has barely any scent  this is probably due to the fact that this oil is raw  it hasn t been treated with heat  so the oil s untoasted coconut scents won t carry over as strongly as one that has been heated to  200 degrees f that can carry the toasted coconut scent into the oil more strongly  barleans  natures way  and aunt pattys are all organic  cold pressed  and extra virigin  only aunt patty s is raw  thus  the lack of that fresh sweet coconut taste that is amazing just on its own as a spread or sauce so  i d recommend this brand for light stir frys  steaming  light baking  since the faint tasted will still carry over a bit  or as part of a raw diet  i would not recommend raw coconut oil for using as a sweet paste  melted gravy  syrup for desserts  waffles  for heavy coconut scent sauces  or if you want the heavier coconut scents for any recipe or skincare since raw coconut oil just doesn t have that strong sweet coconut taste that you d want in  say a spread so if you hate the smell and want something bland  or are on a raw diet  this will be great for you  if you love the addictive coconut scent and taste  you are better off buying one that isn t raw aunt patty s coconut oil or tropical traditions  both raw   however  aunt patty s comes in a glass jar  barlean s  nature s way  and vitacost s brands do not  five stars if you are looking for something raw  not packaged in plastic  and light or bland in taste  three stars if you are looking for a strong tasting coconut oil that you would buy over and over again  well  three stars plus one for packing it in a glass jar   it s raw,1,0
1831,your guess is as good as mine regarding what festival means when they claim that their canned shiitake slices are  fresh pack    on a separate subject   unlike mw polar brand of canned sliced shiitake  festival brand does not add sesame oil  which would make the mushrooms taste better but at the expense of adding unwanted calories from the  bad  polyunsaturated fatty acid  linoleic acid  omega 6   which is the only kind of polyunsaturated fat contained in sesame oil  festival doesn t tell us what they mean by  fresh pack ,1,0
1832,this product was wonderful as described   my problem was the packaging and delivery  there was no where marked on the package that this was chocolate and should be kept cool   it was delivered to my home mailbox on the hottest day and sat in the mailbox for around 4 hours  it was completely melted but i put it in the refrigerator to solidify   i am able to eat it but instead of 2 disk there is just a solid piece of chocolate that is very hard to cut or break   i manage though and it is as good as the other reviews have stated   i was just so disappointed in how i received it  anticipation ,1,0
1818,this is a seriously good product   i live in a very rural area which is plagued by moles and pocket gophers  this year has been especially bad  as evidenced by literally hundreds of fresh soil mounds each week in my pasture and garden   like other reviewers  i tried a number of other products in an attempt to avoid the dreaded trap   and nothing worked   the gassers were useless  and although the poison was effective  i worried constantly about my dog and  for those who think poison is a nice and tidy solution   encountered trails of bloody mucus and entrails on my concrete walkways as evidence of what must have been a prolonged and horrific death enter the black box   first  i want to make the point that i m a woman  a bit squeamish  actually  a lot squeamish when it comes to things rodent   and i have no mechanical aptitude at all   i was absolutely sure that i was not going to be able to set the trap  or that i would lose a few fingers trying  and was similarly certain that i would not catch anything   stuff like this just doesn t work for me well  to my amazement  i had an instant success   it couldn t have been more than three or four hours after i  successfully  set the trap that i had snagged my first mole   and i have been trapping them daily every since let me begin by stating that there is nothing at all difficult about setting this trap   it sets just like a mouse trap  but with two important exceptions   first  the metal arm that holds the spring loaded killing bar down is very easy to set in place and  unlike a mouse trap  does not tend to spring loose while you re setting it   second  the killing bar is inside the box  so even if the bar were to snap back while you re setting the trap  your fingers would not be in harm s way   yes  it takes considerably more muscle to set than a mousetrap  but it is nothing that this 120 pound woman can t easily do   i use one foot to help  and i can set the thing in a matter of seconds   no sweat finding the tunnel and placing the trap has been a no brainer   i simply dig a hole where the mound is  then feel around its sides with a gloved hand to locate the tunnel opening   once located  i scoop out the loose dirt to clear a good sized opening  then butt the trap right up against the tunnel opening   other reviewers have stated that they pack dirt tightly around the sides of the trap  but i ve had equally good luck simply setting the trap in the hole and covering the hole with a piece of heavy cardboard  making sure that no light comes through around the edges    normally  within a half day i have either caught something or the trap has been packed with dirt by a mole or gopher trying to close off the tunnel   in the latter event  i simply reset the trap and try again   baby carrots stuck part way into the air hole do seem to improve the chances of success disposal of dead catch has not been all that bad   i dig a grave  and  using the toe of my boot to hold the bar down  simply knock the dead critter into the hole with a trowel   don t have to touch anything in summary  this product really works   the only criticism i have is that the instructions on the box are not at all helpful   however  by reading the reviews on amazon  a first time user can get a complete how to and be up and running in minutes   the poor instructions notwithstanding  i give this product five stars  seriously good product,1,0
1866,we carefully followed the directions and had great results for the first two uses  after that the machine began to fling melted clumps instead of floss  still a lot of fun  just needs to be cleaned while using  which means it has to completely cool  soak and scrub  kind of a bummer for the kids still waiting  better for small in home use  don t try for a party  needs cleaning after two batches,1,0
1867,we like this particular coffee the best  it isn t bitter and it does have a good taste  not real strong but not real weak either  i use the middle cup setting on the kuerig for this coffee unless i am adding ice then i will use the smallest because of the extra water the ice gives  or favorite,1,0
1868,i used it for a sinus infection where i lost my voice completely and had a sore throat  i found this product on yelp and went to an herbal asian store in chinatown in phila  i only paid  2 50  the only difference is that i didn t get tea bags they were dissoluble cubes you place in the hot water  it worked great  it took a few hours to work but it worked   the next day i had my voice back completely and no sore throat  one night i woke up from terrible post nasal drip cough  took a cup of this tea and it eliminated the cough and put me right to sleep  a must buy  its cheap and natural  you cant go wrong if you give it a try  great stuff,1,0
1903,anyone notice that kashi golean just lost some weight   new box size is 13 1oz rather than 14 1oz guess they figured 7 1  decrease in size would be more economically friendly than a 7 6  price increase  the math here is a bit tricky but this is the true increase in price   8 29 12  price has returned back to old price  new smaller size but same price,1,0
252,i ve just ordered this   it will be interesting to see what weight of tea  exactly  it is that i ll receive   i ll follow up after i get my order the large print says 3 pounds   product details says shipping weight  9 3 ounces,1,0
251,i didn t know what to expect when i got this tea  after my first cup i sort of turned my nose up  it was a taste i wasn t familiar with and i didn t think i liked it  but when i was a little girl my mother used to tell me to try something three times  before i made up my mind that i didn t like it i think the first time i heard that was when she gave us  four girls and one boy  spinach for the first time  well it was canned   i really didn t like that  didn t like it the second time either  but the third time i heaped butter on it and liked it a lot so  i tried it again and i liked it a little better  then i thought back and remembered the above spinach story and remembered what the butter did for the canned spinach and i thought  why not try cream and boy of boy did that do it for me  delicious  so there you go  the third time was the charm for me  just like with the spinach  third time was the charm,1,0
250,i didn t used to like earl grey tea because the brand that i bought was very bitter  but this higgins   burke earl grey is excellent  it has a very nice light citrusy aroma  but the bergamot flavor is not overpowering  the tea is not bitter and does not leave an aftertaste i left one teabag in the cup for more than 3 minutes and the tea was still very smooth    even without adding milk or sugar  this is excellent as a hot tea  and even when it cools to room temperature it is still flavorful  the tea lacks the sharp astringency that some other brands of earl grey have  so i think it would make a very mild iced tea  although i have not tried it on ice  if you like tea but don t want the harshness associated with some brands  try this one  earl grey as it should be,1,0
1904,i just ordered this 4 days ago and it arrived today  i have only tried the carmel so far and it s delicious   these package are advertised as  mini cones  but  for my money these are not mini  they are big  i thought i would have to eat 4 packs in order to get a decent serving  but one pack is plenty   but   i was supposed to receive 10 of each zebra chocolate  carmel  kettle and cheese  i didn t get any zebra chocolate and i m pretty upset about that  if there was a problem with the order and they couldn t fulfill it then they should have let me know i emailed the seller so  now i guess i ll just wait and see if they make this right  the best popcorn ever   ,1,0

1908,my 8 year old cat is one of the fussiest eaters on the planet  she will not even touch a food if she sniffs it and decides she doesn t like the smell of it  i have tried the tactic of just leaving it out and not giving her any other options for food and she just ends up starving  she has been eating a cheap brand of dry cat food with ingredients that i now know are just horrific for cats her whole life  the first five ingredients were brewer s rice  chicken by product meal  corn meal  chicken fat and soybean meal  as you can probably see  this is a food i was desperate to get her off of  she has also been a very skittish cat and would often have anxiety attacks about seemingly nothing  like  at the very slightest noise she would literally jump 4 feet in the air from fear and if you were near her or touching her when it happened she would unintentionally scratch you to ribbons in her mad dash to get away  i was sad when this happened because normally she is such a gentle cat and has never bit me in her life  there is no way she would scratch unless she was terrified and completely out of her mind  i had an inkling that the junk food might be exacerbating this problem  much like how gluten and dairy could exacerbate the problems of autistic children all of my attempts up until now have ended up in failed attempts and money wasted on food she wouldn t eat  this happened again and again and i almost thought it was a lost cause until holistic select chicken meal formula  we recently rescued a kitten off the streets and i knew i didn t want to start feeding her the same junk that my older cat had been eating for years  i was looking up some grain free formulas and decided to go with one of those brands since cats shouldn t really be eating grains  to make a long story short  both the kitten and cat didn t like it  the kitten will nibble on it if there are no other options  she s easier to please  thank goodness   so i ve kept it around and leave it out so there s something out when their other food is gone  but all in all  not a success by any means  i had a sample packet of holistic select chicken meal lying around that i received probably about a year ago and never got around to giving to my cat and the kitten got at it and bit away at the packaging to get the food inside  i looked at the ingredient list and hey  not too bad  i hoped beyond hope and offered some to my older cat and she eagerly ate it  hallelujah so i quickly bought a bag from amazon and prayed that she would continue eating it  well  i am now down to a quarter of the bag and i recently had to reorder  both of the cats eat it with no problems and my older cat actually has far less anxiety attacks  she seems much more calm and is now willing to let my husband come up to her without running away in fear  he can even pet her a little  this is a miraculous change than just a few months ago when the mere sight of him had her diving under the bed  i have recently been eating healthier and i know what a difference it makes for me and there is no difference with our pets  what we feed them has a drastic affect on their well being and behavior  this is not the absolute best food out there  but it s pretty darn good  i have recently ordered some wet food cans from holistic select since i know little kitten will go crazy over that and it s good to supplement the diet with some wet  a food that works for both new kitten and fussy adult cat,1,0
249,i have recently been reading about many of the benefits of dandelion tea   yes  including what dr  oz had to say about it as part of a weight loss regimen    thus  i decided to give it a try   and it s good   i think people say it has a coffee llike taste due to the roasted flavor that comes through   to me it definitely still tastes like a tea  albeit a roasted one   i say i was surprised how much i like the taste because  based on the smell of both the teabag and the brewed product  i thought it would be terrible   the smell is not good but the taste really is   i have had it both with 1 packet of truvia and with a packet of truvia   a small amount of creamer and both variations are great  was surprised how much i like the taste  ,1,0
248,this came in 2 pretty big jars   i opened one and it was completely white  after a week or so of using it  i saw small black patches of what looked like mold on the surface of the surface  so i scraped it off  but within a couple of days  it grew back  i thought it was disgusting  didn t want to throw such expensive oil away though  so i refrigerated it   when refrigerated  the oil is hard as a brick  it s really difficult to scrape out chucks for use   i mostly use this for pan frying eggs  veggies  meats  toast  etc  difficult to use ,1,0
1909,yes   quaker went back to the old recipe   woohoo   i do love this stuff   this maple brown sugar flavor is what i grew up eating   i am unfortunately a picky eater  nothing else will do  i m very sensitive to  and grossed out by  new flavors and textures a year or two ago quaker had scrapped the old recipe and came out with a new   improved recipe which i unwittingly tried and was repulsed  thinking i d gotten a bad batch until i realized it had been reformulated   the new version s hearty oats and natural flavor wasn t a hit with me   i emailed quaker with my complaint and they nicely sent me a  5 coupon to use on any quaker product which i used for life cereal anyway  i guess i wasn t the only one complaining about the new   improved recipe because now quaker has returned to their tried  n  true classic recipe   now i have my old maple brown sugar flavor and texture back   sure  it s probably not as healthy for me as old fashioned homecooked oats  but i don t like old fashioned oats       the flavor and texture of this instant oatmeal is comfort food to me  and since i have orthodontic braces  it s a good food for me to eat when my teeth are aching  the good ol  classic recipe that i grew up with,1,0
1910,after buying similar food markers from local stores to decorate cake pops  wasted      i ended up piping black frosting to decorate   i was wary buying these  since my initial purchase  i have since bought the multi color set twice and these even more times than that  they really work these markers decorate batches of cake pops without stopping  the other ones     i could maybe finish two individual pops before the markers clogged up  i use three different brands of candy melts and have never had problems with any  a homeschool co op class borrowed a set to decorate marshmallow lego pops for a special treat  and they worked well for me after 15  5 8 year olds used them  and not carefully   like any kid colors   well worth the money  these markers actually work   ,1,0
247,this sounds pretty awful  because it has  scotch bonnet  in the name  it makes you expect flaming hot ketchup you can barely eat  but that s wrong  it has a slight kick to it  but not enough to be a problem i love this stuff  the fattier the food  the better it goes with it  i eat it with mcdonald s breakfasts  it s wonderful needs bigger and better containers  way better than it sounds,1,0
1911,i stopped buying grocery store cat food after several experiences that happened nearly simultaneously  i learned what is contained in them  what is actually in fish meal  for example    i learned about other additives  that are not food  and how they effect an animals organs   i learned about the recall of foods from china killing pets nationwide  if not worldwide   i learned about the national recall lists of pet foods and all kinds of foods and products published online everyday of the week   so i made the switch to organics with ingredients labels that will make you smile instead of shutter   these foods are more expensive  but you love your pets so you ll be buying peace of mind and their continued health  a great healthy food  my cats love it,1,0
1902,my daughter loved these  i committed to not giving her wheat in the first year  that was hard to do  at the time i was buying these there were no wheat products in the ingredients   be aware that companies change their recipes all the time  if no wheat is your goal too be sure to double check the ingredients before purchase  these little puffs are great melt in baby mouth travel food  and the dog liked them  so i rarely ever found them on the floor   d no wheat ,1,0

1916,i felt that i had to give an update reassuring people a little more about this product   i can assure you that i have no connection or financial interest in this company or in regard to this himalayan salt the reason for my interest is that i have an autistic son  and i am very watchful for contaminants in his food  i avoid the type of sea salt from the ocean since heavy metal contamination is an problem   so when i found this himalayan salt  i was glad because the label states that they monitor the contents for contaminants   and it doesn t come from the ocean  which greatly reduces the likelihood of heavy  metal contamination one reviewer was quite concerned because there seemed to be some sediment left at the bottom of a glass of water when he attempted to dissolve the salt   he felt that this sediment was dangerous and not fit for human consumption so i did some research of my own   i tried to dissolve some of the salt in a glass of water also   i noticed that some of it did not dissolve immediately   it took a while  but eventually all but some red powder had dissolved   so i know that some of the salt dissolves immediately  some of it will dissolve after a lot of stirring and perhaps after it sits in the water for a couple of hours   but the red powder did not dissolve i looked up himalayan pink salt and found out that the bavarian consumer protection agency analyzed the composition of 15 himalayan sea salts sold in germany   they found that it was composed of 10 different minerals  including  of course  sodium and chloride  98     it contained 2 3  polyhalite or gypsum and 10 other minerals in small amounts gypsum is a very soft sulfate material made up of calcium sulfate dihydrate   i am assuming it is safe for consumption since it is used as a coagulant in tofu polyhalite is a hydrated sulfate of potassium  calcium and magnesium   it s reddish color is due to various levels of iron oxide in salt deposits this may seem alarming  but i did yet more research and found that insoluble minerals do not absorb and simply pass through the body  based on that information  i am not ready to assume that this insoluble mineral is harmful himalayan pink sea salt has been harvested from the salt mines in pakistan since the 13th century   so they ve been eating this stuff for a long time   and if they ve been consuming it for that long  and if that s the way it comes out of the ground  i think i can feel pretty good about it i am not 100  confident about my conclusions  but for now  i am feeling a bit better about serving this to my children rather than serving any other salt on the market  so far  it s the best salt i have found,1,0

1917,i m sitting here with the sprout holiday vegetable dinner package of baby food in hand and i don t know where the reviewer came up with the salt content   calories  140  total fat  4 grams  sodium  20mg  carbs  24 grams  sugars  4 grams  since there is 20 grams difference between the carbs and the sugars  this generally indicates there are no additional sugars added and what is there is from the natural sugar in the veggies  fiber  2 grams  protein 4 grams   in fact  i have looked at several of the sprout baby food packages and their sodium is quite low   i was in the middle of the ordering process to get this from amazon when the review caught my attention in regard to the sodium content and i had to comment  label information,1,0
243,this coffee is great  but honestly after a little searching the price here is ridiculous  i found this exact same product for about half the cost off another website  great coffee for double the price,1,0
242,flavor is pretty good  and the size of the bottle is very large  it can last at least a year for a person do not drink coffee every morning  like me  it does not look like half half in grocery store freezer  it is sticky liquid  it doesn t not require refrigerating  not sure why  does it not spoil  after 2 months the taste has not changed a bit  but i do not want to use it any more  not the product fault it does what it claims i guess  love the flavor,1,0
241,check your local grocery stores   mine   market basket   star mkt   has  em for as low as 2 for   3 on salethats way less than half this on line price   if not have your grocery manager order some for you no reason to pay double for these a good product indeed though  wickles for less  ,1,0

1920,i tried the 2 pack     very good lift  i would not say 5 hours of lift   maybe 3 thoughi like that they are all natural and with green tea  the extra vitamins are plus also andcelestial is good brand you can trust just a note if you just buy the 2 pack you need to buy 20 bucks worth of other stuff toget to the  25 bucks and get free shipping  the opposite of sleepy time  ,1,0
1921,the price point of this product makes it immediately attractive  it s only detractor  the labeling  fails to mention the various qualities that a health concious consumer needs to know when comparing the more expensive alternatives  after some research  a manager at the trader joe s bollinger helped unravel this dilemma by providing the following information  trader joe s coconut oil is  non hydrogenated  cold pressed  no heat is used at any time during the processing  raw filtered  unpasturized  and is strained  hope this helps  what s inside the jar ,1,0
1922,this may simply show that i was ignorant as to what a polish dill pickle would be  but i was expecting something closer to a kosher dill  like let s say what s produced by claussen or maybe vlassic  instead  these almost remind me more of a bread and butter pickle  sugar is used in the brine along with garlic and dill having said that for those that like a sweeter pickle instead of a more sour dill this would easily be a five star product  since it was my mistake to buy the wrong type of polish pickle i ll still rate this product 5 stars  what impressed me even more is that the only ingredents were the cucumbers  vinegar  water sugar  dill and whatever other spices were used in the brine  no preservtives were used at all  so for those wanting a true all natural product  this is it addendum   to clairfy  i looked up polish dill pickles on a couple sites  and i have to admit it was due to myself being clueless   there are some that are more like what i wanted  then some like this product   so  i should have researched the difference   i m going to raise the review to five stars since the mistake was all mine  i previously did have it at four stars  sweeter then i expected  great for people that enjoy a sweet dill pickle,1,0
1913,my kids love these steel cut oats  however  i recently became aware of the differences in labeling  these oats are being sold as  100  organic  when the actual labeling on the package is just  organic   there s a big difference  at least  in my opinion       100  organic vs  organic,1,0

1900,coffee preferences seem very personal and heated debates can erupt over the subject   for me  this coffee is very good   it s not too sweet    just the right amount of sugar   the taste was rich with no strange or bitter aftertaste   there was also no  burnt taste  that i ve experiences with other brands   regarding other reviewers who complain about a strange acidic or a citrus taste  i couldn t taste anything funny like that   be aware that the product contains a preservative named potassium citrate  an odorless but not a tasteless chemical   the vast majority of people have no problem with the chemical but there are a few where it hits the taste buds in an unpleasant way   you d probably know by now if you were in that minority because this preservative is common note that i like cold coffee so i poured the room temperature can into a glass with ice   thus i was tasting something slightly diluted  and yet it still tasted great   i also should say that i am not a huge coffee drinker  but i do like coffee candy and coffee ice cream bottom line  if i was in a store or on amazon and wanted to buy some espresso style cans of this size  i would either pick this brand or starbuck s brand depending on which one was cheaper   they both taste very good   if the prices were equal  i would probably go with this brand just to give myself more long term taste test with the product  went down smooth,1,0
1899,i was so excited to find xylitol confection sweetner but i wish there was stevia in it instead of sucrolose  it would then be more natural products especially for diabetics and health food nuts like me  replace sucralose,1,0
1869,i looked for a protein powder with a good dose of fiber  low sugar  and at least 8 g of protein   when i opened the canister and saw green powder  i doubted i would like the flavor   it turned my peach smoothie horribly green   however  it s actually quite tasty   i m also impressed by how filling it is  i don t get hungry before lunch  better than expected,1,0
1870,i have been unable to find whole nutmeg in any grocery in my  hood at the end of the earth   i thought the price was more than reasonable for a package  but i incorrectly assumed  because i did not read well  that i would be getting about 12 whole nutmegs  instead of 12 packages of 4 6 nutmegs each   thankfully this product will last forever if kept in a cool dry place  i will be sharing with my friends  since i don t believe i could even finish 2 packages by the end of my life  the taste supersedes any of the ground product i have purchased  great deal,1,0

1873,arisana raw unrefined organic coconut oil is definitely one of the best i ve had  although comparable to any other raw organic unrefinded coconut oil  the current price is outrageous   15 99 lb   it was  9 99 just a few months ago at whole foods  i simply will not pay 60  premium for no reason  especially when large 2 5 3 pound coconuts are only  1 25 at the local asian marketplace   shop elsewhere unless you want to blow your money  great coconut oil   outrageous price,1,0
259,i was not sure what the product would taste like  since it had to be ordered  and i was looking for natural fruit that i could enjoy and would be like a  melt in your mouth  type of dried fruit  this product was excellent in what i was wanting and the taste was just as awsome  i would let anyone know that if they are looking for a dried fruit with all the natural taste of fruit  this is it  i have never had a problem with any orders from amazon just what i wanted,1,0
1874,i am currently nursing twin girls and have had quite a few bumps along the way   i guess you could say it was the perfect storm for something to go wrong   nursing multiples  returning to work full time and having babies that slept through the night wrecked havoc on my body   when they were 3 1 2 months old  i developed a blocked milk duct on one breast  which led to a milk blister   i did all kinds of research online and did everything i was supposed to do  compresses  massaging  extra nursing and pumping  etc   once the milk blister burst  it ended up leading to mastitis   i was put on an antibiotic for 10 days and missed 3 days of work   at this time  despite my increased pumping and nursing  my milk supply went down   i was barely producing 2 oz from each breast at a single pumping session which led me to tap into my freezer stash   my babies drink three 5 oz bottles at day care   each  total needed  30 oz   not including what i feed them at home before and after day care    and here i was barely getting 2 oz for each baby  times three pumping sessions  total producing  12 oz if i was lucky  not including what they got from me when i nursed before and after day care    my coworker told me about the mother s milk tea   i didn t realize what i ordered was an entire case  but looking back  it was well worth it i am not a tea drinker at all  i have always wanted to acquire a taste for tea and tried a million different kinds  made a million different ways   this tea  at first  tasted horrible   everyone is different  but this is what worked for me   i figured  i don t like my coffee super hot and need to let it cool down  so tea might be the same way   i quickly found out that drinking it cold was far worse than anything i have ever tasted   because of the taste  i also drank it sparingly   based on the way i was drinking it in the beginning  or  more appropriately  not drinking it  i did not see much for results and almost gave up on nursing all together   i came back to the amazon site and read more reviews and then decided to try a different approach   here is what really worked for me   make and drink a cup of tea within the hour prior to nursing or pumping   take a cup with a lid  or make your own lid using a plate  add the tea bag  then add the water   at home  i use a cup of water heated up from the microwave for about a minute to a minute and a half  depending on how hot the water was from my faucet   at work  i use the hot water spout from our water cooler  cover and let it sit and seep for about 8   10 minutes   after the 8   10 minutes have passed  i dip the tea bag a few times  then squeeze it out before discarding  then i add in about a teaspoon of honey   be sure to use the honey from the teddy bear bottle because it is cooked honey and not honey from a neighbor s back yard     that s another story about bacteria and what is safe and not safe for babies    stir and drink   i drink it rather quickly and used to have to hold my breath when i drank it  but not so much any more  i still drink it quickly  but i don t have to hold my breath   it is much more bearable this way   the taste has actually grown on me and i look forward to drinking that warm cup of tea since i have started drinking it more consistently  five times a day  i have noticed my production has most definitely increased   i went from barely 2 oz from each breast to 5 oz and sometimes more  out of each breast   i am now producing what the babies are drinking the next day at day care   i am still hoping to be able to add back to my freezer stash  but that will come in time   i am proud to say that the babies are just over five months at the time of writing this review and are still being fed exclusively on breast milk  no formula  and two meals a day of oatmeal and or stage 1 baby food  hope this helps someone   good luck to all  definitely works ,1,0
1875,i was a little skeptical about trying this tea thinking that it probably wouldnt work but after eating some really junky food  the fiance is on prednisone and we have been eating absolute junk  amd seeing the scale soar up seven lbs fully knowing that i was really backed up and enemas not taking care of much i figured why not  i steeped for 10 minutes and was suprised that the taste wasnt too bad  well    i havr issues going in the morning and i will not poo at work so nearly 19 hrs after drinking this   i came home and sat down and in about 2 seconds something slid  now i thought it would be not much because of the duration so when i checked     holy       was what i said i had gone more than ive ever gone in my life even with the stomache flu  that being said the scale is showing im down at least 4 lbs    so this tea really worked for me holy crap,1,0

1878,apparently torani has already figured it out to achieving the full essence of cherry lime 1 3 more syrup is needed in comparison with torani peach syrup 750ml   though not as much concentrated as the peach  its high end taste still reflects throughout as being extremely flavorful while keeping up with the famous torani label    takes 3 squirts compared to  peach  2 squirts,1,0
1879,this is no ordinary trail mix i purchased a 10 oz  bag of this trail mix from my local whole foods market the product is 100  natural with no artifical perservatives or ingredients  i wish the makers would have given the source of the 12 g of added sugar the snack pack is filled with almonds  raisins  cranberries  pistachios  and very tart cherries each 10 oz bag contains 9 servings  3 tbsp   130 cal per serving  8 g fat  150 mg patassium  16 g carbs  2 g fiber  12 g sugar  and sesame and sunflower oil package choking warning for children under 4   made by back to nature foods in madison  wi  made in the usa  back to nature   nantucket blend,1,0
1880,i was kinda worried about what somebody else said about them being not rock hard  but i sorta like them dried hard   these are not rock solid  but they are not moist either   they are dried hard and really good   i can eat a lot of them  but they are dried plums prunes  and you known what happens when you eat too many prunes   so ration   i think i m going to order more   they last like forever   i just finished ones i had   from the big bunch i bought from somebody else back almost 10yrs ago  pretty good ,1,0

256,i purchased this product along with ultra fine sugar from amazon to make a cake called a rhubarb custard tea cake   it called for both this custard powder and castor sugar and i had no idea what either one of them were   i found out  ordered them  and was able to finally bake this cake   it was worth the wait   by the way  the recipe originated out of england  birds custard powder,1,0
1882,although i am coffee snob so i don t at all like canned coffee  i am always miserable when we go camping and don t have my coffee  i get headaches    so this was my idea and it does work for that  i ve tried some starbucks types and they were totally disgusting to me   this was tolerable though  i actually prefer the caffe one  i prefer sweet   but my husband preferred this one  good for camping or if you are wanting something higher quality than starbucks  did i just say that     then try these  not a fan of canned coffe  but this was good,1,0
1883,finally   an edible substitute for bean hamburgers and hotdogs   i toast them first   imo  hands down better than kinnikinnick  udis etc  that actually sell product they call hamburger hotdog buns p s  if you want a sensational dinner roll to fool your gluten loving friends  and yourself  try against the grain rolls  finally an edible hamburger bun,1,0
2056,trident splash peppermint swirl is my favorite gum of all time   everyone i ve ever introduced this gum to has absolutely loved it   it s so much better than any other trident gum and the flavor lasts and lasts   another reviewer said she was disappointed because the package didn t look like the picture here   don t know what that s about   i recently ordered it from amazon and it came just as shown   and was like all the other packages i d ever bought  why focus on the package anyway     giving a two star rating because the package didn t look like what you expected is very misleading   and unfair to the product   i think reviews exist to let people know whether you liked the product   not the packaging  best gum ever ,1,0
253,i used to have to worry about greasy  oily hair back in the day  i searched out shampoos that would dry out the scalp and leave my hair less oily  well a handful of years ago i started to go grey  and when i went grey  i skipped right over the  salt   pepper  look and jumped from a dark brown to bob barker in what seemed almost overnight now  i didn t mind losing my hair color at a young age   at least i still had a full head of hair which is more than i can say for several friends  but what i hated was that the grey hair was of such a different texture and feel from my regular hair  it was coarse  dry and wiry  suddenly shampoos like head and shoulders and pert we too harsh  and my scalp felt brittle i like the clear scalp because it actually manages to give a bit of the old feel back  without making my hair feel greasy as if i ve left conditioner in it  i ve used this for about a week now  and really like how it makes my hair look and feel  definately worth a try if your trying to avoid that brillo pad head of grey hair like me  gives back a little life to the greys,1,0
1898,don t get me wrong  when it comes to taste these are by far the best me and anyone that has tried them has had  but it was waaay to sticky  i don t know if it was from shipping or from the factory  but when we opened the package to split it into smaller bags to freeze  it came out in one solid wormy blob  then when we laid it down on the paper towels  to try and separate the blob  it stuck to it and was very had hard to get off so we could eat  em  i would be hesitant about ordering another batch if they end up being this sticky again  5 stars on taste  look  and size  2 stars for stickiness and hard to separate     sticky situation ,1,0
1897,i really like the idea of the large filter on the bottom   i hate when one of my k cups would not work correctly and leak everywhere but this design prevents that  the coffee tastes great with no bitter after taste  i will be buying this again  good cup of coffee,1,0

1895,my older cat was begining to have stomach problems   it came on suddenly and i felt that it was due to a change of ingredients put in her dry cat food   i began to look for a higher grade of food and read multi reviews on products   i felt that harmony farms had the most consistent positive reviews   also owners with cats who were having digestive issues seem to have a higher percentage of improvement when changed to harmony farms  she had dramatic improvement almost immediately   she still is having ocasional issues but she had developed severe inflammatory problems   take great caution in considering what you feed your pets   i changed my dog as well    it was a good decision and i am very pleased with harmony farms and amazons shipping it to my home  love this cat food ,1,0
1894,this tea stands out to me as a tea you ll either like or dislike  the aroma and taste is enticing  for me i first tasted the chocolate   a good tasting chocolate  next i tasted the mint   not too strong  that s good too  then  to my surprise after i drank a few more sips i tasted vanilla  vanilla  to my knowledge is not in this tea   but i do taste it  and like it   so    it must be that the blend of this tea can cause a possible interaction on ones palette that resembles a tastes of vanilla  at least in my case   i like the tea  but not love it   it s unusual and might take a glass or two  or a cup or two  of getting use to  on the other hand my son did not like it at all  so           that s why i say  you ll either like it or dislike it   only your taste buds can let you know for sure  you ll either like it or dislike it,1,0

255,miracle gro leaf shine is the best product that i have found to make your  hard surfaced  leaves sparkle  if you have extremely dusty leaves then i recommend spraying and rubbing the leaves gently with a soft cloth or soft paper towel like viva  if your plants are just dull looking then all you will have to do is spray and walk away   yep  it s that easy  the directions say to make sure plants are well watered first   not sure why but i have never needed to and my plants seem happy none the less  note  this is not for all plants    don t even think about trying it on african violets  or other soft leaf plants   they will die  die  d i e     i wouldn t try it on tropical plants either if you are especially fond of them    once in awhile some of those types of plants are unhappy with the product and die   you could test a few leaves a couple of times and see how they do  i second the reviewer that said   they don t bother allergies   i am allergic to almost everything scented and this product doesn t even make my nose tickle  the bottle does say odorless   not exactly true but the very weak smell probably is unnoticeable to most in closing  i have been using this product for over twenty years and have been extremely pleased with the results  try it you ll be happy you did  shines like no other ,1,0
1888,i bought a case on amazone cause i had found this at costco and was so impressed with the low sugar content  4 grams per serving which is 8 grams cause it is a 2 serving container  no other  aloe drink  i can find at trader joe s or other health conscious store has such a low sugar content  very great and the fact that stevia is being used is another big plus  so when i saw it on amazone i was very happy and ordered a case  when i got the case i find out it is just like the others i have seen with a whopping 14 gram per serving which makes the sugar content a whopping 28 grams per container  what happened  did i get a fluke either from amazone or from costco  or did you all change the formula  i would send it back if i could  might as well drink soda  what a shame  i am a real aloe vera enthusiast  i believe it is a very fantastic drink but at 14 grams of sugar it becomes another sugary soda like drink  i hope this was just a mistake update  i wrote company and found that the pulp free flavors are 8 grams  wish amazone had the sugar content available  no worries from now on i will order the non pulp with lower sugar content  too much sugar,1,0
1887,i bought these for a fathers day gift along with other candy from this seller  i received them on time but i was not happy with the wrapping for this particular product  the image online shows a nice box of licorice but i got the candy in a plastic bag  it specifies 2 x1 lb bags but i assumed they were inside a box like the one pictured  the licorice was very flavorful though  i also was shortened by one 1 lb bag of my total order which customer service said they are shipping but i have not received yet  plain package  good licorice,1,0
1886,first off  this is a great price for this ginormous bone  i ordered a few other items at the same time  so they all came together in a big box  when i opened the box  the plastic over the bone was torn open on one side  so all the  meat  spilled out on the other items   not a big deal  but it would have been nice if the bone was a little more padded  secluded or something   also  remember to open this bone over a bag or something because when i took the rest of the plastic off  it immediately fell apart in 3 big pieces and tons more crumbs to follow  for these reasons   it lost one star  in my heart  however  i expected my dog to tear it apart as it is and make a big mess  that was inevitable  but our dog loves it so much  he picks up all the tiny morsels himself  the fact this bone last a very long time and has brought our dog loads of happiness and less boredom makes all of us happy too  so that extra star gets to be back on  we have one happy dog ,1,0
1885,the dogs had been eating purina for a long  long time  i switched to newman s own and i noticed something only a dog owner would be conscious of   the waste  they no longer expel foul odorous waste  which purina seemed to do to them regularly  since they ve been on newman s  their waste is almost odorless and  well   it is easy to pick up  you can tell it s nutritious by what comes out  and if you have to pick up after your dog daily  like myself  you ll appreciate the cleaner output  how you can tell it is great   ,1,0

287,really easy to cook  boil water  turn off heat  add noodles  soak for seven minutes  done much easier than thick rice noodles  thick ones have to be stirred while cooking or they will stick together and not cook properly  sometimes they stick even if you stir  these thin ones do not stick cooking 3 boxes at a time seems to work ok we usually eat them with spaghetti meat sauce the boxes say   product of thailand   great  and they don t stick together,1,0

1713,in my opinion  the lamb and rice strips are more digestable for the dogs   i have two smaller dogs  both have some trouble with different foods   these lamb   rice are  processed  like a hamburger jerky that breaks into pieces easily and then  in my opinion  digest more easily for the dogs   the other products  jerky  is actual strips of duck or chicken jerky   it is very hard to tear apart and seems to have strong tendons or strips in the treats that would seem to be stringy all in all  i would rather give my dogs the treat that breaks easily for me and they seem to enjoy without getting sick and or not eating the next day   our malti poo actually has noises coming from her stomach when she eats the thicker  tougher jerky treats   the lamb   rice is my choice and  if you look close at that treats when purchasing  you ll see what this looks like compared to the tougher jerky treats  lamb   rice is more digestable,1,0

315,all earl grey tea s aren t created equal   i ve always heard this but just recently experienced it i ve recently discovered i love all sorts of flavored teas  from loose leaf to quality bagged   so  when i rec d this earl grey i was excited to try it   full flavored tea that tastes a little like some lavender tea i ve tasted recently guess i should add here that when i first brewed this tea i tasted it hot and can tell you it was just nasty to me   i brewed a little more and iced it     wonderful tasting with just a little bit of sweetener i traveled to washington  dc this past week for a short vacation and happened to pick up some bigelow earl grey for breakfast   it barely had any flavored compared to the higgins and burke brand   i m quickly learning that all tea brands are different  just like people try this brand and you won t be disappointed  earl grey   ,1,0
1716,i am diabetic with a major sweet tooth and am always looking for sugar free low carb snacks as they are the ones that don t affect my blood sugar  being sugar free isn t enough  anything with maltose will make me sick  however werther s original sugar free hard candies taste exactly like the original sugared candy  if you re looking for a little treat without worry  try them  you won t be sorry  taste just like sugared version,1,0
1717,i drink green and black tea like a fish drinks water  which tends to lead to one problem  caffeine overdose  to compensate  i add the decaffeinated varieties  that works  to a point  i need a change every so often  ergo rooibos  this tea smells like the stuff you pull out of a clogged drain at first  at least to me  and tastes like black liquorice mixed with grass clippings  here was the deal for me  i stuck with  it started to smell   okay and taste alright  about 2 boxes in it still smelled off but it was tasting quite good  i just placed my second order  i can t explain it  but  at least for me  repeated exposure to the tea actually made it transition from awful to enjoyable  so  you may have to give it some time  give it some time,1,0
1718,i buy a lot of hot sauces  and this sauce is the hottest of all that i ve tasted  it s so hot that my mouth was burning for 15 minutes after i put a couple of drops on a taco  unfortunately  it has a very strong smoky taste  and just tastes weird in general  i m sure it s because it s an extract sauce  i also have blair s after death sauce and that has a similarly unpleasant flavor  even though the original death sauce is delicious  extremely hot but tastes unpleasant,1,0
1719,this candy definitely provides a sugar fix if you have a sweet tooth  it was not as fresh as some mike   ike candy i have had  but not stale either  these are tiny boxes  great for portion control  halloween or throwing into a purse or lunch or backpack  acceptable freshness,1,0
1720,i found the chocolate peanut butter flavor much better tasting  i e   bearable  than the chocolate mint flavor  which was yucky the first time i tried it  but either they improved the flavor or i ve gotten used to it    i like to eat while i watch online lectures and artic zero takes quite a while to eat so it saves me a few hundred calories   i wish it was not so expensive  150 calories that take a long time to eat,1,0
1721,i picked a box of this up in london  as part of a harry potter candy package  and they definitely are good if you take being gross as good  the first time i tried them  i stood over a trash can so i could spit them out if i got a bad one  i mainly tried the berry blue toothpaste flavor  because the toothpaste one doesn t taste too bad  after a couple  i had lost my daring ness  and stopped i took these home  and showed them to my cousin  we had fun figuring out which were the bad ones  so that we could give them to her dad and brother   if you make a small opening in the jelly bean  you can tell which one it is by the smell its pretty obvious  unfortunately for us  her younger brother figured out they were the bad ones  so he didn t try them  and her dad got lucky  and got a good one that by mistake got into the bad pile   so overall  these are good if you want to trick someone  but aren t that good for eating   especially since only about 5 7 of the jelly beans are good  good  but only for pranks  ,1,0
1722,i really like the taste just a touch of salt but they are more chewy then i would like  the gustaf s rounds are a little better  good taste,1,0
1723,came in a small box with cans shrink wraped to a cardboard pallet  out of the six cans  four were dented   but  the contents were good   i will probably order again  four dented cans ,1,0
1724,i bought a box at costco and liked these better than any bar i ve eaten before  they are higher in fat due to the amount of nuts  but much lower in sugars than the average bar which is one reason they tasted better to me  though they are crunchy i didn t find them too hard as one reviewer found   i m almost 60 and don t have that good of teeth   now that i looked at the amazon reviews i m disappointed they re made in china so i will have to rethink whether to buy these again  tasty and not too sweet,1,0
314,the blue raspberry ones are sooooo good  too bad it had to replace lemon  why not watermellon or apple  it taste like soap  blugh  from a crazy candy connoisseur,1,0
1725,one of my friends in australia wanted to send me some vegemite  but sadly it would not make it through customs   being an american  my first instinct was to find it on the web   as i was just so curious about the salty spread   when my first bottle bought on amazon arrived on my doorstep  i was eager to dip into it as soon as possible   i grabbed my crackers and butter  and with the first bite     i thought that i would never taste again   the bottle went back into the pantry  to sit there and collect dust   vegemite was less of a delicious spread and more of a joke for my roommates beginning with   hey   come try this  as i am also a college student  i inevitably ran out of food and was forced to stare at the unassuming yellow jar in my cabinet   i figured i d try it again  and with a bit of butter on a piece of toast  and i found that i had now developed a liking towards the flavor   i then proceeded to put vegemite in  or on  everything that i possibly could   so  to everyone who is interested in trying vegemite  please understand that it is an acquired taste   especially if you re american  and have not had the opportunity to taste similar products in the past  i cried a little when i ran out ,1,0
1712,i feel i was misled about the  1 lb  shipping weight    at most this couldn t have weighed more than a few ounces  even with the shipping box   it was so lightweight  for a moment  i thought there was nothing in the box at all   the description doesn t say how much you get  so be forewarned  you will get just  10  ten tablets in the box   not affordable for most people who are seeking help with low sugar diets  but i will say the tablets definitely enhance the flavor of strawberries   i have not tried it with lemons yet as i don t have any  so i m saving the rest of the tablets for when i have some more food to try   i am looking forward to it  expensive but fun,1,0
1726,this is the healthiest processed bar you can get   no garbage fillers   just as importantly   no soy protein   men in particular shouldnt consume soy  but virtually every other bar out there has it in them  with a large   having it as a primary protein ingredient   check the labels if you don t believe me  best bar out there,1,0
1728,i had this sesame oil by accident  as it were  in that i was in an out of town store   it was one of the only ones available  so i got it   i ve been using it on my fresh salads with wine vinegar   love it  i tried using other brands after this first experience   was so disappointed  i frantically searched for kadoya   bought several bottles   love it  taste is so rich   full  in my opinion  the way sesame oil should taste  if it s good stuff  taste is what it s all about ,1,0
1729,for those who like are feeding their dogs the raw food diet  these bites may something you could use for treats there s nothing artificial in the ingredients  as listed on the box  chicken  turkey  turkey liver  turkey heart  pumpkinseeds  apples  carrots  ground chicken bone  butternut squash  ground flaxseeds  montmorillonite clay  broccoli  lettuce  spinach  dried kelp  apple cider  vinegar  parsley  honey  salmon oil  olive oil  mixed tocopherols with citric acid  rosemary  blueberries  alfalfa sprouts  persimmons  inulin  sage  and clove this treat is labeled for dogs and cats but i have large dogs  80  pound labs  and these treats were finished in less than 5 seconds  for large dogs  i think this may work out better as a training treat   they are easy to break into pieces there are 18 in a package  about the size of a silver dollar  and about 1 2 inch thick  they have the  consistency of freeze dried food and were very quickly eaten by my labs   all loved it but for the size of my dogs  it s an expensive treat  probably better for cats and small dogs,1,0
1730,these are fantastic gummy worms  they re allergen free and have 100  rda vitamin c  i only wish they weren t so expensive for how many you get in a bag  basically one bag equals one serving  maybe two if you re not very hungry  i think the worms have more flavor than the surf sweets gummy bears  2 75 ounce bags  pack of 12   but maybe that s because the worms are bigger  if you like sugar crusted gumdrops  try surf sweets organic fruity bears  2 75 ounce bags  pack of 12   they also make surf sweets organic jelly beans  2 75 ounce bags  pack of 12   taste great  allergen free  plus vitamin c ,1,0
313,these are a great alternative to banana chips  i was so disappointed that i could not find banana chips that did not have added oils and sugars  then i found freeze dried fruit and i am a huge fan  it is crunchy like banana chips but better because it does not have added junk  and buying freeze dried is good especially if you do not have a dehydrator to make them your self  so far i am a huge fan of all freeze dried fruits  very good,1,0
1732,sprinkle on potato plants where beetles are feasting and the feast is over   the beetles scatter and nolonger find the plant quite so attractive   it has also been effective against other bugs on other plants  but not useful where you intend to eat the leaves  potato beetle deterrent,1,0

312,i m pretty picky when it comes to what i feed my 4 year old shar pei  in fact  i cringe at the thought of routinely feeding my dog most of the mainstream  popular brands after  google ing some of their ingredients  selecting a treat that i m comfortable giving her can be frustrating i ordered these treats in hopes that they were acceptable and wouldn t be spit out on the kitchen floor  i must say that they far exceeded my expectations  there was actually a split second where i wanted to try one  they look like something you would serve on a plate with a glass of milk  the shape reminds me of minature muffins with the texture of a crunchy cookie  my girl not only didn t spit out the treat  she ran into the living room to eat it  savor it in privacy  her reaction was pretty funny if you are looking for a treat made in the usa  with ingredients you can pronouce  and doesn t look like it was processed at acme industries then you may want to give these a try   i also ordered a box of the ulti mutt   so glad i did   they look yummy enough for me to eat,1,0
311,i never really liked tea   not iced  not with peach  mango or honey   i didn t like chai with cream  rose hip  or green tea with organic raw sugar   but it turned out what i really didn t like was tea bags and the taste you get from them   i ve found out a little bit about tea in the last couple of years first  the tea that comes in tea bags are dregs  they are the leavings  the split ends  if you will  of dried tea leaves   it doesn t sound like it would matter much  whole  intact dried leaves versus almost powdery crumbs  but it does   the taste of tea made with a bag is wholly different  it even looks different  a little cloudy  more opaque and the taste isn t as bright and assertive  sorry  i don t mean to sound like a tea snob  i m not a food snob  i m writing this while trying to keep the crumbs of my powdered donut from landing on my keyboard  mhhmmf   the first time i drank a real tea  one made with leaves i was ill   i had a sore throat  runny nose and a slight temperature   we were moving and i had a long day of hard furniture moving labor ahead of me  somehow i always end up ill when we move so that the icky moving experience can ratchet up to truly horrific    we stopped at a coffee shop  i d packed the coffee maker the day before  my bad  but coffee didn t sound like a great idea when i was so congested  so i bought a jasmine green tea  i picked it at random and was surprised when my to go cup arrived with a long  weird paper cone full of dried tea leaves   we were in a hurry  so i grabbed some sugar packets and headed out   that tea was a revelation  it smelled nice and tasted even better   it even made my sore throat less razor y i ve since bought several full leaf teas and irish breakfast  this one in particular  is my favorite  it s great with a kiss of cream and a liberal spoonful of sugar   it isn t hard to brew and is adaptable  you can make it brisk and chewy at seven minutes or light and delicate at four i used to buy this exact brand at my local natural food store  but buying it online from vitaminlife it tastes even better  perhaps it s the sealed pack and that the leaves arrive fresh and less crumbly  the tea at the store has been transferred into a clear plastic pourable jug  maybe its the sunlight  maybe it gets shaken and broken  i don t know  but this tea is like manna from heaven  it s even replaced my morning coffee sometimes  i m a coffeeholic and the only time i ve gone without for more than a couple of days was when i was pregnant   this is my favorite tea,1,0
1734,comparing this to adagio chai which is what i normally drink  this wasn t all that different taste wise   i drank it cold and hot and it had a very pleasant taste   strength and smell wise  adagio has it beat   not a bad at all   of course this isn t the best chai you can buy  but the price isn t bad at all for what you get  really not bad,1,0
1735,i make yogurt from our fresh goat milk   it requires some dry milk   our local supermarkets have all switched to instant  it does not work  it is an inferior product  made for the  instant  world   the bob s red mill is just what i had been searching for   it smells and tastes good   the 4 pack sold on amazon brings down the cost of my yogurt even thought the milk has been heated before adding the dry milk  i sometimes have had difficulty getting the small limps out maybe in cold milk this doesn t happen  but in hot  boiling  it does   other than that it makes a great product   before finding this product on amazon  i was ordering non instant dry milk from a dairy in wisconsin  from there to the pnw  the shipping was very expensive  so  way to go amazon  non instant dry milk from amazon,1,0
1737,the c e t  enzymatic oral hygiene dog chews is one of three steps that have worked well at removing tartar from my dog s teeth  i give her two a day  one in the morning  one at night  and her teeth look better and whiter than before but remember  these are not a substitute for brushing and rinsing your dog s teeth  make sure you continue to brush and or rinse your dog s mouth and teeth after giving your dog a hygiene chew other customers have complained that their dogs choke or have a difficult time swallowing the remains of the chew after it has softened  i ve experienced this a few times  but my medium sized dog seems to gain control of the chew after a few wears on it  for the most part  the medium sized chews are large enough for dogs that weigh between 11 and 25 pounds following the three steps to better hygiene  chew  rinse  brush   your dog s teeth will look cleaner  whiter and a whole lot healthier in the weeks and months that follow t b  grant7 8 12 three steps to healthier teeth,1,0

1740,i bought this for a camping trip and would definitely eat it again at home  unlike everyone else  i do not taste an aftertaste or artificial taste with these  i also used less water than called for so mine isn t mushy when i mix it up  all of the regular sugar instant oats are mushy imo  so this product is  no better or worse on that score  but zero sugar is wonderful   i hate the standard instant oats because you might as well be eating cookies for breakfast   i do wish this company would ditch the artificial sweeteners and opt for something like stevia  yes  i do like these but still prefer my home cooked steel cut oats or old fashioned oats  but in a pinch these are a ok  taste is good  zero sugar is great ,1,0
308,how can you go wrong with dark chocolate covered macadamia nuts  you can t  delicious  however  the packaging is deceptive  like potato chips and other packaged foods  the package is more than 2x bigger than it needs to be  the excess packaging seems both wasteful and deceptive in that it makes it seem like you are getting more than you actually do  pictures can be deceiving  i guess this will have to be relegated to an expensive treat for special occasions only  otherwise  binge away  great taste  disceptive packaging,1,0
1727,i bought the diet tea before and i wanted to order more of it before my subscription was due  but i didn t see it listed on my subscriptions     so i thought that i had somehow deleted it  and i thought i was correcting by adding it back to my subscription  but in error  i ordered the tea with sugar  70 calories per serving  for a tea with sugar in it is ok  and if you like your tea sweet you may well like this tea  however  they do offer a diet version and if you prefer to avoid the extra calories  the diet tea is a good tea  i think it is better  for a tea with sugar it is ok  but i prefer the diet which has no sugar or calories ,1,0
1711,after doing a bit of research i decided that i should either feed my dog this or merrick puppy food   all the other ones i saw either had ingredients that i didn t want to give him or cost considerably more   of the two  i think merrick might be a better dog food  but this one didn t have anything in it that i found objectionable and the difference in price will add up over time so i decided to go with chicken soup   my dog is still a puppy  but i accidentally ordered the adult formula instead of the puppy formula the first time i ordered it   my dog didn t seem as interested in his food after i switched him from the adult to the puppy formula   he got over that after a couple days  but i was surprised by that   i was also surprised to find a can in the middle of the package that was severely dented on the side   since it was in the middle of the case that means that it was already dented when it was packaged and not damaged during shipment   at least the seal wasn t broken  but if it had been dented any further it very well could have been   despite that i still think that this is an amazing deal for dog food of this quality  one of the best affordable wet puppy foods that i have found,1,0
316,with zero calories  zero sugar and zero carbs  this is a great drink if you are trying to watch your waist line  this squeeze flavoring is much minder than some of the other similar style drink options on the market  when using the recommended amount  you will get something more akin to fruit punch flavored water vs  actual fruit punch  i don t think this is a bad thing  as our taste buds are conditioned for overly sweet drinks the one thing i would warn against is that one of the main ingredients in this drink is sucralose  splenda   so  if you are against the myriad of artificial sweeteners on the market today  this drink is definitely not for you  squeeze me,1,0

1683,this isn t my first time trying beef jerky  i have tried it already but not a halal version which i thought would be different  i know it is usually too chewy for some but it can be okay if you just want to try something unusual and don t have a lot of time  now i don t usually enjoy spicy foods unless it is korean or chinese but this seems okay  in fact i love the peppery flavor it doesn t seem to be overdone  it s one of those things to try to say you did  i haven t tried anything halal before except for toothpaste a boyfriend got for me at a dollar store years ago  he was italian but that was nice of him to think of that for me  i would really recommend this it is very good  salty jerky   ,1,0

1684,i was excited to try this out but disappointed to see that it was about to expire less than a month of receiving it  this is not the first product i ve had problems with expiration dates through amazon  it s been anywhere from taco seasoning to dog food  i understand that this is organic  but i received this in june and it expired this month  i also understand that it is a problem with amazon  but since this is an amazon review  i m bringing it up i did try it  and i have to say after trying the food  i was super disappointed that my baby wasn t going to be able to because i thought it was pretty good myself  i was honestly surprised that it wasn t bitter or gross  i loved the packing of this product but wonder if we aren t paying more because of it  the price to me seems a bit on the high side  i will say that amazon does have the cheapest price at  23 38  if you subscribe   save  but i see other organic food for less  concerns of product expiration,1,0

1686,i love this drink   i m so very disappointed that i can no longer find it in my neighborhood supermarket as the prices i have to pay now are twice what they were   however  i must say it s worth it   i m stocking up with the fear that kraft will discontinue this flavor altogether and i ll be left without my mainstay for hydration   at this time  if it weren t for cl ruby red grapefruit  there s a good chance i wouldn t drink much at all four stars for the excellent flavor  one off for the somewhat ridiculous price       i m used to amazon having better prices  in general    i suppose when you re the only one selling a product that someone wants  you can charge whatever the market will bear    my republican principles slapping me in the face  haha  tastes like     grapefruit    ,1,0
1687,i love these amazing king leo brand peppermint sticks sold by candy crate  they melt away in your mouth  from the first stick to the last  i ve been ordering these from candy crate for years   first on their web site and now from amazon  if you like peppermint  you should try these king leo brand peppermint sticks  i don t know how they make these peppermint sticks so soft  but make them they do   and they are mouth watering  when i first ordered these peppermint sticks  i thought they would be hard like all the rest   boy was i surprised   i put that first stick in my mouth and in just a few minutes  it was gone   of course i generally break them in half before putting them in my mouth   that way i can savor them longer   the last order i placed in june 2012 was for 6 tins because i had run out of tins  and i hate to do that   leaving me without my favorite candy   and to top it off  these peppermint sticks are low in fat   what a bonus   do watch out for the shipping costs because they tend to add up the more tins you order as these tins are heavy   i hope you enjoy these peppermint sticks as much as i do   i am constantly eating them throughout the day   i guess that is why i go through my boxes so quickly  and they may be high in sugar content  but i haven t gained a single pound from eating these sticks  melt in your mouth peppermint sticks,1,0
1688,3 5 out of 5 stars i offered my dog equal amounts of her normal dry kibble  a popular mainstream brand  and beneful   she sniffed them both  then headed for the beneful   i tried to head her off by offering her the old food again  but she nosed that bowl away and tried to get to the beneful   she ate it quickly and with great enthusiasm   since then  she has happily eaten it even without added water or canned food  breakfast  that she usually gets i have talked to a veterinarian who said that beneful is a perfectly acceptable food for dogs   given that  i still am not impressed that the first ingredient is ground yellow corn and the second is chicken by product meal   for dog foods that don t have meat as a primary ingredient  i would rather see a higher protein vegetable source   it also has something called  animal digest    how appetizing does that sound   i do like that it contains dried peas and dried carrots but those ingredients are pretty far down on the list so  thumbs up for the apparent taste and appeal to my dog   but a thumbs down for ingredients  although the list is better than some foods    that same vet told me that feeding a dog a specific brand of the popular economy foods would be no better than feeding her the bag it came in  overall  this isn t the worst food in the world but could be better  the dog likes it but ingredients aren t the best,1,0
1689,i purchased this item expecting to be blown away  the heat is 8 10 but very managable  flavor was good  very pronounced taste of ghost pepper  i think its best used as an ingredient rather than a condiment  maybe people react differantly to hot sauces but  in no way did this cause me to feel i would pass out or anything  i experianced a nice mouth burn for about 10 15 min and a warm stomach burn for an hour after  decent heat  not what i thought,1,0
1690,so i saw this at publix  i was skeptical as i am with every product that is not fda promoted   clearly says that the claims haven t been proven  i was thirsty so might as well have it well  bad idea  i was so skeptical i drank it as if it was lemonade while on my computer for a bit    about 30m   1h later  bed was claiming me  next morning i woke up before my alarm  ready to go  which never happens  i hit the snooze button at least 3 times   i didn t have a drop of coffee that day  i usually have 3 4 cups  i didn t try it today  sleep was meh  and needed at least 2 cups of coffee  there was certainly a difference  will try it tonight as well and see if the results are consistent  interesting results,1,0
1691,my dogs only eat this brand of dogfood   one of them is 10  one is 6   jr terrier and rat terrier   normally we make the trek to vitamin cottage and hope they have it in stock the day we go   then we pay the earth for it and lug it home   it was a treat to get this big bag of dogfood via ups    free prime shipping    and about  5 cheaper than we would have paid at vc   my dogs can not eat corn  so that eliminates most of the inexpensive dogfoods   we are stuck with high quality dogfood at high quality prices   but getting it at amazon makes it much easier  delighted to find this on amazon,1,0
1692,i have 2 siberian husky puppies  now 5 months old  each weigh about 40lbs and they both have been using the c e t  enzymatic oral hygiene chews for over 3 months   i ve consulted with my vet  animal shelter  and obedience trainer who trained dogs in the military for 20 years  all agreed that this is a good and safe product but like anything else you give you puppy dog should be supervised and timed   they also all agreed that the limit on giving these chews should be between 10 20 minutes and either taken away for future use  or the remainder thrown away   if you are a smart pet owner  you will be supervising the use of this product and if after 10 minutes  the product is beginning to be swallowed  i guess it makes sense to take the product away   these work exactly for what they are intended  to reduce and remove tarter and plaque   it is not a treat or toy   as much as it can be digested  yes  some dogs will try to swallow too big a bite and begin to choke   as pet owners  again  supervision is needed   remember  i have two pups  and after 15 20 minutes  all i need to say is  drop it  and they listen and do so because i am also a responsible pet owner and have already begun training them to listen   if the chews aren t too badly mangled  i save for the next another day  otherwise  they get trashed   the only other note i will also agree on is the lack of consistency in size shape of these chews   great product otherwise  cet chews work  but lets be smart about this people   ,1,0
322,it comes out with a better bite than real al dente pasta  at least in my opinion  it tastes good  and cooks up consistently  i tried every brand i could find  and unfortunately most of them couldn t be cooked to a point where they had a bite remotely resembling cooked or overcooked  best gluten free pasta,1,0
1693,let me preface this review by saying that i love kind bars   i love their all natural ingredients  use of non gmo products  and marginal amount of sugar per bar   this  dark chocolate nuts   sea salt  flavor sounded intriguing  but i was ultimately disappointed by the subtle flavors   the dark chocolate is a very light touch and i could barely taste the sea salt   the nuts are plentiful on the other hand  but a little too hard and gummy and they usually got stuck in my teeth they did make a tasty snack with greek yogurt however  which helped to soften the nuts  i love kind bars  but this flavor only ok,1,0

1696,i am not a seller of xs energy  but i have been a consumer for about five years   i generally choose the caffeine free versions  because i am looking for the vitamin b  not the caffeine   this has been an effective product  with enough flavors that everyone should be able to find one that they like  i like it    and i don t sell the product,1,0
321,very nice colors  i see 6 colors  not 4  because you can make orange and purple  you could actually also make brown and black  unfortunately  purple was not a successful mix  unless it take a rocket scientist to pull it off  and that i am not  i couldn t get a vibrant purple color  it was more of a mute lilac  the orange mix looked great  bright colors,1,0
1709,the sodastream crystal light wild strawberry energy has to be my new favorite energy beverage  compared to canned energy drinks  it pays off to make your own with sodastream  i ve been using the sodastream red bull knockoff until i tasted this  it tastes like a slightly tangy strawberry fanta and it doesn t have the bad aftertaste that comes with most energy drinks  looking at the ingredients  the only energy ingredient i see is caffeine  which probably explains why it doesn t have the aftertaste  no taurine   sodalicious ,1,0
1708,i went to the sunflower market in dallas and got a bag of real salt from utah  it is way better in flavor than chemical salt however the dirt and sand are off putting  you see  i add salt to all my drinking water and right away noticed real salt was leaving a sand looking substance at the bottom of the bottle so i could only drink 80  of the water before re filling  real salt is the laziest company i know for not using an evaporation filtering process to remove the dirt and sand i am now the happy new owner of 4 lbs of himalayan salt and it s not only clean unlike real salt  it tastes 10 levels better too  the company also has something like 200 different salts for your salt tasting pleasure  i will be ordering much more and sending as a gift to all my friends and family  this stuff is the  real  deal unlike real lol  real salt should use as their motto  hey  just tryin  to keep it real lol    losers this salt blows away  real  salt ,1,0
1707,ii bought 2 kinds of pu erh tea to see which i liked   i like both so i m mixing them   i was afraid this would be what i call a harsh tea  it s not   i find it really enjoyable to drink  really good tea,1,0
1706,this is without a doubt the smoothest coffee i have ever tasted  i couldn t detect even one hint of bitterness  it is  however  by its nature a very light coffee  so if you are looking for a dark and bold roast for say  espresso  you should look elsewhere  for an ethiopian or something like it i ordered it from the marketplace seller aberdeen  with fulfillment by amazon  it arrived freshly roasted and vacuum sealed  this is definitely the real deal  beware of the imitation blends  that while are fine coffees  cannot even approach this level  costing almost as much  they are quite a rip off  if it s from one of the jamaica based estates  i e  wallenford  mavis bank  etc   then it s real  wow ,1,0
317,i m pretty picky when it comes to what i feed my 4 year old shar pei  in fact  i cringe at the thought of routinely feeding my dog most of the mainstream  popular brands after  google ing some of their ingredients  selecting a treat that i m comfortable giving her can be frustrating i ordered these treats in hopes that they were acceptable and wouldn t be spit out on the kitchen floor  i must say that they far exceeded my expectations  there was actually a split second where i wanted to try one  they look like tasty human treats  the shape reminds me of minature muffins with the texture of a crunchy cookie  my girl not only didn t spit out the treat  she ran into the living room to eat it  savor it in privacy  her reaction was pretty funny if you are looking for a treat made in the usa  with ingredients you can pronouce  and doesn t look like it was processed at acme industries then you may want to give these a try   i m glad i ordered two boxes   looks like something i would want to eat,1,0
1704,picked up a single one earlier this week  and tried it out   it certainly helped  and i ll be buying more   though giant has them for  2 each where i live  so i ll not be ordering them here  but that s not the point here        it works ,1,0
1742,i tried this before having normal red tea so i waited to review  the flavor still rings in my head it is earthier than rooibos tea and less frity  the color is that of muddy water  and it has the grittiness and viscosity of it as well  well worth every penny  tasted better than loose leaf rooibos,1,0
318,i m drinking this green tea as i type up this review  i made a cup of the bigelow green tea  and this store brand tea i used to buy because it was the cheapest one on the shelf  the other brand tastes weird and bad in comparison to the bigelow tea  i guess i didn t even know what green tea was supposed to taste like before i bought this brand  the difference must be that the bigelow bags are sealed in a plastic pouch  tough as other reviewers have noted there are three to a pouch  this isn t a problem for me as i drink 2 3 cups a day anyways  i started drinking green tea simply for the health benefits despite the taste  but now i can drink it for both  compares favorably to previous brand i used to buy,1,0
320,i like to have shelf stable whole milk in the pantry for cooking  i tried drinking it but it gave me indigestion  however for cooking it s great  it s more expensive to buy from amazon but the grocery stoe closest to me doesn t stock it and i don t ahve time to visit 2 grocery stores  more expensive than grocery store but not too bad,1,0
1701,i use this product regularly  and it has worked well for my dog  who has a very sensitive digestive system but i wanted to have it shipped to my home   unfortunately  the price here is too high per can    1 75   when you add in shipping costs  it is worse   i only pay  1 59   a year ago  i was only paying  1 49   sadly  it has increased like everything else so  while i recommend the product  i can t recommend getting it from amazon  and i can t rate this vendor  expensive,1,0
1700,i was very excited when my chocolate glazed donut k cup started brewing for the first time because the first thing that hit me was an overwhelming aroma of donuts   almost over powering and definitely doesn t help that i m on a diet   however i was kind of disappointed to discover that the taste did not come anywhere close to that amazing smell i had just got a whif of   i tried equal packets and then later i even tried real sugar with no luck   then i tried stevia powder  30 grams  1 06 oz  stevia 95  steviosides bulk powder and this was the golden ticket   if you get this flavor  use stevia as your sweetener   it s literally the closest thing to actually eating a chocolate glazed donut  smells exactly like a chocolate glazed donut  tastes like one if   ,1,0
1699,i am a guy so after using it it was not much better than the other brands  i gave to female friend  she is going to use it soon as her other bottles of shampoo is used  for me  it was same  softer feel maybe  i use the salon brand like paul mitchell and buy a gallon of it and then pour into dispenser in the shower for use  this was good but i have short hair maybe that s why i don t notice the difference  for guys  the result is not significant compared to maybe a woman with long hair  does the job but not much better than other brands,1,0
1698, length   0 40 minsto compare with the quaker express flavors  these costs double  but also has  5 ounces more with  a lot of added dried fruit  i tried to demonstrate this in the video  if it s still available  clip the coupon update 09 21 12  as of 09 21 12  my local grocery store sells the real medleys for  1 79 a piece  i just tried apple walnut  apple walnut tastes like a hot apple pie from mcdonalds  peach almond tastes very delicious as well  i d still rather have them shipped to my door with free shipping  amazon prime  paying no tax and getting a free sample snack bar  please always check to see if a coupon is available  recently  there was a  4 00 clip this coupon  it s a shame you can t use the coupon multiple times for one big shipment  finally  the expiration dates from amazon are better than the grocery store  i have a month old shipment with an expiration of 01 13 from amazon  while a local grocery store has the expiration dates mostly in late 2012  lots of fruit,1,0
1697,the grape and the peach both come through ok  but there is a hint of something else that i can t quite identify   it s not unpleasant  though not quite consistent with the grape and peach flavor that is supposed to be dominant   looking at the label  it s likely the pear juice that s blended in though i won t have any problem drinking the full case that we purchased  it is probably not a flavor combination i d personally want to try again   i like a slightly  stronger  taste  and this is a bit subtle to me   it may well be just what someone else wants  however   i do think it deserves four stars  since it s above average  and beats some store labeled brands hands down  good  though a hint of some other     taste also,1,0
319,this came from an outside seller  thru amazon   the pop tarts were broken i like this flavor as it s not available in stores anymore   i won t purchase anymore however because of the packaging  great flavor  poor shipping,1,0
1923,i can t guarantee for everyone  but this food really works for my tough to feed seniors  as cats age their renal systems begin to gradually fail  my experience with cats in various stages of renal failure is to feed them whatever is palatable enough to keep their weight up  not give weird diets that restrict protein  the  renal  diets that many large companies have been trying to push totally ignore the fact that a cat in any stage of renal failure will fail faster if losing weight due to unpalatable  renal  or low protein foods  our renal tests here confirm that they are very early stage after 3 years of solely worrying about weight loss  my 3 cats are all 18 and one of the three had improved numbers for her last bun last month and the other 2 low 40s with no crystals  we still experience chronic utis with one  but that s always been an issue for her  her weight is incredible and she bounces back immediately from them as for the smell of poo that some people complain about in these high quality foods  really  if you don t like smelly poo  do not have cats  excellent for my senior cats ,1,0
1743,good product but pack of 18 is  9 99 at costco   this is not a good deal at all and if you have a costco nearby go there for    50 per bottle   even giants sell for  1 bottle good product but pack of 18 is  9 99 at costco,1,0
1745,i ve not tried whey before and bought this product to reconstitute for ingredients in bread it definitely made a difference adding it to bread  reconstituted    did not try as supplement  so not sure of taste   4 bags  if reconstituting  is way too much  as 1 3 cup whey makes one quart reconstituted   you may want to try to find one bag if trying for the first time  the 4 bags fit in a 4 quart storage jar   recipe for reconstitution is on bob s red mill website i only gave it 4 stars because i did not taste the product  so  i am not sure what it would taste like if buying for supplement  sweet dairy whey,1,0
1774,i love this tea  especially it brew very strong flavorful tea with strong honey taste  but the name might be misleading  maybe arabian mint is not the regular mint that we all know of  those who think this tea taste like regular mint tea  then this is not your tea  if you like strong tea and love honey taste  then this is for you  to be honest  i don t taste any mint  again  regular pepperminty flavor  at all  otherwise  it really is an exceptional tea  love this tea  but mint is just a hint,1,0
294,purchased to use in a salt mill i purchased at the same time  this was one of those purchase this purchase that kind of thing amazon has  this salt taste quite good  however  it is moist and does not work in the mill  if your looking for salt to use in your mill  take a pass on this  if your looking for exceptionally good tasting salt  this may be it  not for mills   ,1,0
1776,first  the bad like most other people leaving bad reviews  the first bottle i hooked up wasted about ten minutes of my time before i noticed that none of the bug killer was leaving the bottle as i sprayed around the yard  in fact  the on off dial came right off  spraying the junk all over the place and on me  until i was able to get it back and turned  on    but it would not spray the bug killing ingredients soooo  i hooked up another bottle to the hose and it worked fine   i found that all you need to do is keep the working sprayer  if you have one that works  hooked up to the hose and just change out the bottles  hooking a new full bottle to the sprayer part that you keep hooked to the hose is this a bit of a pain   well  not really  because you d have to unhook a used up bottle and connect a new one anyhow  should they work without having to do this   yes   so shame on the manufacturers for making a bottle sprayer that does not do what it should   guaranteed  truly pitiful now  the good i used to use this product a day before backyard parties and have never had mosquitoes at any of my parties   but a couple days ago  i decided to spray all around my house  grass  slate walkway  mulch  leaves  bushes    today i walked around the entire yard and stone patio  and to my astonishment did not see even one ant or creepy crawly of any kind   this seems totally impossible  because i live in the country  where there are at least 5 deer grazing at any one time  a dozen squirrels  moles  raccoons  turkeys  chipmunks   you name it  i got it  and my house is right next to limestone creek and covered with hundreds of trees  so it s basically bug central  but today   nothing   not a bug of any kind   on this walkaround  i would expect to see probably 200 300 ants easy   today   not one   i don t know why i didn t use bug free backyard as a general bug maintenance program before so if you get a bottle that will work properly  keep the sprayer portion and use that one for your other bottles   do that and this product is pretty much a lock to make your yard and your summers totally bug free  the good and the bad,1,0
293,it tastes like you swallowed dirt but it does work well on the kidneys  i feel like i have more energy and don t have the side kidney pains that i was experiencing  it almost reminds me of those native movies  where the healer gives you something gross to drink and then you wake up feeling new again     taste gross but works very well   ,1,0
1777,i can t have gluten or oates so this is a great snack to carry around if you re stuck on some kind of nutritional pariah boat it filling and a bit sweet  hello there  dates   but doesn t go overboard  if it went overboard you d be leaving your nutritional pariah boat  that would be be unsafe  nomnom,1,0
292,i figured nanuq would like this  but not quite to this level   he s pretty much been eating it the moment it s served  rather than waiting until he s really hungry   when my boyfriend put nanuq s regular food in the dish along with the chef michael s grilled sirloin  nanuq was eating all right    but what disappeared was the sirloin  all of his regular food was left behind  wins the blind taste test ,1,0
1779,first  yes i know this is waaaay too much to pay for any balsamic  especially for a bottle this small  i bought 2 bottles when they were on sale at woot com and even then it seemed like the price was crazy  but i went for it anyway if you can stomach the price  holy crap  this is the most amazing balsamic vinegar i ve ever tasted  it s thick  but not quite a glaze  the flavor is rich and sweet  although it has 6  minimum acidity like any other balsamic  it doesn t taste tart or acidic  i could eat it by the teaspoon  i just wish you could buy it by the gallon  incredible ,1,0
1780,i wish they made this in a non energy version   i enjoy the taste   caffeine is barely useful to me as i am extremely resistant to it   i wouldn t pay 58 dollars for a 24 pack when i can buy them from wawa for 1 99 a piece   that would be well under 50 dollars   this would make the cans around 2 42 a piece   multiply the 1 99 by 7  sales tax i pay in new jersey and i would pay 2 12 a can   this product is a still great and i think i am going to go out and grab one  i really enjoy this drink,1,0
1782,i drink coffee for the flavor   i typically drink decaf and since abandoning artificial sweeteners 7 months ago  i use real sugar  sometimes cream  since i m unused to this volume of caffeine  it was unwise for me to consume this can late in the evening  i was wide awake all night long  unable to sleep more than a few minutes here and there   it s unusual to get a product in a can that only has 4 ingredients as this illy issimo caff eacute  coffee  while it contains sugar  it was not sweet enough for me by any stretch   but i like it sweeeeet  still  it was fully satisfying  my husband is a champion drinker of coffee  if coffee drinking were an olympic sport  he would medal in it daily    so i let him sample this drink to get his feedback  he said he doesn t like cream in his coffee  i informed him that it didn t have any  but he insisted he could detect cream  i personally think he was thrown off by the temperature   he prefers piping hot  and i had just pulled this can out of the fridge  that being said  if you cannot tolerate cold coffee  you will not be in the market for this product  personally  i like it at any temperature  tastes like a good cup of coffee   albeit cold,1,0
1783,i read the previous reviews for this scalp balm  i m glad that i decided to get it anyway  there are a number of ingredients in here that would make one think that this would be heavy  but it wasn t  as someone who deals with dry scalp  i m always looking for hair scalp oils to use  sometimes  i  miss the mark and get something that weighs my hair down  and makes it overly oily  considering that this is hair  grease  this was light and fluffy  compared to the others that i ve  used  it had a pleastant smell  and didn t make my hair greasy  i put it in my hair 3 days ago  and i haven t had any itching  i will happily use tyhe rest of my sample and buy some more not heavy,1,0

1785,i will give the cookie the review and not the price  the cookie is huge  about 12 14 per box  i tried these around christmas time last year  they taste like maple creme and dense shortbread  they are not worth the listed price here unless you do not know anyone that can go to trader joe s for you  if they are in stock they cost  4 5 box  they are simply inflated because tj s doesn t ship or mail order  greedy people  awesome cookies  prices inflated ,1,0

1773,i liked the price of the product and my dog boo surley loves it  i think that the cost of the shipping and handling were way too high  quite a lot more than i paid for the product  which did not make it as good a value as i was hopping  according to the alert i recieved tellling me of the price i would diffinetly order it again if the price and shipping cost were fair  as i said earlier my dog boo really loves his chicken treats especially jerky  but he was real keen on the plato treats as well  my dog boo loves this treat,1,0
1788,i made 3 of these kits in the past and they came out very good for the price   the last batch i made i did in a 5 gallon quanity in hopes there would be a little more body to it as some reviews said   i found no change in the body from 6 to 5 gallons and ended up with 24 bottles instead of the 29 or 30 bottles i usually get from the 6 gallon instructions   i opened a bottle i made from a 6 gallon batch that was bottled in december  2011 and it was very good   i will not make another kit in a 5 gallon batch  nice kit ,1,0

1791,i received the raisin flavored from influenster complimentary for tasting   it was very good to me  not too sweet and not oily tasting like some package cookies  the fact that it is made with whole grain oats made it even better   i am going to buy the cranberry   yogurt next  didn t save any for the kids ,1,0
1793,i have always loved the taste of these spread but i am a bit disappointed in the seals being broken along the lid on 4 out of 5 jars  as if the jar s plastic lid is too sharp and cuts into the foil seal  anyway  i hope it s safe for me to eat it still  love the taste but the seals were broken on almost all of them not sure why ,1,0
1794,i have a love for japanese sweets  particularly those made with red bean paste  but i haven t tried yokan until i bought this little pack  that being said  i suppose i don t know what yokan  should  taste like but i must say  these taste wonderful to me  they are quite sweet actually  and i can t eat more than half a bar at a time  a few reviews note a grainy texture or whole beans  but i ve found quite the opposite to be true  all of them in my batch are very smooth textured  and i ve only found a single whole bean so far  my personal favorite is probably the matcha or the plain red bean  i could do without the salty flavor  but by no means is it awful or inedible obviously these are very overpriced  i don t have an asian grocery anywhere near me  so i paid the insanely high price here anyway  i ve found the same brand of yokan elsewhere online for much cheaper now  but this was the cheapest way i could try small amounts of many flavors i do want to add that i don t appear to have received the persimmon flavor  from what i can figure  the flavors i have are  red bean  cream  salty  matcha and chestnut  i m going off of minor knowledge of kanji  so i could be wrong  just thought it was worth noting  yummy ,1,0
1795,these bags are exactly what i wanted for cat litter  they are a little small but manageable  however  i purchased them because they have a minimal effect on the environment  but they came in a huge box filled with plastic inflatable filling  the box could have fit 40x the product  do you really need to protect a cardboard box with trash bags in it to that extent  i would have been really happy with an envelope to hold them  amazon needs to take note  if someone buys an environmentally friendly product  they will look at the entire experience  shame on amason  good bags  shame on amazon for packaging ,1,0

304,one thing i ve learned about critters  not much is going to stop them if there is promise of a big reward  especially in the way of food   i doubt this product would work to keep squirrels away from a bird feeder  for example  and if a yard is overrun with raccoons  it might not make much of a difference unless you eliminate the attractant our main issue is the racoons going for our garbage can  we already use a bungee cord  so they can t get into the can  but they can still create a racket  i ve sprinkled this product around the area and so far  so good i took off one star because i remain uncertain as to the safety of this product  there are too many warnings about how not to use it  e g  in vegetable beds   i don t know if that s due to the pepper  etc   potentially damaging delicate roots or something more toxic  the active ingredients comprise less than 1  of ingredients  i would like to have known about the 99 3   why not say what it is the product container does sport a  seal of approval  from the omri  organic materials review institute   which could be legitimate or could be a pesticides industry mouthpiece  i don t know which one here s what it says about omri at sourcewatch the organic materials review institute  omri  describes itself as  a national nonprofit organization that determines which input products are allowed for use in organic production and processing  omri listed    or approved    products may be used on operations that are certified organic under the usda national organic program      mainly  however  the organization generates income through fees collected for the review of products intended for use in organic production or processing  at any rate  i m unlikely to use this near any soil where food crops might be grown  not sure about ingredient safety,1,0
1749,i had not heard of this brand before  and happened upon it in my local grocery store   the lower price for a box of 12 cups made me take notice  so i thought i d try it   instant coffee gratification      this is a strong cup of coffee  but it s not overwhelming   at least to my taste   i prefer some kick and this has got it   i love the environmentally friendly pod as well   definitely will be subscribing and saving  my new favorite ,1,0
303,i am a little bit dissapointed with the product because some of it s features are not user friendly like the knob for blending grinding  you have to hold knob while grinding the food  i find it noisy too   what i like is the steaming features  good ,1,0
1751,i ve only taken this product once as i recieved it two days ago  i must say that while i wasn t able to achieve lucidity just yet  i ve only achieved this once and it was without the extract  several months ago  one of the reasons i was looking into this herb  my dream recall was much better  the dream was certainly more vivid  and i can see that with more practice this  although admittedly vile tasting and smelling  herb extract will be a valuable tool for me  thanks first night  easier to remember,1,0
1752,these seeds have a nice  high sprout rate  my cats didn t take to it  but they re finicky  i m not sure if i agree with the value of this product based on the price  but the seeds were of high quality  seeds grow well,1,0
1753,the expensive silver needles white tea comes from the fujian region of china and has a very light and kind of grassy flavor   if that s what you re looking for  this tao of tea product is not that   according to the label it comes from the hunan region of china and has a  roasted chestnut and wild honey aroma    it costs less but the taste is definitely different   if you ve acquired a taste for the light grassy flavor of fujian white tea  have a look at several other vendors that do carry that if your drinking white tea mainly for health reasons  i don t know if one is any better than the other   the flavor of this tea is nice and its organic so i ll continue to buy it  not as a replacement but as a supplement to the fujian variety  nice price but not quite the same thing,1,0
302,i purchased this item for my husband who loves jagermeister and redbull  i figured why not try it out and see what happens since it is about  15 cheaper than going the the store to buy them  it worked out perfectly  i got them two days after ordering with amazon prime and they were well packaged and none of them had busted open  we are about halfway thru the box and not a flat funny tasting one yet  i plan to buy this product again in the near future  save money and buy it ,1,0
1755,i was alarmed to hear about the recall after i had ordered this product on july 11  2012  i immediately checked the diamond recall website and checked the codes against the recall list  i was happy to find that not only were the codes not on the list but more significantly  the best before date was 04 jun 2013 which is almost 2 months after the date of 7 april  2013 which is the end of the date range in the recall i figured that the time range was the most significant factor because the factory would be in operation daily and the fiasco with the salmonella would have been cleared up during that time the most significant test was of course the fact that our dog did not get ill i should mention that this was shipped directly from amazon and sold by amazon  i cannot comment about the newness of products sold by other vendors it is tough to find high quality  high meat content dog food which is affordable  while it is easy to condemn diamond  i think this is one of the more affordable high meat content foods out there  invariably  a poor quality dogfood like beneful which despite its fancy packaging is basically corn with a tiny flavoring of meat  is going to have less problems with bacteria because it has so little meat hopefully  this incident which no doubt cost diamond millions  will get them to be much more careful in the future  product i received was not on recall list   2 months newer,1,0
1756,found this at cost plus world market like other review bought it out of curiosity hoping to make a tres leeches cake u can buy at world market,1,0
301,this is a really cool product  for the first part you arn t paying a arm and a leg at the museums  it tastes pretty good  it is a wierd texture to explain  it is a chalky texture  but when it hits your mouth it gets creamy  try to think its not cold frozen ice cream  its going to be like room temp  the only down side i see is the secondary wrapper inside  its almost always broken or wripped  but  its nothing to ruin the product  its sealed with the outside packaging  so i dont see why the other package is there  unless its to help control the moisture  fun and cool snack,1,0
300,i have to eat gluten free  so this was something i was looking forward to   it was good  but not great  in my opinion   somehow  the little crunchy balls did not go well with the flakes   it was like i d mixed two different cereals   some people may not mind that at all  i just happen to prefer the same texture in a breakfast cereal i liked that the ingredients were  typical of nature s path  a cut above most anything found on regular grocery store shelves   and the fact that it s organic is a huge plus the subtle vanilla flavor was not overpowering  and the cereal did not require anything else on it  extra sugar  maple syrup  etc     i happen to use vanilla flavored almond milk  and the extra vanilla flavor was not too much   regardless of what it s in  milk  nut milk  soy milk  etc    it is great all by itself would i buy it again   yes  for variety   but i purchase several nature s path products in the large eco packs to save time and packaging  and even if these become offered in the large eco pack bags  i don t expect to be buying that much at a time   again   nothing at all wrong with them   actually quite good   it s just not going to be my favorite breakfast cereal  good  not great   would probably buy again    ,1,0
1757,okay  these were very moist and they did have good flavor   the reservations came from the pacakaging  really weird  the figs were cut open and packed open face to open face so when you pull one out it  you end up tearing the one it has mushed to  consistancy of prunes   i have never purchased figs packed this way   i have found dried figs packaged whole which i can tell you i prefer having used 3 of these boxes for a recipe i made last night   i don t think i would purchase them again   but won t go so far as to say never  4 with reservations    ,1,0
1758,i have been using the clear men scalp therapy anti dandruff shampoo for about a week  it comes in a 12 9 ounce bottle with convenient flat ends on both top and bottom  which means that when the bottle starts to empty  it can be stored on its top in order to get the remaining contents out easily  the ingredients include  ginseng  mint  and tea tree the shampoo itself is a milky cream which emerges readily from the container  the shampoo is not oily or greasy and appears not to leave residues  any odor is not apparent to me   after one week of use  my scalp feels clean  my hair tends to curl  especially in the rain forest environment where i live   however  this shampoo seems to flatten my curls   you may or may not like that effect   on the negative side  the shampoo is irritating if you get it in your eyes   maybe this is caused by the mint   altogether  i like this shampoo and plan to continue to use it  clean and refreshing,1,0
1769,with this product there are no surprises   these are the exact  sparkles   they look almost like tiny  tiny squares of pink plastic that you might wrap an easter basket in  only about 1 4 of the thickness  you see in michael s or other craft stores   they re cute  eatable and i think worth the price  exactly what you expect,1,0
1768,if you prefer half caf coffee try this one it is as good as any of the more expensive brands eight o clock half caf,1,0
1767,i have been using this product for may years  i like this particular version since it comes with 6 individual bags  i tossed them all in 40 quarts of water   no mess  but plenty of flavor  simply nothing better     this makes the boil,1,0
295,i ve only tried strawberry but i truly like it  after reading the reviews i didn t expect it to taste like icecream  so i wasn t disappointed  i would buy this product again   just wish it wasn t so expensive  good,1,0
1765,all in all  good price for soy nuts  the only issue i had was the use of vegetable oil to roast the nuts  it gave them an oily taste that was far too strong  decent product,1,0
296,good stuff  but i wish jelly belly put more efforts into putting each flavor in the box  i bought 3 boxes and still didn t get to taste them all  jelly beans,1,0
1744,i just want to elev a review not all of this i got it it is what i wanted thank you a        ,1,0
1764,this was a pretty fast shipment witch i appreciated  i ordered this plant and eveything was just fine but i have to say it doesn t look like the picture  instead of white sand it was sort of orange and instead of a few bigger sea shells there was about 20 small ones  witch i think looks better anyways so i m not complaining  but sadly when i got my stuff i found the glass globe broken   but i told the seller and they are shipping me another free of charge or shipping it wasn t their fault looked like ups literally kicked it around in the box  overall i think this was a good purchase  it looked very nice and the plant was healthy  also it s easy to care for instructions are included  not bad,1,0
297,hard to find this in the shops  this and the mojito are very very good  not so much with the appletini  going to swap with someone for a taste of the peach bellini    this is so good  drink it all the time  love this,1,0
1761,i purchased this product at costco   i think i bought 4 bags for  30   so why so much here   any thoughts   costco no longer carries this product  so perhaps there is a shortage  delicious  but this price is too expensive,1,0
1760,very pleased will purchase again if price stays the same  cats more content than with dry food by same co  their fur is much nicer   healthier  cat canned food by friskies,1,0
298,i absolutely love these energy shots   they taste great and are reasonably priced   i ve now ordered two packages   unfortunately  the 2nd package arrived with the dried residue from a leaky bottle caked onto almost every bottle in the carton   i really do love the product  but it s gross to open each bottle and have crusty stuff crumble off of it   hopefully this was a one off situation  tasty energy drinks  quality control lacking,1,0
1759,if you are a salt lover and eat popcorn  then this is what you want to buy  this powdered salt is the perfect form to actually stay on the popcorn and not just fall to the bottom of the container as regular salt does  the only salt for popcorn ,1,0
299,the product arrived in the appropriate time  the box of sticks had been opened previously  but contents were intact and did not appear to be tampered  the seal to the package showed dirt on the sticky side  causing me to think that it had been opened  this is my only complaint  i am enjoying the product and feel that i am benefiting from it  greens plus wild berry burst sticks,1,0
1763,i am just now getting into teas  i have had herbal teas in the past and they all tasted the same  to me  like drinking grass  yuck  i recently bought this tea and can honestly say that i like it and will buy more  i personally add a little milk and some stevia sweetener   i also like the jasmine tea they make  good tea,1,0
1924,these primal spirit meatless sticks are vegetarian and delicious   they have a sweet pepperoni favor  i haven t tried the smoked favor yet    they are almost a foot long and  inch across   contrary to what some reviewers are saying  the sticks i got are moist and soft  not dry and chalky   perhaps i was just lucky   they taste and have a texture just like their meat counterparts   that proves vegetarians can eat well and show compassion to hapless animals at the same time  vegetarian and delicious,1,0
1884,our 5 year old boxer ate these with in 10 minutes  i was hoping for something that would last longer  but she did love them  not bad,1,0
1985,while attempting to avoid aspartame flavored drinks i found the lipton tea with honey in the blackberry pomegrante flavor   it tastes good  although it can be a bit too sweet   instead of adding one package to 8 ounces of water i add it to 16 which makes it better   the first ingredient is honey granules which is a combination of honey and sugar  and several ingredients later is sucralose   while i prefer to avoid artificial sweeteners all together i do not mind sucralose  generic for splenda  as much as i dislike aspartame it also has 60 mg of flavanoids per serving   all in all i would recommend this product  pretty good,1,0
1982,ok  so i bought the smartykat catnipmist because it received a couple of decent reviews and it was one tenth the cost of  from the field  catnip essential oil rejuvenator  well  you know what they say   if it s too good to be true  it is too good to be true  smartykat catnipmist just didn t work with my two cats  they sniffed it and then just walked away  they weren t remotely interested but   from the field  catnip essential oil rejuvenator really does work  my cats love it  they sniff it  they hang around it  they roll in it  they wrestle and play with each other  that s what catnip is supposed to do  the only downside  but  it wasn t worth giving the product 4 stars instead of five stars  is that from the field is costly  well  you know what they also say    you get what you pay for  my cats don t care what it costs  they re cats  i ll stick with  from the field  catnip essential oil rejuvenator  hey  they like it   they really like it ,1,0
1983,i love this crystal light iced tea peach but can no longer find it in my grocery stores  so the other day i ordered it online and maybe because they were out they sent a substitute  they sent iced teac peach mango    gad   that s not what i wanted but i will keep it because i hate the idea of returning it   so please send me the iced tea peach as shown in your picture  thanks iced tea peach,1,0
1984,the purpose of my review is simple   know that you are buying a coffee that is flavored   it s  chocolate glazed donut  flavored coffee   i bought 48 of these thinking it was  donut house  coffee   well  it is   but what i didn t realize is that donut house is apparently a brand  not a flavor   the good news is that this flavored coffee doesn t completely suck   don t get me wrong  if you like  donut house  regular coffee  you probably won t like this flavor   i don t   but it s not their fault that i buy things on amazon without reading the fine print  or in this case  reading the primary description    i will suffer through  chocolate glazed donut  for the next 3 4 weeks so that i might learn this lesson   read the description of what you are buying   who would buy chocolate glazed donut coffee  anyway       chocolate glazed donut ,1,0
209,i have nephews who were raised vegan but i wasn t  and i m not gonna lie   even after thirty years of vegetarian living i still have a hankering after a burger or a breakfast plate of sausage and eggs i ve had enough experience with this sort of craving to know that simply gritting my teeth and wishing i were a  better person  is sooner or later going to result in a disgusting visit to mcdonalds and two months of regret so instead of breaking  i bend  tofu scrambler is one of my crutches   not a truly healthy product  but so much healthier than the alternative this is not my favorite brand of scrambler  but it isn t bad if properly prepared  i strongly recommend that you mix the scrambler with your tofu at least an hour before trying to cook it  the results are much better  i also recommend the firmest tofu you can lay your hands on   manipulating tofu in a frying pan will likely result in nothing but an indistinguishable paste otherwise  also  don t fiddle with it too much  lay the stuff down in generous skillet of hot oil  let it cook for a few minutes more than you think it should  carefully flip it once  overcook it again  and plate it  don t mess with it too much or it will fall apart  not too bad  but not the best ,1,0
207,i have loved ginger since my father introduced me to it over fifty years ago   i have tried many brands  and was delighted to find this ginger on amazon   i ordered it several times and was highly satisfied with it  finding it had excellent texture  many gingers sold in the us are hard lumps  but this has the proper ginger texture   bite  good sharp ginger flavor without an excessive bite   and sugaring however  the last order i received was a disappointment  i have waited through about a dozen bags before posting this somewhat negative review  hoping the first few were just an anomaly  but sadly no   the issue is that  while in all previous orders the ginger consisted almost entirely of bite sized chunks  this recent order is an almost equal mixture of those chunks and small to tiny sized pieces which  because they are sugared over their entire surface areas  give almost entirely a sugar taste with little ginger bite   the bite sized chunks are still as good as before  but the other half of the bag is a great disappointment and not at all what i have been used to from this company i don t know whether the company is having trouble getting enough quality ginger to fill their orders and is filling their bags out with scraps which i would have expected to be used for ground ginger  in ginger beverages  or otherwise than as crystallized bites  whether they have decided to fill their bags with these bits to keep their costs down  whether my order was simply filled from the bottom of the batch and the problem wasn t caught in time  or whether there is some other reason  but whether intentional or inadvertent  this is not the product i used to get and is not the quality product i think customers have a right to receive when this order is exhausted i will probably try the product again  hoping that it has returned to its prior quality  but if not  sadly i will have to resume my search for a quality ginger to enjoy  previous delight  recent disappointment,1,0
1988,i ve had better  but not many away from visiting the farms on the kona coast  great flavor  aroma  full body and without the acidic bite that some konas can have  another reviewer wishes they hadn t tried it and i am kinda with you  i am ordering my second 5lb set  i will be looking for this place when we visit hawaii again next year i am perplexed by some of the comments from lack of flavor to burnt to oily to dry to no aroma  i am a rookie coffee snob and i just have a hard time screwing up the brew of this stuff and my only 2 methods are auto drip and a press  i should get the next order before i am out of my last bag and i am going to do a consistency comparison to see if the roast or quality varies  i will be hard pressed to believe that would be the case though   age can matter and that is the only thing i can imagine that would harm this stuff i m hooked  one of the best konas,1,0
1989,the pacific gold jerky is much better in terms of taste and quality than the cheaper bulk packages available on amazon and elsewhere  the cheaper brands make heavy use of msg  preservatives  and spices  the result is like having a chewy  spicy  chemistry lab in your mouth  pacific gold tries to balance cost and quality and does a pretty good job of it  the packages i bought state that the jerky is made of beef that comes from one or more of five countries  u s   canada  australia  new zealand  and uruguay  the pacific gold label says there is no  added  msg  but it does not say there is no msg  the pacific gold flavor is credible    you can taste beef  and like it  as well as brown sugar and hickory flavoring and there is no distracting chemical taste  the only product i have found so far on amazon that is in a similar quality price bracket is golden valley s non organic line  golden valley is a little less expensive than pacific gold  especially if you subscribe  the last time i read golden valley s package it stated that the jerky was made of u s  beef raised without hormones  golden valley recently raised the price of the product i like substantially  but even after the price increase it is competive in its quality bracket  good quality  good taste  price could be better,1,0
1990,the coconut drink has no added sugar  contains a whopping 4g of fiber per serving and 1g of protein and is a favorite of mine and of my son   it is a little pricey at the local supermarket  at about  4 99 per bottle   i was delighted to find it online in packs of 6 32 ounce bottles   however  i was shocked that the unit cost online works out to be more than  7 per bottle   i m not sure why the price is so high  but you just lost a customer for this product  price,1,0

1992,international delight irish creme liquid creamer  288 count single serve packagesbe aware amazon has to find a better way to ship this product  when i opened the box i was greeted bya great liquid creamy mess  thankfully amazon had packed the little green cups inside a well sealed plastic bag  otherwise the box most likely would of been a soggy mess  this is why i gave the product a 2 star ratting  please be aware amazon would not let me publish this review the first time with a 2 star ratting amazon made me change it to a 3 star before they would publish my review   i did not even open the bag  i just put the whole thing in the garbage can  i called amazon and they gave me a full credit on this order  very nice of them  it s to bad too  as i was looking forward to getting these  i also canceled my order for the chocolate liquid creamers as they are packaged the same way  i would not recommend ordering this product  fully related to the shipping method not the product 09 08 1220 update  it looks as amazon has licked their shipping problem with this item  i took another chance and ordered this again  low an behold all 288 creamers arrived intact with out one leaking  which made me very very happy  as i really enjoy this flavor  and now i can give this product a  5 five star rating  so now i can highly recommend this product to anyone who also enjoys international delight irish creme liquid creamer  enjoy world      international delight irish creme liquid creamer,1,0
1993,my teenagers love green tea and anything with a funky flavor  so i got them the mango pineapple flavor of this lipton to go green tea mix  it s a great way to flavor plain water  which one of my boys hates to drink they both liked it quite a bit and said it tastes just like the pre made lipton green tea bottles you buy in the store  i mixed up half a packet in an 8 ounce glass of water for myself  and it took some time for it to fully dissolve  the color is a bit weird   a yellowy orange  i could taste the mango and the pineapple  but with the honey  it had a bit too much going on for me  flavor wise  didn t seem that balanced  i wouldn t make it again for myself  but i d buy it again for my boys  flavor is such a personal thing  though  and there are so many reviews on here with different opinions  so if you re an adventurous sort  try it for yourself  it didn t have a chemical taste to me  just a lot of flavors going on in reading the other reviews  i don t understand why some people are freaking out about there being splenda in it  so   many low calorie drinks are sweetened with splenda  sucralose  or nutrasweet  aspartame   and splenda is a much better alternative than nutrasweet  if you don t like artificial sweeteners  then don t get this product  and read the label first   yes  it says there s no aspartame  which may lead people to believe there are no artificial sweeteners  but a quick glance at the nutrition panel tells you it has sucralose  those of us who are hypoglycemic appreciate having products with lower sugar available to us  because we have to give up most sweets  if you prefer things with stevia  then buy unsweetened tea mixes and flavor them yourselves  toss in a little pineapple juice and honey and knock yourself out  but just because this tea has splenda doesn t make it a product worthy of scorn  to each his own  my teens loved it  i thought it a bit weird,1,0
1994,i am very disappointed in lipton for discontinuing this product  like another reviewer i agree that their new products made with honey are way to sweet and their combinations of flavors don t compare to the mandarin mango flavor  i called their customer service line to voice my opinion and my disappointment   their customer service representative was very nice and stated that she would make note of my disappointment and then offered to send me some samples and coupons for some of their new teas  which was  a very nice gesture   i did recieve the product and coupons but have not found anything that tastes as good as the mandarin mango ice tea mix   i hope that if enough of their customers let them know how disappointed we are  they ll bring the product back to the market  just the way it was with no changes    i live in ma and traveled to ct to purchase all the product one store had in stock       and now my stock is almost gone   i refuse to pay what the online retailers are charging for the product  paying the s h per box is ridiculous    o  disappointed in lipton,1,0
1995,i ve owned this product for about a year already and it is still working completely fine  although  there was a few technical issues i had to figure out myself  there s no problem with the blue icicle itself though  there would be a problem when trying to install this with windows 7  there was no problem at all using it with windows xp  it seemed like it would install a different driver instead of it being  blue icicle   instead  it would show up as  usb multi channel audio device   it just didn t sound the same when i was using it with windows xp  it sounded more louder with some feedback in the background  what i did to fix this problem was to uninstall the  usb multi channel audio device  driver from device manager  then unplug the icicle and plug it back in  when the  installing device driver software  notification pops up  click it and click  skip obtaining driver software from windows update   it will now be installed as  blue icicle  and work like how it should be  make sure you raise the levels up in sound in control panel if the mic sounds too low for you  even with the gain control volume up  it shouldn t be up that high anyways as it would have some feedback in the background  i m not sure if i m the only one with this problem  but i hope this helps whoever does when i first got the icicle  it sounded amazing and i had a lot of fun with it  i still do  too  i use this with my audio technica at2020  i use it almost everyday  whether if it s for music producing or online gaming with friends  and yes  this does work for the ps3    not sure about the xbox 360 though  i recommend this product for anyone who doesn t have a mixer for their microphone  cause mixers are kind of expensive  haha  owned this for a year  windows 7 problem ,1,0

1999,i got a good deal on this from the amazon warehouse  so i jumped on it   i m not at all disappointed   while it s not the best coffee in the world  it s what i consider to be a very good dark roast   i would compare it favorably to starbuck s dark roast  but maybe not quite as bold i m not much of a coffee snob  so i can t really give much more of an in dept review  aside from it s a good dark roast  i m a fan,1,0
2001,i ve tried pink salmon before  and this red salmon  which said it was sockeye on the can  is definitely redder and tastes better than the pink salmon  since the salmon comes as a whole piece in the can  i first cut it up into little pieces with a knife and then spread in on bread to eat  it s also about  5 a can on amazon  compared to around  7 at my local supermarket  would definitely order again edit  i received another order of this item and the cans did not have the word  sockeye  this time  i still give it 5 stars because the nutritional info is the same  and the taste and appearance seems to be the same  good canned sockeye red salmon,1,0
2002,i don t know how much of a review i can write on dog food   the dog seems to like it okay  but she doesn t seem to like it as much as her normal food   i ve read the other reviews that it has lots of fillers  but isn t that true of most dry dog foods  the dog seems to like it,1,0
2003,i m not the biggest fan of ramen  but i will eat it if i need to make something quickly and cheaply  this flavor is actually pretty good  although i wouldn t suggest eating it too often because of the amount of sodium  i usually end up being really thirsty after eating it  decent,1,0

1981,the fine grind of the salt is perfect for popcorn however  buyer beware  when this is packed it is with anything else you just bought   and bouncing around in the box tends to pop the tops off of one or more of these little canisters making everything salt covered  like my entire shipment was    not sure how to get around this  but you should be warned that this will likely happen  perfect for popcorn  but take care when ordering,1,0
2005,got some of this on sale at the local grocery store today  was impressed with the taste  the energy boost isn t much different from other products to me  however  the taste is something i d actually drink as a regular drink  impressive since many energy drinks are foul tasting   tastes great ,1,0
212,i have two cavalier spaniels who are extremely active   i only like to feed them high quality food   i usually go with blue or evo   honestly my dogs are very picky  and usually won t eat dry food by itself unless they are absolutely starving   so i usually mix in some freeze dried beef patties or a little wet food pros1  healthy   real easy  just read the ingredients when choosing pet food   you want to see  chicken  or  beef  as the first ingredients   obviously food that starts with  byproducts  or the like is garbage 2  vitaminscon1  none really   i don t think there s dry dog food out there that my dogs would actually eat by itself  healthy and the dogs love it kind of,1,0
214,i am a huge fan of hansen s sodas this one has a crisp  refreshing taste  however  i don t taste the tangerine or lime specifically  instead  it tastes like a sprite or lemon lime it tasted good  but i was disappointed i couldn t taste more tangerine  refreshing,1,0
1962,since finding out about the harmful gmo s especially in corn derived products  modified corn starch  corn syrup  etc     we made the change to nature s path organic from cheerios    couldn t be happier  cereal with no gmo s    ,1,0
1963,purchased this product because it s the original taco seasoning  mccormick did does offer a premium that reads it s main ingredient as cornmeal  one would think premium to be over the original  but it s not this seasoning does not have cornmeal in it  the seasonings don t seem to be as strong as i remember and that may be due to formulation  quality control or age there s only two seasonings i use  mccormick and lawry s  a very good seasoning for home made tacos ,1,0
227,i took off 1 star as it states unscented   it is very scented  extreme fishy smell  but the cats like fish  so it actually enhances some of the bland smelling canned foods to entice them  i squirt the recommended amount on at least 1 of their 2 meals per day  two of my cats had places on their tummies like a  hot spot  in dogs  both are healing after using this oil daily on their food  great product but definitely not unscented ,1,0
1965,had it not been so very close to its expiration date  i would have given it  5 stars  the mackerel filets were firm and very nicely seasoned  the product arrived very close to its expiration date ,1,0
226,so there was a mistake made that ended with me receiving only one pound of mini gummy bears instead of four  i requested a refund and was contacted by the company very quickly to find out the problem  i had purchased them for a party i was throwing and there was not time to for them to send more before the event  they not only refunded my money  but they also let me keep the gummy bears i had received to save me having to pay to ship them back  we were so glad they let us keep them  these gummy bears are so good   way better than the ones i ended up using for the party  i will buy from this company again  great customer service ,1,0
225,it s funny   ask a kid what flavor they want and the answer will be  red  or  blue    aside from the cinnamon  blue and red are icky   to me   i don t care much for the white or pink either  i guess my favorite would be the buttered popcorn    least fav  licorice or black cofee brown  yuck   what i have found missing that is another fav is the red wrapped green that is watermelon   i live by a  deals  store and i usually buy up the 1 00 bags of 8 ounces each of the  belly flops   these are the mistakes   the ones that didn t conform to the mold or were stuck together  it works out to about 2 00 a pound for real jelly belly s but if they don t have them a neck and neck contender is the kirkland costco 4 pounder   as a jelly belly eater since the 80 s  good old ronnie reagan  i find them to be just as good   in fact  most of them are indistinguishable from jelly belly s    considering the deal i get on the bags of  belly flops  this is still the second best deal  if you are a prime member  you pay no shipping   or tax   for that matter     even a jelly belly snob wouldn t be able to tell these apart    blind folded of course beause most jelly belly s have a stamp  lol not exactly like jelly belly s but    ,1,0
224,this is certainly not a high end dog food   read the ingredients right on the amazon site   there is mostly corn and grains in this food   my dogs however love this food and are very healthy  my dogs,1,0
223,my old dog  who can be a bit of a princess  loves this stuff   the  sirloin  bits are soft and chewy while the other bits are crunchy like traditional kibble   my dog is big  but the bits are small enough that a very small dog would enjoy it as well i usually wet my dog s kibble  she doesn t like it dry  and add a scoop or two of canned food   with this  and because she isn t one of those dogs who immediately eats as much as is put down  i can free feed her the food without it spoiling so  it s a success with her   with me  it s almost a success   i m not crazy that the food contains animal digest which  according to wikipedia  can contain all sorts of things i don t want my dog eating  including product from dead  dying  diseased  or disabled animals   or roadkill  rats  animals euthanized in  shelters    i don t know what this particular animal digest contains but that is part of the problem   i want to know exactly what is in the food i give my animals   unfortunately  it is hard to find dog food that doesn t have something nasty in it   and also unfortunately  this food isn t an exception to the rule  my dog loves this stuff,1,0
222,for someone who is sensitive to gluten and monosodium glutamate  this is a perfect snack  i have looked high and low for something to send to school for my son that he can tolerate  all the other kids are getting chips  and now he doesn t feel like he is missing out  organic popcorn,1,0
221,this oil is very light weight and moisturizing and  unlike hair grease  my hair didn t start itching uncontrollably because of the clogged pores   the only issue i have with this oil is the smell   i put it on and then fell asleep  the smell woke me up and kept me distressed   i ended up going outside to try to let my hair air out but the smell is still there if you are going to use this oil  i suggest you use it in the morning right before you go outside so your head has a chance to air out some before you go to bed what does it smell like   i don t know if it is papaya or what it is but it some type of sweet fruit   think about those fruit smelling perfumes at bath and body works  well  this hair oil smells like that   specifically  bath and body works has a perfume called sunflower    this smells like that perfume edited to add  i see the ingredient list and i think the smell is from the sunflower oil   the first ingredient in this product is mineral oil   my body normally reacts negatively to mineral oil   i will update update  smell went away after about a day  relaxer didn t burn as bad because this oil does not cause itching like other hair oils   i defintely will use it if i know i am going to be outside and can let the oil air out in my hair before going back inside  very light weight and moisturizing oil ,1,0
1968,after not chewing gum for many years i started again recently  first  i was very surprised that very few if any gum contains sugar now  they are almost all sugar free  second  i specifically looked for gum with xylitol as there are studies showing that it s good for oral hygiene  and surprisingly only a few contain it  even trident  only a few flavors contain xylitol and not all of them  i m wondering if xylitol is expensive or what anyhoo  this is one of the few i m chewing now  i choose this because it s relatively cheap  tastes good and contains xylitol  unfortunately  the package does not say how much xylitol it contains and i m starting to read on reviews that it doesn t contain enough  i bought multipacks of this and after i finish it i m going to check out other brands to see if i can find some that contain more xylitol  like the flavor   ,1,0
220,i am a frequent drinker of black tea  so i am able to compare this with the many other brands of tea i have purchased before   it s an ok cup of tea  not bad  but nothing special either   the ingredients are natural  just black tea and oil of bergamot  but it somehow lacks the flavor of a fine earl grey   though the name higgins and burke sounds english  it appears to come from distributors in canada and texas   it doesn t say on the teabag where the tea comes from and when i visited the manufacturer s website  it wasn t clear there either this does not compare with some of the better quality tea makers  such as barney and sons   but for the price  it offers a decent value  a decent cup of earl grey tea,1,0
1971,i don t eat eggs  so oatmeal is my warm comfort food of choice for breakfast   maple brown sugar is one of my  go to  flavors   it disappears from the variety pack first and it s the one i seek out at the store  along with apple    i m also big on cutting costs at the grocery store  so i avoid name brands that aren t truly worth the extra money   so  the important thing for me is how this oatmeal compares to the cheap stuff there really is no comparison   the store brands are a real disappointment   the oats don t absorb the water properly   the flavoring doesn t dissolve   the texture is like someone threw confetti in hot water that was used to boil okra   the taste is the cloying side   on the other hand  quaker absorbs the water  the flavoring dissolves  the texture is nicely bumpy and three dimensional  and the brown sugar is just enough don t go cheap on oatmeal or you ll be sorry   if you want to save a buck on your oatmeal  buy the real stuff in bulk on amazon  what you expect from a company with the last name  oats ,1,0
218,because they love these chew sticks  they leave everything else alone   as puppies when they started chewing slippers furniture etc  we substuted a chew stick until now that s all they chew   great product   great service   thanksjust called the company to verify  and much to my disappointment  these sticks are made in china   when i asked them what the difference between the 11 00 sticks and these  she laughed and said  i have no idea   you be the judge   anybody know where to buy usa sticks    help  our 5 dogs couldn t be without this product ,1,0
1973,i ordered this product by mistake and tried to cancel order to no avail   i wouldn t order it again because i don t eat that much chocolate  however  it is a wonderful product if you are a chocoholic  i still have most of the jar  and imagine i ll have it for a long time    good news is that it keeps well   chocolate lovers alert ,1,0
1974,obviously  jacobs kr ouml nung is the best coffee out there  just returned from six weeks in germany  considering the falling euro  from  1 35 down to  1 22 today  i wonder why the  subscribe   save  price for the 17 6 ounce vacuum pack of 3 was raised from december 30  2011 to july 2012 by nearly 80   from  13 12 to  23 54  dumbfounded  the best coffee out there    ,1,0
1976,so this is cinnamon raspberry tea   i think the cinnamon flavor is much stronger than the raspberry flavor  so if you like cinnamon tea you ll probably like this   i ordered it hoping the spice would be cloves or something  i m not a fan of cinnamon in tea   but that s my problem  not the tea s problem       the tea bags are not individually wrapped  so you may want to seal them in ziploc bags or something after opening the box  the spice is cinnamon,1,0
1977,i bought this as a subscription for my daughter s cats  as our own cats like this   two of the three of my daughter s ones won t touch it  very strange  they are too fussy   good food  but not elegant medleys ,1,0
217,my cats love this duck formula  it has a better solid liquid ratio than the venison and the lamb  both of those varieties can be too dry and too solidly pressed for my cats to eat comfortably  to those formulas i usually add some water and mash them up before serving  with the duck formula   the consistency agrees with them right out of the can  also  the duck formula appears to be better mixed at the factory  with other instinct grain free formulas  i find clumps of white matter   appearing like cottage cheese  however  there is no cottage cheese in them  the duck formula does not have this problem  cats love it ,1,0
1979,to be fair  this was my first attempt at home brewing   with that in mind i thought this was a well thought out kit  and the instructions were easy to follow   even though i did make a few mistakes in the process  the beer turned out better than i expected   for a starter kit  i give it high marks   there are a couple of things that  had i known  i would have accounted for and possibly had a better result 1   the hops are in pellet form  and they fall apart when they hit the wort   i strongly recommend that you use a natural cloth steeping bag to make clean up easier   if not  expect to be picking flakes of hops out of your buckets  brushes  strainers  and teeth for a couple of weeks 2   the instructions say to take the label off the can of malt extract   what they forget to mention is that the label is pasted on with an industrial strength adhesive  from end to end  top to bottom   getting the label off requires a fair amount of patience and a lot of hot water   it would be much better if the manufacturer would simply glue the label to itself so you can rip it right off without having to scald yourself on a hot can overall  the beer  while a touch stout for my taste  has been tasty   the kit was well put together  especially from a beginning brewer s perspective   i will likely purchase a red ale kit from the same maker for my next batch  good  but not quite my taste,1,0
216,wow   these little guys came in a cardboard box with no real protection     subsequently  about 50 of the suckers had popped and sprayed all over the others   i rinsed the good ones off and threw out the popped ones  but i was very close to throwing them all out  and may have if i didn t need them for my coffee tomorrow morning    great stuff  but amazon can t ship it well,1,0
215,i made a mistake on the other review  i mixed it up with a differnt brand   i received a bag of this jerky today   i have just ordered another package this is the best beef jerky that i have bought off the market  however  the hi country brand from montana is just as good  only that brand has preservatives this natural beef jerky  in my opinion  could not be made any better  this jerky has a sweet and a mild spicy flavor with the right amount of bite the beef has the right chewability   i like this jerky so much  that it is hard to explain in a written review   you have to know jerky to concept what i am saying   i would give this product and the company 10 stars if i could   that should explain it  i ordered this jerky one day and receivedit the next day   order yourself a package  then you will see what i mean                  that s what i m talkin bout,1,0
1980,in my opinion  this actually tastes better than an actual cup of starbucks coffee   a real cup of starbucks will taste burnt but via does not   also  and perhaps most important to me  i can get the temperature of the water to the exact temperature i like before mixing in the via   no need to wait for it to cool down the amazon price  60 cents packet when i bought  really makes it worth buying for the convenience alone   some people have suggested that this bargain priced via is somehow inferior to the one you buy in a starbucks  e g  expiration date is sooner  but it looks  smells  and tastes the same as the store bought   the expiration date was 10 months ahead  if that s a concern  better than an actual cup of starbucks,1,0
213,my dog is allergic to just about everything  and this is one of the only grain free food s that doesn t contain brewer s yeast  i ve noticed his poops are better on this   no more  bad days   i ordered this after that salmonella may 2012 diamond dog food recall  it was a great replacement  the dog didn t seem to notice a different food and he digested it normally  easy to digest,1,0
1961,i have been purchasing this product for many years because it does help little dog s teeth   i am familiar with it  the only thing i check on any product i receive from amazon is the expiration date   this expires 01 15   i will definitely have to order more before the expiration date  c e t  enzymatic oral hygiene chews,1,0
2006,i was thinking to myself the other day  why don t they make canned water  well  now they do   my only complaint is this is carbonated water and i would prefer just plain water in a can  but i can deal with a bit of the bubbly the cans arrived on time with no dents  my purpose for these was to keep with my other canned food in case of hurricanes or other emergencies where i may lose power and utilities to my home unfortunately these are so tasty i have been drinking them every day  ruining any plans i had for long term storage   i really like that there are no additives  no corn syrup  and no artificial sweeteners  just delicious  bubbly  water edit 10 2012   i have now ordered 4 shipments of this water  and have received only one shipment that was not damaged or leaking   the most recent shipment had 4 cans burst  soaking everything in the package  thankfully there was nothing else in the box  like food or electronics  that was damaged   the one shipment that was not damaged came in about 7 layers of bubble wrap   all the others  the leaky ones  had only a single layer of wrap  which is not even close to being adequate protection   my ups guy gets rather concerned when packages make hissing noises and leak fluid all over his truck    he was relieved when i informed him it was just water   until amazon fixes their packaging issues i will not be ordering this product again  canned water  awesome ,1,0
2008,this is good peppermint tea that i don t think you can go wrong with  that said  it s also not something to write home about   if it seems like a good deal  i would recommend purchasing it however i didn t notice much difference between this brand and other brands of peppermint tea so i wouldn t recommend you necessarily spend more on this brand  good peppermint tea,1,0
188,i couldn t believe it when i saw the poor reviews for this product   i guess it proves that old adage   one person s trash is another s treasure  i love this tea  for me  it has a deep  dark  rich chocolate taste that i just don t get from other chocolate teas   it is really smooth   and  i like the added chocolate taste that the cocoa adds to the tea i also like yogi s mayan cocoa spice for a different taste   it has a more spicy taste rather than the dark chocolate taste of this one  dark chocolate tea   i love this stuff,1,0
2036,used as a supplement to breast feeding  baby was spitting up and farting constantly with the regular enfamil  immediately after switching baby was normal again  our first baby was just fine on the regular enfamil  it doesn t dissolve well  plugs stage 1 nipples sometimes  works well,1,0
187,i was tired of buying small jars of mustard seed at the store at  4  5 dollars each  this product is maybe 1 10 the price for an equivalent amount  while i like the price  the first of 3 bags i opened didn t seem very fresh  i made a balsamic mustard with it and it was good  but not quite as good as previous batches with mccormick mustard  i ll make a decision on whether or not to purchase this product again after i open bags 2 and 3  great price  but could be fresher ,1,0
2037,my six month old pug will not eat any other dog food i ve introduced  not even a different blend of nature s recipe farmstand selects  turkey with real fruit and vegetables   i ve given her wellness  canidae  taste of the wild  the latter two she tolerated  but she absolutely refused to eat the wellness  however  she loves this particular nature s recipe formula so much so that i finally bought a huge bag of it at petco because she was going through the smaller bags rather quickly  that s when i threw in a small bag of a different above mentioned nature s recipe formula with the larger bag of her fave  she won t even touch the smaller bag   the nice thing is i can return the smaller bag at petco and get a full refund  that s petco s policy for opened bags of pet food your pets don t like   this formula that my puggy loves drastically reduces her smelly gas and that s great because for a tiny thing she can clear out an entire room  i still like to experiment with her food because i want to know that there s something else she likes should she get bored with this one  but so far this one has the winning formula  my pug puppy s favorite,1,0
2038,we received every thing we were suppose to get with our order from mr  joel our order came in a few days late  but it was not mr  joel s fault  it was an error on the postal service  mr  joel sent us a 2nd plant out of his kindness and understanding  the original plant came in and still looked alive to us  mr  joel s customer service is impeccable  we have already placed our 2nd order with him for a dorsera adelae sundew variety we would not hesitate to order from him again and we would recommend his carnivorous plant business to every one  first carnivorous plant,1,0

2039,every time i go to a thai restaurant i get a thai iced tea and swear  some day i ll make it myself   i ve read about many types you can buy to substitute but to buy  thai tea  to get the real flavor  i actually found this exact bag at a local market today called central market which is like a whole foods for about half the price but i would certainly pay this price easily because it s a pound of loose tea  loose tea is extremely light so you ll have plenty to last you a long time   costs less than buying 2 teas at a restaurant  i don t care for condensed milk so i used half and half and raw sugar   my local thai place uses half and half  it was the exact flavor of what thai iced tea should be  even as it was steeping my mouth was watering  the tea is really good quality too  definitely don t pass this one up  exactly what you re looking for ,1,0
2040,the product arrived and was as i expected   i am tempted to order other types  of cat food but some reviews say that they didn t  get what they thought they were ordering  my cats like the beef shreds also but reviews said that  what they got was a pate   i don t want to take the chance  it s nice to get the varieties in one case rather than going to a box store and having to check each can i  liked what i got  fed the cats,1,0
185,i just purchased these the begining of the month and they were great they are true to size much larger than the regular ones they were fresh and not stale i was not going to order becuse of all the bad reviews but it was to late to cancel so i recived my order anyways i am satisfied with what i recived but the shipping wasnt what it should have been it tooka a few days longer i am ordering my now and hope they are as great as the last two boxes i ordered yum,1,0

2043,just received the item  great delivery as usual by amazon  was very disappointed  though  to open the package to find that these are not keurig type pods  and that you need to purchase an additional accessory to use them in the keurig  order form for the accessory is  conveniently  included with the coffee   if you have a keuring  this is not the product for you  unless you want to buy the accessory  unless i missed it  there is no indication in the product description that this is not the now ubiquitous keurig pod  nor that you also needed the separate accessory  manufacturer should be more transparent  felt like i had been  baited and switched   will be returning  sorry i wasted my time update  now that i am initiated in to the terminology of one cup coffee  it is clear that i was the uninformed one  i did break down and purchase the accessory to brew in the keurig  the coffee was well packaged and delivered on time  and the accessory to brew in the keurig worked like a charm  the coffee didn t have the taste of fresh gound kona  but did have the light flavor of a kona style coffee  i would order it again  especially since i have the accessory now    sorry for my ignorance  not for keurig     update,1,0
2044,i had been taking nordic naturals omegas and a friend recommended flax oil instead   i have recently become a vegan  so i said ok   the recommended dosage is 6 capsules daily   i cannot imagine taking 6   i take 2 in the morning and the difference in my hair and skin is obvious   when i miss a day  i can go much longer before washing my hair   it is that big of a difference   i highly recommend this product  but depending on the oiliness of your skin you may want to scale back on the dosage  very potent,1,0
2045,first glance at the ingredients and i wasn t able to find fruit in the ingredients  at least  the fruit displayed on the front of the package   the powder itself is green  and looks more like a vegetable powder than something  tropical   it doesn t smell tropical either   however  once mixed with water   it tastes like a fruit drink  which is surprising  it s not too off putting  and is a nice change from the regular vanilla or chocolate protein powder i get in the mornings and post workout  my only real complaint is that it is a little gritty   no matter how much i shake  there s still a little bit of grit at the bottom of my blender bottle  not too bad  a little gritty,1,0

2047,let s be honest  most of us buy this for the heat itself   out of curiosity or stupidity after trying blair s ultra death  i think it was at 1 million scoville   i can tell you that this is much hotter as advertised 1 5 million is not a joke so use one drop per serving i would give it a 4 5 because of the lack of flavor and taste  there s barely anything to enjoy or to look forward to when you use this hot sauce  but that s expected  i simply use it to make things  hot   not to enhance taste or for flavor  and it never fails me being that hot  it can last you a long time  worth the  23 dollars  ever wanted to breath fire ,1,0
2048,i regularly buy these after trying them at a food and wine show in madison  wisconsin   i think teriyaki is my favorite flavor but also like zesty hickory   a bit expensive at  2 each  but better than throwing your money away on the crappy mass produced beef sticks  ie slim jim   gross   love these,1,0
2049,i ordered this by mistake   i wanted the seasoned rice vinegar not the one for sushi   it isn t too bad  rather salty but that is probably what you need for a vinegar for sushi  ordered by mistake  not bad ,1,0
2050,i picked up a pack of this at my local kroger  as the store seemed to be removing it from their shelves for one reason or another   from the pile of boxes  it looked as if it just wasn t selling all that well   since it was only slightly cheaper than the regular splenda boxes  i figured why not  let s give this a try taste wise  i like this well enough that i might get another box if there are any left when i go back for refills  i was surprised to see that others complained of a citrus taste  as i didn t really get that in my drink  however  i generally only drink splenda in my coffee or tea  so the taste might ve been overwhelmed by how strong i generally like to brew my drinks now here comes my kicker  i didn t see a huge difference when it came to antioxidant benefits  i know that many times you can t see a huge difference or there won t be a visible difference for months and months  but i just didn t see anything  when you figure how expensive the original price for this was  the original price was about  1 2 more than the regular box of splenda on the shelves of my kroger   i just can t warrant other people paying this much for something where there s not a big difference in your daily life  my only other gripe was that the packets were a little bit of a pain to open  nothing major  just that i had a harder time shaking the packets to where the product settled in one corner   you know  so it won t spill out everywhere   this wouldn t deter me from continuing to use what i bought or even lower the star rating  but it is slightly irritating the bottom line is this  if you can get these on sale for cheaper than or around the same price as your regular sweetener  go for it  there s not really any taste difference that i can discern and i like it  however  it s just not good enough to where i d say it s worth the extra dollars on the price tag  considering that the only big draw to this product would be the antioxidants  save that extra money and buy a bottle of deluxe vitamins  if you re really worried about getting in the extra nutrients in a tasty format  it d be easier  and yummier  to get some gummy vitamins or something  it s good  but   ,1,0

2051,first the 2 bad things   i ve tried the starbucks fontana and ghirardelli both and the packaging on the monin is very poor in comparison   the plastic is thinner and actually broke during shipping   it looks like the end where the lid is was hit and it pushed the lid into the bottle and cracked the top of the bottle   luckily it was a tiny crack and it barely leaked any at all   the second packaging issue is that the standard sauce pumps won t work with this package  forcing you to buy their particular pump   in this case i simply poured it into an old starbucks jug that i have a pump for  which solved both problems at once now the good thing   i ve tried the starbucks fontana and ghirardelli both and this is 10x better than either one of those   there s really not even much of a comparison  tastes great   packaging leaves something to be desired,1,0

2054,the pasta tasted great  let me just say that first  i was happily surprised and will never have the need to use full calorie noodles again   however   when i received the package one box was open and the pasta smashed in pieces   it wouldn t be that big of a deal except its lasagna    which kinda of requires a  whole  noodle not one smashed in many pieces to make useable   some boxes even though they are unopened you can tell they at broken as well just by moving the box around gently  the noodles i were able to salvage worked great but was bummed that there were so many that had to be thrown out  good product horrible packaging shipping,1,0
2035,this price is currently listed at  999 00 per dozen   surely a misprint  but just in case it s not  i m giving five stars  because something this pricy must be outrageously good  seriously though  fix the price and i ll be back  i m a sucker for a great lolly  at  83 per pop  must be incredible ,1,0

2011,so  amazon has these listed as  luehders foam   i assumed this meant a candy with a spongier foam like consistency  which could be interesting they have the consistency of giant gummy bears  basically  despite the fact that they re not  foam  in any way  they re still quite tasty  even if mostly just flavored sugar   so i ll still give them 4 stars this is a german product  but the name  erdbeeren mit fruchtst uuml ckchen  just translates as something like strawberries with fruit bits  which isn t any more accurate    l uuml hders fruit gummies  would be an accurate name  i guess  since the poorly translated english label mentions  fruit gum  i have prime  and this is an add on item  so i probably wouldn t buy them normally unless they were a couple bucks cheaper than the current  4   as that seems to defeat the point of add on items   a random german site i found has them at 1 49 euro   but if you need to get to  25 for super saver  this is a decent add on item to snack on  these are not  foam   but still tasty ,1,0
2012,my dog loves stella and chewy s raw freeze dried dog food these raw bites from instinct are pretty similar  grain free  raw  freeze dried   except the size is smaller to act as  treat sized  bites treat sized is great b c these little disks can fit into a puzzle toy  regular stella   chewy s are a bit too large for most toys  secondly  the raw bites are a touch harder  therefore less flaky and crumbly than stella   chewys  this results in less mess overall a great treat and product  just a little pricey  as with all raw  grain free freeze dried dog food   just like stella   chewys   raw freeze dried in smaller medallions  less flaky,1,0
2013,i tested this product out on two dogs and a cat  daisy  my neighbor s border collie  went  absolutely ape  for it  in the words of her owner  i saw this myself  the dog would  walk  for twenty feet if you held the treat up just out of her reach and started walking away  my girlfriend s dachshund monkey had a similar reaction  monkey would snatch up the treat and run into the next room away from everyone else  and scarf it down in the corner  the treats were a bit large for her to swallow whole  about the size of kennedy half dollars and about half an inch thick   so i started breaking them up for her so she wouldn t choke in her enthusiasm speaking of breaking them up  they become very crumbly  so make sure you either break them over the counter or be prepared to sweep the crumbs actually worked to my advantage with my girlfriend s cat cleo  she would not eat the treat by itself  even when broken up  however  when i broke it up in her food  she ate it  though she gave no indication that it was any different from her normal food the raw boost bites package get bonus points for being irresistible to canines and having healthy ingredients  since it s advertised as a cat treat as well  i can t give it five stars since cleo was apathetic toward it  but i know what i m buying the dogs from now on  dogs went wild for it  cat not so much,1,0

2025,i have been using the clear men scalp therapy anti dandruff shampoo  clean and regresh  for about a week  it comes in a 12 9 ounce bottle with convenient flat ends on both top and bottom  which means that when the bottle starts to empty  it can be stored on its top in order to get the remaining contents out easily  the ingredients include  ginseng  mint  and tea tree the shampoo itself is a milky cream which emerges readily from the container  the shampoo is not oily or greasy and appears not to leave residues  any odor is not apparent to me  after one week of use  my scalp feels clean  my hair tends to curl  especially in the rain forest environment where i live  however  this shampoo seems to flatten my curls  you may or may not like that effect  on the negative side  the shampoo is irritating if you get it in your eyes  maybe this is caused by the mint  altogether  i like this shampoo and plan to continue to use it  clean,1,0

2031,i m a big instant gravy mix user  for sausage and biscuits at breakfast   i ve used several brand names and most of them are very similar in taste and all work the same way on mixing and microwaving   tuffs gravy mix is as good as the rest of them that i ve tried   i ve ordered it twice from amazon   yesterday  july 16th  i tried to re order more of the tuffs mix  only to find that amazon has raised the price from  17 12  feb 11  2012  to  27 00 for the same 6 bag package   now i love amazon as a vendor  don t get me wrong  but there is something wrong with this price change   so i am trying another brand of mix    hope it works as well for my needs  wow     some price hike,1,0
2032,after a series of long and rather sleepless nights  i felt i needed a pick me up and picked up a bottle of berry 5 hour energy drink  i ve had the pomegranate and orange 5 hour energy drinks before  i really liked the taste of the pomegrantat 5 hour energy  but found the orange 5 hour energy drink to be disgusting though not quite as good as the pomegranate  the berry 5 hour energy drink is tasty and a huge improvement over the disastrous flavor of the orange 5 hour energy drink like the other 5 hour energy drinks  this shot began working shortly after drinking it  i felt awake and was able to perform my duties until later on in the evening when i finally settled in for a long mid summer s rest i still prefer the pomegranate  but if i find myself in need of a jolt of energy and the pomegranate flavor is out  i ll take a berry 5 hour energy drink instead  not bad  not bad at all,1,0
2033,i have not had a chance to check the bpa content of these cans  or check out the additives with health ranger mike adams  published web list  but at least my cats will eat this product  they like the texture  smell and taste better than most of the other brands i have tried  finicky as they are  i do try to vary the types  but this one seems to be lasting a little  the only other one that did was the natural value tuna with albacore or crab  also handled by amazon  my cats voted for this catfood ,1,0

191,it was weird weather for ho chi min city  but what isn t weird over here  december is the start of the dry season  but tell that to the rain that was soaking me down to the bone  i just came back from delivering    let s just call them school supplies    across the cambodian border  i needed out of the downpour and stopped at one of the dozens of two stool restaurants that lined the curb  i was gonna ditch the scooter and head over to mien tay bus station  getting outta dodge seemed like a good idea at the moment  but first  a cuppa joe  cafe filtre  sil vous plait   i said to the 9 year old kid waiting tables  i coulda said it in english  japanese  german or russian  the kid woulda caught my drift  you grow up fast and fluent on pnam ngu lao  especially when you re hustling tables at bobby flay s latest dive   the kid brought me my coffee cup with the dented tin filter on top  typical vietnamese style  but instead of the usual crusty  fly specked can of longevity condensed milk  he brought this oblong thing   with finger grips on the side    grenade in the house  i yelled and threw myself under a passing grandmother when the kid stopped laughing  he helped me up and showed me it was just a bottle of lalechera sweetened condensed milk    what are you trying to pull  kid  i asked  i m not gonna fall for another slipped mickey  not at this stage of the game  it s really good condensed milk  check this out  a new and convenient container instead of that awful tin can  much more hygenic  with an easy pour spout and ergonomic design  not to mention it s quite attractive   he said  his eyes cutting from side to side to see who might be listening  the guy at the next table looked like he was trying to be invisible   i gave the kid a little nod in that direction and he lowered his voice   the taste is excellent   he sotto voced me   sweet and rich  but with an underlying caramel savor  it really brings out the soul of the coffee   on a wet night like this  it s comforting   plus you can use it on fruit  just a small spoonful transforms fruit salad or a dish of berries into a rich  satisfying dessert  and for a special treat  spread a little on toasted raisin walnut bread or try it on warm gingerbread   with that  the kid disappeared into the crowd  i never saw him again  or maybe i did  i broke my glasses when the old lady from the grenade incident came after me with her cane anyway i tried the coffee with the lalechera   it was good  the rain let up so i got back on the cyclo and headed for the bus station  one too many good times here in hotown   time to check out  besides i was all out of the hello kitty pencils and had to pick up another dozen spongebob stencil sets at the staples in hanoi  maybe check out those new dayglo rulers i ve been hearing about too  snooze and lose  that s how it works in school supplies  one last look around for memory s sake  man  they don t call it hotown for nothing  christmas time and the place was crawling with santas  apocalypse cow,1,0

714,i love muir glen  their fire roasted crushed tomatoes even won a taste test on america s test kitchen  i will say this  however  the current product description states  carbohydrates free   a 28 ounce can has about twelve 65 gram servings at 4 grams of carbs per serving  with 1 gram of fiber for 3 net carbs if you count that way   since 65 grams of all purpose flour will have around 48 grams of carbs and 1 gram of fiber  you can consider them low carb  but they re not carb free  my favorite  but not carb free,1,0
229,purina is a trusted brand in pet food  this product sounds like it is healthy  containing  wholesome grains and real beef  accented with vitamin rich vegetables   my dog was uninterested in giving a review but she untypically put her nose in the bag and started eating  much more animated than with her usual dog food  she also took a nip at the cat  not really too menacingly  when the cat wandered over by the bag to see what was going on   the cat seems to like it too  if that is worth anything   tasty product from a trusted source,1,0

239,my puppy really loves this toy  i m surprised to see all the negative reviews i d call him a heavy chewer  but he has not ripped the bone apart  and we ve had it for a few weeks  he s little though  4 months old  5 5 lbs  so maybe that s why it s true that the bone doesn t stay frozen for very long  he likes it even after it s begun to thaw  though  he likes it when it s frozen  and he likes it when it s not frozen but cold and wet also  to the person who complained that the plastic bag broke  it s just a ziploc bag  they re not supposed to last forever  and you can easily get another one many of the reviewers on here suggested using a frozen washcloth instead  i m hesitant to do that because i don t want him to learn that it s ok to chew on towels bottom line  my puppy loves this toy  so i do too  my puppy loves this toy,1,0
1929,ok  these taste great   my wife and mother in law eat them all the time   they both were on my case to eat these for a healthy balance diet  i researched and found a lot of good things about them  i don t have a problem going to the potty but thought omega 3 was needed in my diet   one day we went to the 99 cent local store and we found this brand there  i figure can t go wrong 99 cents  omega 3 and if i don t like them my wife and her mother will definitely eat them  i purchased them took them home and ate for the first time in a plain yogurt  after about 2 to 3 days my intestine were going wild   violently moving about and cramping really bad   i did not connect the dot  duh  at that time  after 5 days it dawn on me this was the only new thing in my diet  i stopped eating them and after a few days the horrible craps went away  i was not allowed to be deterred      so i took a much smaller amount after a few days same result   at that time i was ready to call it quits  again i was coerced one more try     this time i took about half a tea spoon every other day in varied ways  it took a bit longer but my intestine protested   that was it for me  i began to buy shelled walnuts for the omega 3 and my intestines are much happier   oh  as for why not just eat fish  i used to but gout pay me a nasty visit  all other people who i know personally do not have this issue at all   so please don t be deterred by my terrible experience  i gave it 5 stars because there really is nothing wrong with the product itself   it seems to me that my body simply will not tolerate these  my advise  take it slow  specially if you have never eaten them before  ps i have eaten these in every imaginable way and dose  well my wife s imagination that is  there good but not for me ,1,0

1955,i received this product through amazon vine   the product was placed in two areas   the first was around a small garden to keep out some rabbits   small rodents   it seems to have accomplished this mission but it was put down so thickly that mere pepper would have done as well   the second use was put around a mail box   while this product isn t a mole repellant it seems to work   so  this product does work as advertised   generally  i use another product   this product is a natural repellant   has a rather nasty order so it should not be used next to a house   that is why it cost a star  seems to work o k ,1,0
238,i can understand why some people may find this off putting to their senses of smell and taste  i don t have the same concerns just want to give a suggestion to those who can t tolerate the smell taste  use it for your skin  add with a facial clay and rinse with cool cold water  you can probably also use it for your hair  if the smell is too much  add a little rose water  lavender water  iris water  if you can find iris water   violet water  etc     meyenberg evaporated goat milk,1,0
1952,the cheezy chipotle flavour is my favorite  plus  this is a very healthy snack  i highly recommend them but if you have a whole foods near you do not buy them here for this insane price  whole foods sells them for  4 99 and they are frequently on sale  today i bought a bag for  4 29  in fact  i only buy them on sale as i consider  4 99 too expensive for 2 2 ounces of dried kale  let alone the  5 99 being charged here on amazon  considering how seriously expensive whole foods stores are  and how online selling doesn t incur the same overhead expenses as retail stores do  the makers of kale krunch are truly ripping people off here for 2 2 ounces of dried kale  great product  questionable company ethics  you can buy these cheaper at whole foods  that s crazy ,1,0

237,i had a running battle for years with gophers in my front yard   this is in a suburban development in northern california   there is a canal and greenbelt right next to my neighborhood with a massive number of gophers so they sometimes migrate over to the houses  although they skipped several houses to choose mine    over the years  i ve tried  fox pee salt repellents  flooding  smoke bombs  poison  digging out their tunnels and i forget what else   nothing worked finally  i got two of these sweeney s traps and two of the victor traps   i set two of each type in various holes that i found  baited with peanut butter   i know the instructions say to dig into the main burrow and set the traps going in each direction  but i didn t see any way to do that without massive digging  previously  i d dug down nearly 4 feet without finding any main burrow    so i just dug the exit holes wide enough to fit the trap and let it spring without getting caught on the tunnel walls   some of them  i could just get it into the very end of the tunnel so the trap would be stuck vertically into the hole   others  i could dig enough out so the trap sat horizontally into the tunnel   i used cable ties to attach it to a stake or a nail which i put in firmly on the outside of the hole   i covered the hole with a clod of dirt  ball of newspaper or paper plate to keep the light out  if they see light  they will push a dirt plug in front of them  which will set off the trap without catching the gopher  results were that i caught 2 gophers within a couple days and another within a week   all of these were with the sweeney traps and none with the victor traps   i did find that they sweeney ones fit and sprung better in narrow tunnels than the victor ones  which would get caught on the tunnel walls easier   a few months later  another gopher moved in at the other end of my lawn and i put a couple sweeney traps there  don t bother with the victors anymore  and caught that one in about 3 days so i would say that the sweeney traps are the best way to deal with a gopher problem   they work better than the victor ones and trapping in general has the advantage that you know when you have caught something   with all the poison  etc  methods  you never know whether you got them until there is the indirect evidence that there aren t new dirt piles for a while  just plain works,1,0

1931,now that i have actually tried it this weekend on both a chicken   fruit tangine and delectable kufta balls in a spicy tomato sauce and a delicate a lemony chicken broth  the results were much better than i had anticipated   it is however overpriced for the amount you received   but i was a bit harsh original reveiwwhat  this seems to me like it is neither fresh ground spices nor top of anybody s shop where i would ever purchase again   i feel duped   it had neither the nuance of several spices nor the fresh grind look  the blend smelled  muddy   it reminds me of  2 mixes from one of those dollar stores   i find that picture in the tangine to be deceptive  put it in a small plastic store spice container the rest of the spices come in  people  get your own favorites and grind and mix yourself in small batches  you will have a fresher   better blend   what a  10 shame        am i missing something here      i was ,1,0
1947,i think the description for this said aprox  800 blocks  we recieved 1538 blocks  we found only a few broken ones and it was minor damage  the only  issue  i would say is that there wasn t an even   of each color size  for instance out of 1538 bocks  572 were yellow  and we would have prefered more of the larger blocks  even though then we would have gotten fewer total blocks  all in all we are very happy    very pleased,1,0
1939,i m normally rather  meh  about beef jerky and similar products  e g  slim jims and their ilk   but jack links are always good  and the sweet and hot variety  for whatever reason  is amazing   so many other varieties of beef jerky are like dry  stale wood chips that you can break your teeth on   these have an incredible texture  with many huge cuts of meat that are still tender and moist in the center   they still have the jaw workout that sort of defines beef jerky  but unlike so many other brands they re still recognizable as meat  and good meat at that   the flavor is much as advertised  which may be a bit too spicy for some  but i love it   it s heat that very slowly builds  so if you ate a couple of pieces you might not feel it  but after downing a full package you ll be reaching for a vanilla frappe   the unfortunate thing is that they re hard to find where i live  cape cod rhode island   the only place that routinely stocks is cumberland farms  and sad to say they seem to have been disappearing even from there   it will be a real shame if they re discontinued  as in a mass produced snack world full of mediocre  predictable  unsatisfying fodder  jack links sweet and hot is the sort of thing you can make a satisfying meal of  best mass marketed dried meat product on earth,1,0

1951,this taste very similar to lipton iced tea with a touch of rasberry  not enough to ruin the tea taste though  it doesn t really change the flavor any more than a twist of lemon or lime changes the flavor  10 for 4  12 quart containers is a good price  i use a 2 quart  packet of mix in a gallon of water and it still tastes good  comes out to approx  40 cents a gallon that way  good,1,0

1949,i got a free sample of this in the mail this has a delightful crunch  better than any crunch i ve experienced in a breakfast cereal however  i find it overwhelmingly sweet  i try to avoid sugar as much as possible but i feel like i m eating mouthfuls of it with this these are small squares that look like wheatchex cereal  they don t get soggy fast in milk they don t have much if any flavor except for the sweetness  i give the texture and crunch an a but the flavor an f and after you eat this there is a terrible aftertaste like you ate the cardboard box this aftertaste lingers for a while forcing me to hurry and brush the nasty taste out of my mouth  even after brushing my teeth i still have that stale taste in my mouth which reminds me of the glue they used in the packaging here are the nutrition facts nutrition factsserving size1 cup  56 0 g amount per servingcalories212  daily value total fat 4 4g4 saturated fat0 5g3 polyunsaturated fat 5 0gmonounsaturated fat 20 8gcholesterol0mg0 sodium269mg11 total carbohydrates43 9g15 dietary fiber4 0g16 sugars9 0gprotein6 2gvitamin a 11  vitamin c 11 calcium 11  iron 95 the first four ingredients are  whole grain oat flour  whole wheat flour  brown sugar  sugar   this looks like dog food kibble bits made of baked oat and wheat flour  each one bound together with a one quarter teaspoon full of sugar  combined with a chemical slurry of preservatives  you also get a heaping dose of salt in each bite with the sodium being 150 mg so when you eat this  you are literally eating baked squares of flour  sugar and salt  bound together with preservatives  and flavored with the taste of the packaging i tried eating a big bowl of oatmeal every single morning for two months  getting my cholesterol tested before i started  and after and guess what  it didn t come down at all if people are eating this junk thinking it s something good for them due to having oat flour in it they are deluding themselves  they need to try eating a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast every single morning  getting their cholesterol tested before and after  the way i did  eating oats every day only works for some people to lower cholesterol  not for everyone  and this has so much sugar and salt and wheat flour and preservatives that it negates any slight benefits of the small amount of oat flour in this or  they can keep thinking how healthy they are being by eating this  this is pure junk food  if you want to lower cholesterol with food  or at least try to see if you are one of the lucky ones it works for  eat oatmeal and skip all the sugar and salt and preservatives that are in this  it tastes a lot better too edit a teaspoon of sugar is 4 2 grams  a cup of this contains 9 grams  over 2 teaspoons of sugar in a one cup bowlfull for me  this is too much salt and sugar to start my day with this also contains dye number 5  and dye number 6  according to wikipedia  new studies now point to synthetic preservatives and artificial coloring agents as aggravating add and adhd symptoms  both in those affected by these disorders and in the general population  note the above sentence where it says not only are people with add and adhd affected by these dyes  but the general population is also  num num  how healthy is it healthier to eat this instead of oatmeal the oatmeal is better for you   quaker instant oatmeal   107 calories  1 3 g fat  151 mg saltquaker oatmeal squares  212 cal  2 4 g fat  268 8 mg salti m puzzled by the reviews that sound as if this is a health food  but i m sure thatthe food marketing scientists at quaker knew that if they put oatmeal on the box in big letters  some people would misunderstand  why eat oatmeal when you can eat  oatmeal squares   full of salty sugary goodness in every bite,1,0

1950,i ve tried every brand of white truffle oil  including the most expensive in the tiniest bottles   every one other than this fades almost instantaneously  if it had any truffle flavor to begin with  had many  duds     i went to the point of using my commercial vac packer to seal the oils in left over caviar jars to try and preserve them   this helped a bit but once opened they went to nothing very quickly tourangelle  on the other hand  i have left in the bottle and used over several months and it retains its flavor   i ve noticed no real difference in its truffle flavor compared to more expensive brands  which makes sense since they re all artificial    is it the same as  real  white truffle   no  of course not   real truffle costs hundreds of dollars per ounce so  for me this is the only truffle oil i m going to buy from now on   i suspect some negative comments are coming from people who believe the really expensive oils are real truffle  creating a placebo effect  or perhaps they re shills for other oils     they are not real truffle   tourangelle participates to some degree in the fakery just as the others do  but at least they re not putting exactly the same thing  in terms of essential ingredient  in a tiny bottle to make you think it s special and charging you ten times more for it  best one i ve used,1,0

309,i gave each of my two dogs one of these bones after i picked them up grocery shopping on monday evening  by early tuesday morning one of my dogs was already throwing up  first time on my white bedding  of course  and everything after her first bowel movement of the day was pretty much water  she had diarrhea on the carpet in multiple areas while i was at work  and then two more times during the night  she was very lethargic and unable to keep any food down at all  meanwhile  my other dog has now gotten horrible diarrhea as well  wednesday morning i made them some boiled eggs  but the one dog that was already throwing up ended up losing her breakfast a short while later  i gave her white rice with a little bit of chicken stock for dinner that night and she held that down  but sometime during the night  one of the dogs had diarrhea in the house again  today is thursday and both dogs are still loose  but  knock on wood it seems like the vomiting is under control  i called the vet and she said to split an immodium ad between the two of them and make sure they are drinking plenty of water  which they have been all through this debacle  i will keep my fingers crossed that my carpert will still be clean when i get home  i will never  ever buy another hartz product again  made both of my dogs sick  ,0,1

531,after reading the description about the healthy ingredients  i was disappointed to find that the protein items were still at the bottom of the list  while the corn may not be corn meal  as many other brands have  it is still the primary ingredient my dogs did eat it without fuss  however  i noticed them returning to their food bin  we free feed  more often during the day  it was as though the food didn t quite satisfy  it could be they are used to food that has higher levels of protein  eating more doesn t always mean liking it better  if i were to continue using this brand  i m afraid my dogs would become overweight i ve seen the cute commercials with the happy  playful dogs  i wonder if they are really eating this product  it s o k  but     ,0,1

197,i have tried a lot of different powders  and while i like that this one has fewer calories  the taste is just not that good  it s hard to describe   it actually is very hempy  if you are familiar with the taste  that s fine if you like it  but i didn t think it went well with chocolate  it s also very strong and sweet there is also very little texture added by the powder  so smoothies made with this are thinner than those made with other protein powders  taste is not good  texture is thin,0,1

5771,just to be sure these were really really clean  i washed a couple of hundred grams very carefully for about ten minutes and then let them dry  and compared them to the same seeds out of the same package without my personal treatment   they are exactly the same color and consistency  so i would judge that the frontier seeds straight out of the bag do not have any residue on the exterior of the seed   lovely  nice  sweet  nutty taste  chock full of serious nutrition  good for ya oils and such  pretty sure these are an omega source among other things    not great for drinks but with baking  i d go for it   i snacked on a few after i washed them  as well as drinking the water to be sure it was clean and flavorless  as i expected   wonderful crunchy stuff since i m a little obsessive about getting for the best and freshest quality i can get  i did buy some special somiverum seeds strictly to start my own garden   i understand they grow quickly so hopefully in another season i ll have my own seed pods and be making the best lemon poppy seed muffins in town   time will tell   yum      very clean   sweet nutty taste,0,1
233,i  like many first time moms i assume  thought i needed every cool baby specific gadget available so i was really excited to get my baby brezza and really enjoyed using it at first   making baby food with the brezza is just as simple as they say  it is nice to just turn the machine on and let it go to work   after a month of making my son s food though  it broke   mind you  i was making larger batches  so it broke on only the second day i actually used it   after the brezza broke  i learned a lot my advice it use the tools you already have in your kitchen and you ll be much happier   the ease of the baby brezza was great  but if you re making large batches of food you ll end up spending your entire day on it because you can only cook a small amount of food at a time with it   instead  set up a large stock pot with a few cups of water  boil the water and set your veggies fruits in a colander above the water  resting on the rim of the stock pot   and cover the colander   let the food steam for a few minutes until tender  then pour it into a blender or food processor   this way you can cook large amounts of food and quickly move through everything you need to steam   this solution is much cheaper and much more efficient  and surprisingly less cleanup   not worth it,0,1

5144,the last time i tried nabisco pinwheels was after my favorite store closed and i could no longer buy mallomars  a great choc marshmallow cookie   found the nabisco pinwheel enormous and fluffy but many of the shells were already broken and i thought the filling had an off flavor like powdered milk which i detest   since then i have discovered dare brand pure chocolate whippet cookies that are also sold on amazon  they are imported from canada and they are my new favorite choc marshmallow cookie with pure choc shell and a tasty marshmallow center on top of a quality base cookie or bisquit as the canadians call it  it s a premium cookie with none of the tricks used by american bakeries these days to fill the cookie with air or other cost cutting measures  it harkens back to the cookies we remembered from our childhoods in the 50 s and 60 s and the recipe hasn t changed  if you get the craving  i heartily recommend these dare choc marshmallow whippet cookies  like the original mallomars they are a tried and true classic full of the chocolate marshmallow goodness you remembered from childhood  pinwheels taste like powdered milk,0,1
5756,i am a peanut butter person   i have a serving of the natural stuff almost everyday   i saw these  read the reviews  and thought   what a great halloween treat for the neighbor s children so i don t overdose them on more candy    not so much   these are in the form of nuggets   they have a thin  salty  crispy pretzel shell that encloses a small dollop of slightly sweet peanut butter   the pretzel shell is fine   the peanut butter is quite dried out   when the nugget is chewed  the salty pretzel flavor pretty much overwhelms the peanut butter flavor   the dry peanut butter then mostly serves to make the entire experience similar to a mouth full of several unadorned saltine crackers  not great,0,1

4975,i was very excited to try these bags given the great reviews that they had  they re biodegradable  have reinforced seams  and each package has an inspection tag that comes out  making me feel like their quality should be good  but now that i ve been through more than 1 package of them  i conclude that i prefer the lansinoh bags  1  these bags are perforated on three sides at the top  initially  i thought this would be a good thing  but it takes two hands and some mental focus to get them open  this annoys me  2  once the perforated parts have been removed  they still don t open as easily  and the top part is much larger  both of these things make it more difficult to pour milk into them and increase the risk of spillage  for me   3  every brand of breast milk bag i ve had has a few that leaked during thawing  but these were the first bags i have ever used that leaked immediately    with  no freezing involved  i was pouring milk in to the bag  and the bag was pouring it out onto my desk  i think you failed  inspection  1310712 a  really wanted to like these more than the lansinoh bags,0,1

5432,my husband is a type 2 diabetic who enjoys sweet treats  so i ve tried to look for sugar free products that will agree with him and satisfy his sweet tooth  he loves chocolate brownies so after reading most of the positive reviews here  i decided to buy the six pack brownie mix and try it out my husband liked the taste though he admitted it was nowhere near as rich and flavorful as the ghirardelli brownie mixes which i use occasionally at home  taste aside  he also experienced bloating and excessive gas  initially i thought this was due to something else he ate  but when he ate another brownie  similar effects convinced us it was due to the maltitol ingredient in the mix i think this mix will be ok for those who are not averse to maltitol  but i would not advise it for those who are averse to it  i guess my search for the perfect sugar free brownie mix continues  tastes great  but husband had terrible gas,0,1
5751,i got my dog the paw flapper because he s a basset hound mix and loves to use his nose  he s also pretty smart  so keeping him occupied can be difficult  unfortunately  this is a super simple puzzle  the first time he played with it  it took him about ten minutes to find all the treats  the next time  it took five minutes  there really isn t anything that challenging about it  opening the flaps takes my dog a second  and all he has to do is keep pushing his nose into the holes to rotate the top and find all the treats  he had fun  but then it s a toy full of treats  so that s a given the puzzle does seem to be well made though  so it s not a bad product  it just isn t challenging enough  i ll be returning it and trying one of the other puzzles  paw flapper fun  but too easy,0,1

5281,after reading the other reviews on this product  i was expecting beans that were moister and more flexible than the ones that i received   but  i must say  the vanilla aroma was strong and the total quantity was high enough for me to try to make a quart of extract   these beans seemed dry and brittle and were stiff compared to the free beans that i recieved along with my order   i ll have to update my review in a couple of months once the extract sits around and becomes extract   we shall see    extract grade b vanilla beans,0,1

5547,on its face  this seems like a quasi healthy alternative for breakfast  but no  this is something i ate before adopting a healthier lifestyle   now i pay attention to labels  and i encourage you to read the nutrition label before making your purchase  if it still reads okay with you  then great as to the actual taste  these are very sweet  especially if you add less water for a thicker consistency  they do keep you full for several hours  and hold you over  convenient but way too many carbs and too much sugar,0,1
4965,i am a regular matcha drinker  and have been buying matcha from mitsuwa or sunrise mart nyc for years  but bought this republic of tea matcha at the local whole foods  the colour of the tea is nothing like in the image on the package  it is a dull green  which means more oxidation and stems   there are usually three qualities of matcha  ceremonial  universal  and culinary  i am giving this tea 1 star because it is culinary quality at best  don t waste your money if you want good matcha  is best to try the universal quality maeda en  gold package   or if you want to splurge  try the ceremonial  black package  quality  both for sale here on amazon or straight from the maeda en website  terrible quality,0,1

702,the oil itself is great  my complaint is with the actual amount that is received in the container  when you open the lid  it looks like the entire container is filled with the oil  however  once you get past about the top two inches  you realize that there is about 5 inches of empty air  so  in reality  while you are paying for a 54 oz container of oil  you are really only receiving about 1 2 that much  very misleading amount,0,1

589,when i first saw this product i thought  great  all natural coconut and shea butter  it s the latest rave and so good for you  this product also smells so deliciously wonderful  like a coconut pineapple tropical delight  i really like how it feels on my long frizzy hair and makes it so shiney and smooth  wonderful stuff   once i really looked into the ingredients  i was horrified  i ve been really looking at ingredients closely these days and did the same with this product first ingredient mineral oil  not the greatest stuff since is it a by product of distillation of gasoline and considered a carcinogenic by some people second  hydrogenated coconut oil  what does that mean  i know coconut oil in it s raw form is really good in our diets and on our skin  after some google research i found out that hydrogentated coconut oil is created by heating to 500 1000 degrees  then a catalyst is injected  the catalyst is typically nickel  platinum  or even aluminum  this stuff is bad for you  it is closer to plastic than a good for you organic compound sure  you re not putting it in your body  but there is some absorption that takes place when you squeeze it in your hands and through you scalp third ingredient  even worse  styrene butadiene copolymer  labeled as bht and most people don t notice this ingredient or even think anything of it  it s synthetic rubber used in car tires  yuck  embalming fluid  even more yuck  it has been associated to child hyper activity and cancer i just can t give this item a good review  it s not even gluten free since it has wheat germ oil  other ingredients are good  like sweet almond oil and aloe this product feels really nice in my hair and i will use in on an occassional basis  but not on a daily basis  i have found plain shea butter or coconut oil in raw form is the very best thing for my dry  frizzy hair  loved at first  but ingredients are not natural ,0,1

4925,i tried this tea on recommendation in homeland  and becaue the varieties in it are the same genetic strains as in taiwan  18 tea  which is one of the truly best in the world   i should have been more cautious about a recommendation from a tv series that also portrayed the blaser r93 tactical lrs2 as a fantastic rifle rather than just a very good one  and then demonstrated only amateur level accuracy with it   to quote buffy   my bad    this tea is excellent in the spectrum of english teas  especially those for teabag ball use   compared to the genetically related taiwan  18  it is poor   compared to sun moon lake black  it is very poor to terrible   however those teas can t be used in bags or even small strainers for brewing  and are at the far extreme height of taste and quality   this tea also is best made in bags or very close mesh strainers  not those designed for larger leaf teas   rated as 2 stars because it is acceptable if all my other teas are used up and out of stock   and to remind me how good the others taste   however  that compares it to sun moon lake black or yunnan tgfop black   compared to the standard engislh or russian tea  it is very good   if that is the standard of comparison  it would be a fairly solid 4 star rating  although more costly than some   incidentally  it does taste like an assam with african tea flavoring  not darjeeling or ceylon teas for what it is worth  i asked someone else to try this tea  who always brews loose leaf tea  usually an  english breakfast  mix of some type   the rating was significantly lower than mine     1 star compared other  tea bag  type loose leaf teas   couldn t even give it away  which surprised me   i thought it was better than that  taste and point of view,0,1

5182,item arrived after at very end of allotted shipping timeframe   product s unremarkable plastic bottles were packed in a twin pak box that required considerably larger exterior packaging for secure delivery   these 16 9 oz bottles are even smaller than expected  each of the two is about the size of a premium soft drink bottle   what was more disappointing was the lackluster taste and flavor impact of the oil itself  although smooth and light  it is nothing special   its use imparted no enhancing flavor when used to pop corn in an electric popcorn popper and certainly offered nothing special when used to toss a fresh salad with balsamic vinegar this betterbody foods organic oil may indeed have been processed in an ultra fabulous unique manner  but i discern no real taste difference from the grocery chain s 48oz bottle of crisco brand canola oil  bought on sale locally today for  2 99  with its own light taste  cholesterol free rating  and trans fat free purity   save your dollars  use more distinctive coconut oil for your corn popping  you likely will have fewer unpopped kernels than was the case with the steeply priced betterbody food s organic canola oil  and buy your cold processed canola oil in larger containers  having a more favorable price per ounce  ok  but not good value or extrodinary taste,0,1

352,this product is so delicious that i find myself having it at any time of the day that i feel like it  my only issue    and why i didn t give it 5 stars    is that i wish i could get the bigger bags instead of the 12 oz  ones update 6 14 12  this is great cereal  but the last two whole deliveries were so stale  it tasted like wet cardboard  if you can ship fresh product  i would be more than happy to get it again  last two deliveries were stale,0,1

444,i don t like coffee and this k cup is one of the reasons why  it doesn t taste anything at all like a cinnamon roll  i need a strong flavored coffee in order for me to be able to drink it   it kind of reminds me of taking medication  i only bought this coffee because i am currently on a diet and this is pretty much all i can have in the morning  maybe it is because i can t have any creamer  but just adding truvia doesn t help the taste of this coffee  with that said if you love chocolate then you will love donut house chocolate glaze donut flavored coffee  with a couple packs of truvia it taste like eating a chocolate glaze donut  and donut shop coconut mocha  omg   this taste exactly like hershey s mound candy bar   i feel guilty drinking it  lol   more like essence of cinnamon then cinnamon roll,0,1
5411,months  do they bring it in a rowing boat from korea  what gives  the product itself is heavenly  i ve had it before and that s why i am putting up with this ridiculous waiting time  do i recommend it  only if you have a stash  otherwise  go find a korean grocery store and get them to find it for you  for the price  the wait is obscene  deliver is months after you place the order,0,1
529,i wanted to like this cereal  it has fiber and whole grains and no gluten and and and  it consists of little flakes sort of like special k  little vanilla  cocoa puffs  style spheres  and rice krispies dealies  it has 7 grams of sugar per serving  which is more than the 3 grams nutritionists recommend  but far less than many other cereals  only 3 grams of dietary fiber  from gas producing inulin  not a natural foodstuff  btw  and 2 of protein are kind of measly for this kind of cereal  but the biggest drawback for me is the vanilla flavor  it tastes off  like cheap  fake vanilla  although the ingredients list says it s  natural vanilla flavor  nature s path  hmm  not exactly the road less travelled     so so   vanilla flavor tastes fake,0,1
170,i cannot get past the written description of this item  it sounds as though it were written by a 10 year old  yes  that does influence my decision to purchase  and no i will not   are the white airheads  strawberry flavored   or of a  variety of flavors   or of a  scrumptious flavor that you can t quite put a finger on   get your act together  amazon from the item page  fresh  brand new  factory sealed box of 36 packs of strawberry flavored air heads taffy candy  airheads white mystery candies air heads are a taffy that comes in a variety of flavors  airheads white mystery candies are taffy that comes in a variety of flavors  the taste is fantastic and lasts a long time not your normal taffy  air heads are traditional taffy with a kick  intensely fruity  air heads will leave your taste buds begging for more  the white mystery flavor of air heads will keep you guessing with a scrumptious flavor that you can t quite put a finger on  when your done devouring it  you probably wont know what flavor you just had but you ll definitely want some more  perfect for any occasion  these treats are staples at snack shacks  sporting events  birthday parties  and are great for halloween  poor description,0,1

5780,for quite some time  i have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food   before i started doing this  i only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches   even though i have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period  tabasco brand habanero sauce has set itself apart from the others as being a hot sauce that i do not consider to be a favorite   its flavor is novel and peculiar but not to my liking   it also has a strong heat  but that is understandable since it is a habanero sauce  but it is still too hot for my liking   i did use the entire bottle of it  though  and tried it on several food items   even though i am glad that i tried this hot sauce  it is not pleasing to me  not a preferential hot sauce,0,1
5192,i tried several of the varities to pad my orders  including the kona coast chai  lahaina spice and hawaiian breakfast lahaina spice is the best of the three  and it is between 2 and 3 stars  it is not real chai tea  but a hawaiian version of it if you need something to pad an order for free shipping  consider the lahaina spice  the other 2 varities taste like lipton black tea  tastes like lipton tea,0,1
341,i am a big fan of eating cereal any time of the day  especially for breakfast  it s fast  convenient  and a healthy start to the day  i was excited about tasting this cereal because it is gluten free and contains quinoa  which dr  oz says is a must for any diet  on first inspection  the cereal looks as if it s a combination of corn pops  rice krispies  and wheaties  it has a lot going on in one box  in terms of taste  it has a vanilla flavoring that lingers in your mouth long after you have eaten it  not very appealing  as for  the nutritional value  i was surprised at the lack thereof  comparing original special k  serving size is one cup  to the crunchy vanilla sunrise  serving size is 2 3 cup  without adding any milk  sk has 15  vitamin a of the daily recommended amount and cvs has 0   as for vitamin c  sk has 35  and cvs has 0  and sugars sk has 4g and cvs has 7g  it doesn t look like the crunchy vanilla sunrise is all that healthy  overall  if you like the taste  it s probably better than eating a sugary cereal  however  i wouldn t buy it  healthy breakfast choice ,0,1

5378,the tea tastes average and smells great    but i don t like the heavy flavor of the black tea   the black tea overwhelms the jasmine   this is a good breakfast tea alternative    will keep you awake for hours if you tend to drink your tea in the morning  not the best jasmine blend,0,1
5376,usually purchase this brand in the green package listed as kronung and that is the best coffee ever for those that like a mild european roast  this meister rostung was bitter  and strong and definately a disappointment  live and learn  seller great   product terrible,0,1
189,we purchased this food for our two year old cockapoo as she has allergies   after three weeks she became extremely sick  liver enzymes were five times normal range  had to be hospitalized with iv s and medicines   there is nothing else that we can think of that she came in contact with during that time frame that would have caused this problem   fortunately we have excellent vets who got her back to good health again   this is just a caution  so watch your dogs when switching foods and feeding this one  possible problem,0,1

497,the flavor of this tea was excellent   be sure to check the web for side effects and conditions that preclude the use of this tea   i had a bad reaction after drinking one cup and found out that not everyone should be drinking it  it took me a full day and night to recover   for some of us this tea is like taking a very strong medication  check on side effects before purchase,0,1
5374,please dont buy dog food with corn as the main ingredient   they cant digest it    and it will pass it through    spend a little more and you will be glad you did      as in less dog waste    better fur  and a happy full dog   with a little internet research a 20  bag will cost about  5 more     is it worth it to you     better choices for your loved one,0,1
5067,first of all  i can t understand why this is so expensive since it s less than  2 in the grocery store  but anyway  i bought a couple of these when they first came out and were buy one get one free  made the cinnamon ones to take to church this morning  i didn t pay attention to the nutritional listing and didn t know that they only made six muffins  who packages a muffin mix to only make 6  the container is tall so that you have room to shake  i realized after opening it  and it gives the illusion of having much more in there  so    to try and stretch it out to look like more  i made a  batch of minis for the small group that i meet with  the really bad part is that you can t scrape the batter with a spatula like you can when it s in a bowl  you can easily leave a whole mini muffin in there  i have a skinny spatula that i had just bought  so i was able to get most of it but it was terribly awkward and i still left some batter  it makes me wonder if these things are tested out in a college dorm  after cooking i drizzled white icing and shook out a cinnamon sugar mixture on top  that s the only thing that made them special  as they would have been pretty plain without the topping  needless to say  i wouldn t buy again  forget the time saver  add a  couple of steps for a much better product ,0,1
689,while i agree that these nuts are quite tasty  the total weight of the eight packs is one pound  thats  26 00 per pound for cashews  i can buy fresh roasted spiced cashews at the local gourmet nut shop for half that and see them roasted right in front of me  very expensive,0,1

687,well  reviews for this drink are all over the place  so i can t say my review is definitive  anyway  this drink met with negative results  here   too sweet and rich  but  it would be best to judge for yourself or look at several reviews  for me  not being a regular coffee drinker  i prefer a cold coca cola or iced tea  rather than any iced coffee drink anytime  plus  at about  2 for a can  too expensive for me   but i m a cheapskate  so keep that in mind  too sweet and rich,0,1

93,i have placed four orders for this tea with amazon  with five shipments   the first one was perfect  and allowed me to discover the superb quality of the tea from the diyagama west estate   while taste is very much a personal matter  this is my favorite ceylon  and i have sampled more than a dozen high end ceylon teas   therefore  even though the tea was relatively expensive  i was sold   soon thereafter i placed a second order   this time i did not receive diyagama west  rather a virtually identical looking package  but that clearly identified that its content was from the kirkoswald estate   also a nice tea  but distinctly different  and  to my taste  nowhere near as sophisticated as the diyagama west   since i opened the package  i used both of them up  and placed my third order  received kirkoswald again  this time i called amazon and tried to correct the problem   amazon was great  as always  they promised to send a replacement of the correct product  the replacement i received was kirkoswald again  then i waited three months or so  and decided to try again   kirkoswald showed up once more   i believe that whatever inventory location is supposed to hold the diyagama has been stocked with kirkoswald  and since the packaging looks so very similar  except for the estate name on the label  this way well remain uncorrected until the current stock runs out  and the bin location is replenished with the correct  diyagama estate product when placing an order with amazon  sophisticated  quick  and easy as it is  there is no way to add a comment or alert to check the box and to not send kirkoswald   the only was to correct a mixup is through customer service after the product has been delivered  so on my fourth order  that is what i did  and amazon  once again  corrected the financial aspect  but i am still without the tea i enjoy the most  consistent fulfillment mixups,0,1
5748,just not the normal flavors i am used to getting  the red ones are hot and spicy like the cinnamon candies  so if you like those and like gum this would be perfect for you  the pink  orange  and yellow dont have a great flavor  i really like the green ones  okay if you like cinnamon candy ,0,1
5525,caribbean joy coconut milk offers a tempting price  lower than its competitors   there s a good reason for its low price  by all accounts it tastes like half the visible amount is coconut milk  the rest being water neither good for pina coladas or cooking  this is a poor value and i can t recommend it to anyone  you get what you pay for,0,1

633,i have to say that i really wanted this formula to work for our son  my husband and i are big whole foods  organic people  and wanted that for our son as well when my milk supply never grew to be sufficient for him  this was clearly imperfect  only breast milk is perfect   but it was organic  and i didn t want my baby consuming chemicals everything worked out fine for about 4 weeks  our son would spit up to some extent after almost every feeding  but we attributed it to him having some issues  not the formula  as he started to better  communicate  with us  we realized that he would cry nonstop during his feedings  which didn t seem normal  he would continue to suck  but would sob through his eating  it was heartbreaking  we burped him incessantly  thinking it may be gas  but it wasn t  he wouldn t sleep because he was so fussy  and nothing would calm him  he had a dirty diaper only once a day  sometimes even less   and they would often be harder than we would have expected after doing extensive research  we started our little one on gerber good start protect  it contains only whey protein and not casein  which is known to create curds in baby s tummy  in anyone s tummy  really   it also has probiotics  like breast milk   when we gave him his first bottle of the new stuff  he saw the bottle and started to pout  and once he started drinking  you could almost see the relief on his face  he did not fuss at all through his feedings  and he was instantly happier and calmer  my smiling  beautiful boy was back  after almost 9 days of naps of an hour or less  he got back to his regular 2 3 hour naps and better sleeping at night while i want my son to have the most wholesome ingredients possible  i believe sometimes the way those ingredients are mixed can be a negative  and i think that may be the case with this formula  we ll continue with our gerber good start  and as much breast milk as possible  one pro  lots of cons   ,0,1

632,i love oil based hair treatments my hair is thick and coarse  so i like the smoothing effect along with the moisture i am a regular user of ojan oil  and argan oil however when i received this product i was disappointed to find the first ingredient is mineral oil do cosmetic companies think we consumers are idiots and don t read labels the scent did not bother me  but don t expect any treatment benefits from this product  who know what percentage of this actually contains more of the nourishing oils like shea  argan and coconut no wonder it is so inexpensive  mineral oil with fragrance,0,1
631,howdy y all i like this cereal  it is not  wonderful  but it is tasty and nicely crunchy   if you don t let it sit for long    grin  i have been buying this 4 pack for some time now and will not be buying any more  why  the 4 pack is no longer available thru amazon prime  that puts a 40  shipping charge on it     a far higher premium than i will pay for convenience amazon now sells this in a 3 pack that  is  available via prime  that is what i will be buying henceforth raisin bran crunch cereal  18 2  ounce boxes  pack of 3 rated a one cuz the new total price is totally off the wall take care lee good ceral at a  very  high non amazon prime total cost,0,1
5524,i love hazelnut spreads and i ve tried many brands from kroeger smith to imported versions and each has their own unique taste and consistency and i like discovery the differences  maybe it was the mocha cappuccino flavor that turned me off  or just jif s less than stellar version it comes in a glass jar and is about ten or twenty cents higher than other local brands available to me but i thought  no one can mess this up  it s chocolate  well  i was wrong  the major issue i have is the fact that when i opened it  a thick layer of oil was sitting right on top  yeah  oil  yellowish oil  well  that s on me since  i should have checked the label and the number first two ingredients are sugar and vegetable oils  i drained that off and stirred it  finding it incredibly soup like  as though it d been sitting under the sun on a hot summer day  the taste is not bad  but it isn t great either  it s very sweet and the mocha flavor does offset it a bit but it has none of that richness or thickness like other versions i ve tried and the mocha flavor is just   off  i ve tried putting it on the usual suspects  like fruit and toasted bread  in no bake cheesecake and hot chocolate  but it just doesn t cut it i can see how some may like it  especially if you ve never tried hazelnut spread but trust me  if you want the real mccoy  try  nutella hazelnut spread  13 ounce plastic jar  pack of 5   by far the best and  at last  accessible and rather affordable   everywhere    nocciolata hazelnut w cocoa   milk  6 9 52 oz  or natural nectar natural chocodream  belgian cocoa spread with hazelnuts  12 3 ounce glass jars  pack of 3   all of which are amazing and sooooo much better  not a fan ,0,1
5112,the most moist  delicious    sustainably caught sardines are  by and far  the wild planet brand i  tried both the  season  and  crown prince  brands and the difference in flavor and quality was light years away from the wild planet brand i live in new england and can only find wild planet brand in my local stop and shop it s amazing that we have 3  whole foods  markets in my state and not one carries the wild planet brand   they are only carry what i believe to be the inferior quality brands that i mentioned i m sure that the hoffman and manischewitz families that own crown prince and season brands wouldn t mind having the wild planet brand alongside their own  since they feel theirs are such great quality  right who knows  they just might learn something about having high standards from the lovely bunch of people that own wild planet in california to top it off  all wild planet products are in bpa free cans   what more can you ask for  quite inferior    ,0,1
5523,my headline pretty much sums it all up  this bigalow green tea is your basic run of the mill  cheap  low quality bagged green tea   it hardly even tastes like actual green tea  it s been so refined   this stuff is definitely  bottom of the barrel   however  it s cheap  and it s better than drinking soda or something  so if this contributes to your lifestyle change  great i recommend looking into a higher quality green tea though   organic  and possibly a matcha variety  basic  low quality green tea ,0,1
5461,the shipping and price was amazing  i just found it too salty to cook a steak on though  maybe i am just using it wrong though  i wish there was better directions  nice bag though  thing is beautiful  amazing price  salt lick,0,1
258,when i opened the package  the salt did not look right  i compared it to some of the himalayan salt i had from whole foods and it was a lighter pink  opened the bag and tasted it  it sure tasted like regular salt was added  great price but you get what you pay for  nice trick  wow what a rip off,0,1
5022,the taste and quality of the pumpkin itself seem fine but this stuff is way runnier than normal pumpkin puree   i ve been making pumpkin pies for years using all sorts of canned puree s and have never had a problem  now with this stuff my thanksgiving pies are like soup   luckily i still have tomorrow morning to go buy a different brand and redo the pies   i guess there is just more water and less pumpkin than most products   if you have the misfortune of having this product  be sure to be very cautious of the amount of liquid you add  too runny,0,1
607,i love this product  its a simple and great margarita  only thing i would change is to add 1l of tequila and not 750ml   the reason this gets 1 star is that it is marked up 150   i can buy this for   9 dollars at the grocery or hardware store  granted that is pricing for 1 bucket and this is for two  don t buy this product here  see if you can find it locally or at another amazon seller or website entirely  way over priced ,0,1
5462,i really love the fruity version of these crisps so i was excited once they came out with both chocolate and cinnamon versions  but they were a big disappointment   for whatever reason  the flavor just isn t as good   however  you should try the blueberry or strawberry versions  not as delicious,0,1

5314,i wanted to try something new and this is new alright  while i love and appreciate the design  the flavor is less than desirable  it s too bitter  i drink my coffee black and really enjoy a strong cup of dark roast  but after discovering i didn t care for the flavor  i tried to disguise it with the flavor of creamer i knew i d like  coconut cream  yum  and still the flavor of the bitter coffee was just too much  great design  not so great flavor,0,1
5007,first the good   this cat litter is decently priced  clumps fairly well  and is finer than other litters  cats tend to like fine litters better  the bad   the scent is very strong   people may not notice it as much but cats have a lot more sensitive noses and they can definitely tell   in my experience from using this with many cats at our local animal shelter  only the more picky ones have actually gone outside of their litterbox rather than use this litter  but the majority don t like it and try to stay on the opposite side of the cage   cats really prefer unscented litter  and this is one of the more smelly litters we have tried   this litter is also a little more dusty than other litters because of its strong scent  it does do a good job of masking odor   it basically comes down to your need to mask odor versus your cat s comfort   at the animal shelter  the cats  comfort is our priority  so we choose not to use this litter   overall  i would not recommend buying this litter unless your cat isn t picky at all  would not recommend  cats don t like strong scent   ,0,1
276,i tried eb s other meals and this was not as good  i love their fruits and veggies but this gourmet stuff  my son would not eat  and some of them just didnt smell delicious  i would definitely try one of them from the supermarket before committing to buy 12  not as great as i thought it would be,0,1
5320,i buy this for my cat   i add vitamins   vegies and make my own wet cat food for sadie the cat   i tried it once to make a tuna salad sandwich but it was tuna paste by the time i added onion   mayo   really not enjoyable for me but my cat ate it all  5 stars for cat food but 2 stars for human consumption,0,1
275,we hadn t been able to find our favorite lobster base at surfas  la   they ve been out of stock since the first of the year   so  following the reviews here  i bought a jar of better than boullion lobster bast   6 19 at bristol farms   tasted it   it s not good  no way can it be compared with custom culinary s  with only a hint of lobster  dark red color  and tasting strongly of tomato paste  it won t do here   surprisingly  better than boullion has an excellent chicken base and their ham base if good too   had i looked farther down the page  i would have noticed that amazon also carries the custom culinary  gold label  lobster base  which is the brand we had been using   yes  it s more than 3 times as expensive  but a bigger jar  much less need be used at one time  and the flavor is a world of improvement   really tastes like lobster and enhances everything from fish chowder to thermador  better than bullion but worse than the custom culinary s,0,1
558,i have 6 large dogs and 2 are sensitive to kibble  sure enough after 1 week of this kibble with their raw food they began to scratch  i realize all the ingredients looked great and are organic but our dogs still had issues with it  just goes to show you that dogs are not kibbleavoires but fresh food omnivoires   you can t go wrong feeding a balanced species appropriate diet  still kibble    ,0,1

58,the flavor does do a good job of capturing the character of a cinnamon roll  but these are more sugary sweet than regular frosted mini wheats   it really captures the cinnamon flavor  and some of the smoothness  but the sugar overwhelmed these traits   i did like the smaller size bits too overall  this a little to sweet for even an occasional treat  much less a regular breakfast  very sugary,0,1

5009,i picked up a pouch of this soup at a local market just recently   i have always loved a good minestrone soup and make it home made a lot   however like many others at times i like to keep it quick and easy  and a ready in no time bag of stock and fixens often fits the bill nicely   unfortunately this soup was quick and easy all right  but that is pretty much where most of the goodness of it ended   the recipe calls for 6 cups of water plus a 15oz can of tomato sauce   i opted for only 5 cups of water since i prefer a thicker  heartier soup   but as i mixed it all together it was obvious as it simmered that this was going to be a really loose watery soup  even with using less water than directed   oh  the pouch has a nice list of ingredients on it  including pasta  bell pepper  onion  celery  etc  but both the size and quantity of them all  leaves much to be desired   the stock itself was not bad   it was not overly salty  was mildly spicy and tasted passable enough   but with every spoonful that s pretty much what you got every time   a lot of stock with a few pitiful pieces of fixens floating around in it   like all soup mixes  the pouch recommends some stir in suggestions   like sausage  hamburger  beans  and cabbage for example   but in my opinion if you want to enjoy a hearty soup for dinner on some cold night at all with this  plan on a stir in suggestion being not an option  but a must   and even then i suggest you use less than the 6 cups of water suggested   an even more sensible option is to forget this entirely and opt for a much better choice for a pouch style soup mix in the bear creek brand minestrone  available here on amazon  and in lots of local markets   its decently hearty all by itself  and is superior with some meat or other suggestion tossed in   and you even get more stock and fixens for about the same price as this cuginos brand   all in all i cannot recommend this mix   either try the bear creek or other mix  or go home made        ok stock    really disappointing on fixens ,0,1

5527,it is appalling to read some of the misinformation on this product especially the one with the highest helpful score by heather l  parisi  robert and heather parisi     parisi has written the same review for swanson as well as twinlab  twinlab has not even specified the chromium and selenium even on their internet site and the nutritional value is not even presented clearly at all  a good brewer s yeast should provide the needed information not only on their internet site but on the package labelling   1  brewer s yeast does not contain vitamin b12  an essential vitamin found in meat and dairy products  vegetarians sometimes take brewer s yeast mistakenly believing that it provides b12  which can be lacking in their diet  one tablespoon of spirulina offers 67  vitamin b12 in comparison to 2  in brewer s yeast  regardless  i get my b12 from sardines  sprats and salmon 2  unlike ordinary brewer s yeast  which is grown on grain and hops liquor  brewer s yeast which is called nutritional yeast is derived from the  sugar beets not hops  barley or grain 3  a good brewer s yeast should be unbleached  untreated  not fortified  not blended  non gmo  nothing added and specify 100  brewer s yeast 4  one tablespoon of brewer s yeast  15gr  provides me with 70  chromium and 45  selenium  i am into very healthy diet and different sports from mountain biking  surfing  weight lifting  hiking  etc  without any need for any meds for any chronic condition  although i get selenium from brazil nuts  chromium is hard to get due to the depletion of the nutrients in soil  brewer s yeast offers me other benefits like keeping glucose down  healthy skin especially when i am exposed to the sun without any sun protection since i want to get my vitamin d naturally  increasing hdl and lowering ldl  vitamin b complex and some vegetable protein 5  protein in brewer s yeast is a vegetable protein and not as complete in amino acids as the protein in dairy product like eggs  milk  cheese and yogurt  quinoa offers me more complete protein for less money  i consume unflavored whey protein isolate for weight lifting even though i consume fish and dairy products but no beef or chicken  do your research   ,0,1

5014,have been ordering this royal canin product from amazon for some time   our dog loves the food and has done really well with it for months   has had skin allergy problems in the past but they have improved dramatically since he started on this product   will not continue to order after the more than  10 per bag increase in price   more than a 30  increase in price over the past 2 months is not acceptable to us   ordering a different product tonight   sorry royal canin    great product    bad business   great product   bad business  ,0,1
219,i love the idea of amazon delivering things like this direct to my door  and my dog cody loves it  but then again  he ll eat about anything  he s outside this very moment trying to catch   eat cicadas  so he s not exactly a connoisseur  however  i have some problems with this product  first  the price is a bit high  currently  21 on amazon  but only  15 at target or walmart  second  i really question the quality of ingredients  in the first 10 or 15 ingredients  there are only  two  real foods   wheat is  5 and beef is  7  and i m not even certain that wheat is an essential ingredient  otherwise it s all filler  corn is not good for dogs  not digestible for any mammals  actually   sugar is not good for dogs  chicken  by product  means ground up bones  fat  tendons  things like that  and  there are a lot of petroleum based dyes  preservatives  etc most importantly  for about the same price   1 35 per pound   you can buy the good stuff  for example  prairie natural dry dog food is only  1 48 per pound my recommendation  regardless whether you feed your pet the cheap stuff or not  is to supplement your pet s diet with scraps from your kitchen  we never ever feed our dog from the table or while we re cooking  but instead we ll peel the fat off chicken or keep little chunks of veggies   keep it in the fridge for his next meal  this will save you money and ensure your dog gets some fresh foods in his her diet  some essential enzymes  etc  dog loves it  price is a bit high  question the quality of ingredients,0,1
5024,i bought this rawhide for my english bulldog who loves to chew   i was very hesitant about rawhides with a previous bulldog due to the fact that pieces can be bitten off and choked on   this bulldog is a chewer and i need to have something for him to chew on   i only allow him to have rawhides when i am here to watch him   he had this rawhide for 10 minutes and already had a piece big enough to choke on in his mouth and i had to dig it out   i have given it to him 3 different times for about 10 15 minutes and he already had more than half of it gone   i was hoping based on reviews that this would last longer than this   the positive is he does love it and it seems to curb his chewing  but i just wished it would last longer than this  disappointed,0,1
404,i got these because i have heard about them from a lot of breastfeeding moms  i used them for a month and noticed a very tiny increase in my supply  but for the entire month my baby pooped 6 8 times a day  she was fussy and always blowing out her diapers  i didn t make the connection at first and then decided to stop taking them  after a day she went back to pooping normally and wasn t as fussy i was taking 2 capsules  3 times a day  i barely noticed an increase in supply and it made my daughter very gassy and uncomfortable  i was really hoping this would help but it just didn t work for me  a let down,0,1

568,i ve been watching a lot of british tv on netflix lately   show after show mentions marmite lovingly   i had to know what all the talk was about   it s possible that the talk is because the british all joke about how bad it tastes   they put this stuff on their toast so  i was expecting jelly or  marm alade   hokey smokes some cultural sensibilities are different   we like you  britain  glad the queen has 60 years under her belt and everything   we re glad marmite is working out well for you but  americans apparently left for a reason  am i eating spoiled marmite ,0,1
263,the picture on the bag of the food looks really healthy  one can only assume by the name they are trying to push a better food product for our beloved pets i mean chef michael s  how can someone not buy it  it has to be great my dog ate it quickly  but then again  my dog isn t a picky eater i had a bag of blue buffalo  i try to feed my dog better food  here are the list of the first few ingredients  deboned chicken  chicken meal  whole ground brown rice  whole ground barley  oatmeal     etc  etc this is what is in the chef michael s  beef  soybean meal  soy flour  animal fat preserved with mixed tochpherols eh whats that   brewers rice  soy protein concentrate etc  etc as you can see there is a big difference  while the food looks decent  its softer  the brown stuff looks like meat  and it has bits of yellow brown and green hard nuggets while your dog will probably eat it  i d say spend the extra 4 bucks and get a bag of something better  its  13 87 in the store for a for a 4 5 pound bag   i think i paid  17 00 for a 6 pound bag of bb  or something a little healthier bottom line is that each pet owner must choose what they think is best for their four legged buddy  read the ingredients,0,1

132,i have a 1 5 yr old golden who loves to chew  these raw hides are tightly rolled up like the others have mentioned and he has to chew through the whole thing  luckily it doesnt crumble up like another packet i bought from amazon by another seller  however  they are messy like any other raw hide and the package also looks different from the picture shown  overall a good product and will definitely order again i had written the above review immediately after receiving the raw hides  and my golden was vigorously chewing through them all  however i started noticing that he used to fall sick the day after he consumed it  i used to give him only one a week   so i ve stopped giving it to him now  they are just sitting in my house  and iv switched to pork chomps  which are pork rolls and are 100  digestible  dog fell sick,0,1
458,i wanted to title my review  happy hair  because my 9 year old loves this conditioner   my medium thick long hair could take it or leave it  but counter to my expectations  her baby fine hair became extra gleamy and managable   she says it gives her  happy hair  the problem  once i started looking at the ingredients  is that it s chock full of synthetics and silicones  which  oddly enough  can be skin irritants and possibly cause dermatitis in some people   i m not so sure that this is what you call  nourishing the scalp   it s more of a situation in which you apply silicone to the hair shaft to make it shiny   so  i m referring to the cyclopentasiloxane  stearamdo propyl dimethylamine  dimethiconol  etc   it s a long way down the list before you get to the nourishing shea butter and coconut oil i guess if i want to nourish my scalp  i could always use pure coconut oil  then shampoo it out   for what it s worth  i try to keep ingredients natural with my kids  real or fake ,0,1

5636,i agree with other reviews regarding the very high spice levels in this syrup   i normally like a lot of cinnamon  nutmeg  allspice  etc but this syrup had too much for me   the syrup smells like it will have more pumpkin flavor  but that is not delivered in taste amended review 10 25 12   this company is better at customer service than any other consumer food company i have dealt with   perhaps it is due to the strong customer orientation in the part of their business selling high end products to bakeries  food service operations and food companies   i got a call the same day as i filed my original review   on that call i learned that their syrups are more concentrated so i need to make sure i go easy on the pumps   because they are concentrated and less sweet   they have only 35 calories per serving which is much less than other syrups and makes it easier to use on my greek yogurt   i also learned they are working on a third version of a pumpkin syrup which says a lot about how responsive they are to consumer feedback   to make sure i understood they make high quality products  they also sent me some samples of their other lines which were all very tasty so if you see a product from amoretti that you are interested in  give it a try   it is probably very good   if it turns out the flavor is not to your liking  the company will make it right as they did for me  lots of spice  not much pumpkin  but wow great customer service,0,1
261,i have been ordering jasmine tea from various suppliers for a few years now   i found this to be some of the best priced dragon pearl jasmine tea around   the jasmine scent is definitely  on the weak side   i believe this is due to the number of times the tea is  scented    in addition  the tea is shipped in a tin that is not vacuum packed   over time  the tea will lose its jasmine scent if it is not sealed properly   i would recommend this tea if you are on a budget and you are an amazon prime member  free shipping    if you are a jasmine tea aficionado  shop elsewhere   i give 3 stars for the price update    after using this tea for a couple weeks now  the jasmine scent has almost completely dissipated   i have adjusted my rating to 2 stars  fair tea for the price,0,1

5294,i ve been researching orgain online trying to figure out what happened considering i used to live on it but now can no longer even find it  like many of the other reviews mention   i lived on this stuff for breakfast and would purchase it by the case for months  i immediately noticed the flavor change that other reviews have mentioned  i always ordered the chocolate flavor  and agree the new ingredient flavor change was not for the better  i was very disappointed then i suddenly realized that orgain was no longer available at all in my local whole foods where i used to find it in both the shelf and chilled sections of the store  i then noticed that my  subscribe   save  case shipping from amazon quit shipping entirely after a years on going subscription  i mentioned this to the friend who first introduced me to orgain only to hear her tell me that our very popular and local vegetarian grocery store  rainbow grocery  has also quit selling it  i assumed that orgain went out of business but i am still finding it online here at amazon  just no longer with subscribe   save option    and the official website appears to be up and running  with whole foods still quite confusingly being listed as a retail provider   i checked another whole foods retail store in another city and they  too  have quit selling this product which leads me to believe that whole foods has backed out entirely super frustrated and really disappointed on all counts  i am actively seeking  like other customers  a new replacement  i tried muscle milk the other day    gross  highly disappointed in sudden flavor change   store unavailability,0,1

414,i ve been using another brand  ordered online  for several years  so i know that product very well   i use it in all foods in place of sugar   i like coffee for dessert  so used 3 drops per cup  which is much sweeter than most people like it  i ordered this product only because it was a good price and it comes in multiples of a small size bottle  to keep in different locations    i had to use at least 8 drops to equal the sweetness i m used to  there s obviously a lot more water in this brand    hence the lower price  i assume  maybe this wouldn t matter to some   but it was a deal breaker for me  not as concentrated  as my usual brand,0,1

57,i ve seen a lot of products on here and not only do i cringe but i criticize people when they complain about the taste of food for various reasons  i purchased this  solely for awesome  healthy  thick and colorful bowel movements  i wanted them  but wasn t getting them  so i ate this and in terms of flavor  any flavor  give me a snap crackle or pop  i received nothing  my tongue and body were analyzing it as if it were an alien  i thought  the solution was easy  grab some toppings and that should take care of the problem  right  so i put peanuts in the cereal  like an elephant  and the cereal was so strong in its stubborn ways like kryptonite  it made the peanuts bland  so i said  ok fine  we re going to have to get the big guns here  i went out and purchased honey  the major religious books talk about milk and honey all the time  you can t get more sweeter and flavorful than honey  i put a significant amount of honey in my bowl and the forces were so strong with this one  it devoured the distinct flavor of honey like a fat kid devours a cake when left alone in a room  so  every time thereafter when i consumed cereal bowls of this product  it would be like a contest  i d have a contest with myself  the contest would be  how fast and efficient can i be in consuming this with a spoon  and i d set a record and the next day  when i d eat it again  i d try to beat that record like a marathon  training for the olympics  ten big spoonfuls one day  maybe nine or eight the next  and the thing is  i didn t notice any bowel improvement  i expected unicorns and vibrant rainbows to come out of my a   and it was like a wasteland just decimated with poverty  hopelessness and abandonment  i gave the cereal two stars instead of one because i presume this has some healthy benefits with the flaxseed and the whole grains and whatnot  if you don t believe me that s fine  purchase this and bring a sword to the table  you re going to do battle with the dragon  my friend  blandest thing i ve ever tasted  and i m hard on those who complain about their food,0,1

4988,the thing that i like best about this product is the container   it is a compact  convenient way to use loose sweetener at home rather than all of those paper packets   the downside of the container is that measuring 1 4 tsp  can become more cumbersome and inaccurate than convenient   as for flavor  there is little advantage over other sweeteners on the market   sugar is a significant ingredient along with erythritol   this sugar alcohol has minimal impact on diabetic blood sugar levels but can cause problems for people with ibs or sensitive guts   other reviewers commented on the extreme sweetness but that was not my experience when using it with oatmeal   1 4 tsp  of nectresse was not discernable while 1 tsp  of sugar added just a touch of sweetness with no aftertaste   this product left a decidedly unpleasant residual taste when added to coffee   all in all there was little about nectresse that would get me to consider buying it or to recommend it to anyone else   i suspect that this is more about increasing sales in a sweetner saturated market than it is about providing a particularly unique product  marketing trumps product value,0,1

92,this scent would be good if you re at the gym or playing a sport and are trying to cover up your stink around other men  but  overall  not the best scent in the axe line i would suggest temptation by axe to refresh at the office or going out as it is a much more attractive scent that s a mix of citrus and bubble gum old spice has its place  but not for most things  the smell is a strong brut old spice smell,0,1

5644,i bought the smoother because i thought i needed one to make my daughters birthday cake  honestly i think i could have done the same thing with my hand   really if the cake was smooth  you could do it close to smooth   the cost is small enough where if you think you need one get one   but i m not sure i would repurchase in the future if it broke or i lost it   quality is that it is very thick and seems sturdy    just again not sure that i would ever really need one  useful ,0,1
5133,i just finished my last box of this tried and true cereal  so opened my new order of 4 boxes   low and behold  they have changed the formula and it no longer fits into my low carb life style    how infuriating  new nutrition facts   total carb 19g  was 14g  fiber 3g  was 5g  sugar 7g  was 2g  calories for 3 4 cup 120  was 100  sodium 190mg  was 110mg  potassium 125mg  was 280mg   protein remains 10g for both  total fat 1g  was 3g  calories from fat 10  was 25 amazon doesn t allow returning of food products  so my daughter in law offered to try this cereal  she s on low calorie diet   why would they change this cereal after so many years   i m miffed  mad as hades   ,0,1
126,i bought this honey substitute and a bottle of nature s hollow honey substitue for a side by side comparison with honey tree imitation honey  which i have used for years  i believe this product has a slightly slimy texture and  mouth feel   it also lacked the pronounced honey flavor i find in the honey tree  although it does not cause the gas  problem  that can occur with large comsumption of honey tree  i believe i will stay with honey tree  note  i have used honey tree as a base for pecan pie  instead of karo syrup  and it was just okay  excess gas was a definite problem as i always eat a large slice of pecan pie  i intend to make a pie with the natrazyle  if it is better than the honey tree i will report back  low flavor ,0,1

5542,if you want your dog to have yeast infections and allergies  go ahead and buy this crap  i got a new dog about 3 weeks ago and was told she doesn t have allergies at all  her fur was full  skin intact  no redness was apparent when i got her and her feet paws looked good  the only reason i bought this food  not on amazon  was because my other dog s stool was looking pretty good on rachel ray s just 6 diet and i purchased in error because i thought it was the same thing  but i looked more closely at the ingredients later on and realized there are many more fillers and now even his ears started getting stinky in the last 2 weeks   with the new girl  i was steadily switching over her from science diet to this poison  i was realizing she seemed more and more itchy and there was a lot of redness and smelly feet  after getting some advice from other dog owners i decided to go cold turkey and switch to natural balance lid for the girl and within 4 days of switching foods  itchiness has subsided and feet are less red  inflamed  and stinky  as far as my boy  he is now on a combo of newman s regular and wellness grain free  and he loves it and stool looks great  all i can say is invest in your dog s diet  read the reviews of the popular brands  and there will probably a lot less trips to the vet which means a happier dog and savings  it makes me so angry that there are so many bad dog foods out there  i will also be supplementing their food with an oil too as i have read many great reviews about that too and how it improves their health  poison for dogs,0,1
5645,i purchased iams canned because our previous siamese of 19 years loved it  but our current siamese tastes it and then walks away  she eats turkey and giblets in other brands  so it s not a meat she doesn t like  i don t know if they have changed the flavor or if this cat is just finicky  but i gave it 2 stars  because if your cat will eat it  it is a very good quality cat food  my siamese won t eat it ,0,1

5603,green mountain has a reputation for making great coffee and i routinely have my favorites shipped to me   but this blend is way too weak for me my favorite coffee is barista prima coffeehouse  italian roast  24  count k cup portion pack for keurig brewers and when i want something slightly weaker i drink timothy s world coffee  extra bold rainforest espresso  k cups for keurig brewers  24 count box  pack of 2    for the extended family  however  i keep medium  mild  decaf  and flavored coffees available   the house favorite for medium is wolfgang puck coffee  breakfast in bed  medium roast    24 count k cups for keurig brewers i brewed this k cup strong and tried it first without cream   it had a definite coffee aroma but the taste was weak and unusual  not bad but grain     i then added 1 2 my usual cream and that actually made it worse   i suppose if i drank it together with some sweet pastry it would taste fine but  by itself  it s just not appealing to me i suggest  if you need extra vitamin c and e  you buy a better tasting coffee and drink it with a good multivitamin  green mountain stumbled with this one,0,1

155,if you are pondering whether or not to purchase this product   first mostly  do your research  the reviews on this state some insects were caught   however  some say they weren t effective  just take a moment and realize that yes  they cost cheap   however  did you know that they use pheromone technology  did you know that pheromone s only work on certain types of insects  for instance  sure you can get a pheromone to attract women but however  only a few women will respond to the pheromone product for women  this concludes that pheromones that this product contains is less effective with certain insects  if your home is infested with centipedes and home spiders   the best recommendation that has worked for my wife and i is raid barrier  it s very effective and over for a past week we seen dramatic results in the reduction amount of spiders and centipedes  you may have greater results by spraying raid around the outside and some inside  isolated rooms   do yourself a favor and pass this product up and go now purchase raid barrier  works like a charm and will keep your home safe and comfortable  ineffective,0,1
5138,i keep trying to like these  natural  sweeteners  but they always come up short in the flavor category  this is another one that  like stevia  i find has a bitter aftertaste  also  with the main ingredient simply a more processed version of sugar  i m not really seeing any advantage to using nectresse over other highly processed sweeteners like splenda nice container though  more bitter tasting than splenda  and no more  natural ,0,1
5058,the gum is mildly sweet so the ginseng flavor is quite overwhelming   you would figure that to be true in the product  but i expected more sweetness like ginseng soda which i do enjoy   i can t get my family to chew it  so this package is going to take awhile  you ve got to like the flavor of ginseng a lot,0,1

5248,i use coconut milk daily and this is the only coconut milk i buy because i appreciate that native forest uses bpa free cans and is organic i ve been buying this from amazon for over a year  i used to buy it on subscription before they canceled subscription availability up till now there has never been a problem with my orders  but yesterday i received my latest 12 pack and every single can in it is dented  four had very minor dents near the top  but eight cans had large noticeable dents while i imagine that the product inside is probably fine  i am very concerned about this lapse in quality control in the manufacturing and or distibution process  dents can weaken the metal and introduce tiny cracks that allow contamination of the product i notice a lot of very recent comments on amazon stating that others are receiving dented cans as well  i hope amazon and or native forest will address this i am not sure if it s a distribution problem  if the cans are being damaged in shipping  they came double boxed from amazon  so perhaps damage occurs further upstream in the shipping line   or if amazon is only managing to source damaged cans in the first place  or     i want to offer full stars for the product  which i like and truly rely on  but i m offering a low rating because of the packaging  all 12 cans dented  love this product long time buyer of it  this is my first problem with it ever,0,1
5230,i grew up with maggi in our household as my parents were from germany and always had a way of getting the good old  maggi gew uuml rz  shipped to us and keeping stock in our kitchen   the original seasoning is great  but this one is a little different  trust me i know   it is made in mexico and for a fact the ingredients are a little different  there are more preservatives in this one than the original  thus the taste is not quite the same  a little disappointed,0,1
643,so  i snagged a jar of this at my local whole foods  because it had been recommended to me as supplying full peanut butter satisfaction with a fraction of the fat and calories   well   i didn t read the ingredient and nutritional info till i got home   it has stuff in it like  grain syrup    what s that   tapioca syrup   vegetable glycerin  and dehydrated cane juice  more sugar    so maybe it s because i ve been eating sugar free peanut butter for a while  but this stuff is really sweet   like tooth achingly  diabetic shock inducing sweet   it also has a nasty chemical undertaste  and a lot of salt   13 g carbs  4 g protein  2 g fat  190 mg sodium  100 calories in the same conversation where so called  better n peanut butter  was recommended to me  another person recommended pb2  powdered peanut butter   85  less fat and calories   16 oz  which is a mixture of defatted peanut flour  sugar and salt   three ingredients  in that order   granted  it comes in powder form  so you have to reconstitute it  2 tbsp peanut powder to 1 tbsp water   mix it up for a couple seconds  and it tastes like peanut butter   no discernible sweetness or excessive salinity  no chemical undertaste   5 g carbs  5 g protein  1 5g fat 94 mg sodium  45 calories   it s a wee bit more trouble cuz you have to mix it as needed   but it s also delicious  unlike  better n peanut butter    oh  and available at amazon at roughly the same price  considering that when a pound of pb2 is reconstituted with water  it makes about two pounds of tasty peanut butter  better n what peanut butter ,0,1
5003,i have to admit  this is probably one of the best sugar free hot chocolate s i ve ever tried   that said  it s an adequate replacement for the real thing at best   i usually drink a big mug with 2 packets  so i ll probably use one packet and some of this   however for over  10 a can i m not impressed     totally not worth it      taste   3 stars   price  1 star ,0,1

281,long time online shopper  but first time ever writing a review  we have a 7 month old great dane pup  when we got her at 12 weeks  the breeder had her eating holistic select giant breed puppy food  which was good for awhile  then her stool became very loose  so upon reading other reviews we switched to eagle pack giant breed puppy food  her stool was still a little loose  but we thought that it was possibly the switch of the foods so we wanted to give it a chance  well after about 5 30lb  bags of eagle pack  her stool was still very loose and she was eating her and our other dogs poop   very gross to be kissed by that    yuck  a friend told us that she was doing that because she was missing a vitamin or supplement in her diet  she was also consuming a tremendous amount of food as well as always voraciously hungry  we started researching what to do then all of the sudden she was having uncontrollable diarrhea  not good for a 100lb  puppy  we did not have time for anymore research we had to do something now we ended up at a local store and discovered chicken soup for the puppy lover s soul large breed puppy dry dog food  we decided to try a a 18lb bag  even though the protein levels were a couple percentage points higher than we had been told to give a great dane  but the list of ingredients was wonderful when compared with a lot of other top brands  i am no expert but just reading the long list of ingredients it seemed that they had more all natural ingredients  as opposed to the supplements that the others were putting in their food we got it home and immediately made a complete switch from the eagle pack food she was on  we did not do the customary blending of foods for a week or so to introduce the new food and ween her off the old  we did not have time as her tummy was so upset  we also did not want anymore of the eagle pack in her system  she loved the taste and gobbled it up  within about 24 hours her poops started to firm up a bit  this got progressively better as the week went by  but still a little soft as to make picking up difficult especially on grass  we added in clover fresh digest daily intestinal aid for dogs to her food and presto she pretty much has a firm stool every time  she is also eating noticeably less food  yay      which she seams to be getting better nourishment from it  she is also no longer eating poop  yay      we attribute that the little bit extra protein in this food is what she was missing from her diet  we are going to ween her off the in clover fresh digest daily intestinal aid for dogs and see how she does without the supplement now that she is totally use to her new food to sum it up 1  good quality ingredients2  less supplements than some other brands3  slightly higher protein than we would like  but it keeps her from eating poop so that is ok4  affordable5  retains more of the food so she eats less  which saves a fair amount of money 6  her coat is super shiny and healthyp s  we also switched our senior citizen american bulldog to the eagle pack adult food  and she got a very loose stool as well  and she has never been loose a day in her life  we now have her on chicken soup for the dog lover s soul large breed dry dog food  and she is great and very healthy as well  not good food,0,1
5089,i usually make my own baby food but for convenience i tried a number of these when i went travelling and although she would eat them   she basically eats anything   she didn t gobble them up like fresh proper food   i tasted them and they really aren t that nice   she also started  get diaper rash for the first time ever  every time i fed her these  and it cleared up every time i stopped basically they are good if you have no alternative  but nothing beats homemade   they taste kind of nasty and processed and the kid could tell   plus a lot of the nutrients will have been processed out if them in the canning process   so not the best thing to feed your child long term generally   making your food and freezing it isn t so much hassle  not like the real thing,0,1

50,stevia sweetened colas has finally come of age and i love many zevia flavors but this one has a strange and unappetizing taste after swallowing it   now my 5 year old likes it so theres a critic in the house who differs with me some  anyhow   but seriously it needs more work to get the flavor to something not so odd and unlikable  love this line of products    but this one needs a little improvement,0,1
384,this is a b i g package  and it looks great  however  the contents leave much to be desired  first  i take exception to the fact that the products are just sitting in each box  with the exception of the final large one which houses the teddy bear and has some crushed paper at the bottom to protect it   some tissue would help relieve the bare bones look of each box s contents  second  better than half the products are just not all that tasty  the sonoma jacks pepper jack is really unpleasant   packaged in wedges in a round container  the cheese has an unpleasant  wet texture and isn t at all appealing  the tavolare snack is just odd  the smoked almonds have an overly salty baconish taste  and the pretzels are also overly salty  the best things are the licorice petites  the fleur de sel caramel popcorn  which was my absolute favorite  and the raspberry snaps  i suspect this is an expensive gift and based on my taste samplings  i wouldn t recommend it  looks better than it is,0,1
5618,i tried to learn to like the taste  but it did not happen  no matter how hard i tried   the coffee has a strange aroma and after taste  like some sort of a strong chemical   and i have been drinking italian espressos all my life   after i ran out of the 4 bricks  i also stopped getting the runs and stomach pains every morning   no more rushing to the toilet after breakfast   i initially believed i was beginning to have unknown health problems  but after quitting this coffee  i realized that my health was fine   for some reason it worked out terribly for me   espresso drinking has always been a ritual of delight for me   aroma  color  taste  and the feel good effect after drinking the coffee should all combine to bring forth a unique moment of goodness  not good   ,0,1

114,we wanted a deodorizing pet cologne that lasted on our dog  especially since he s a water dog   our local groomer recommended this   i was glad to see in the product description that the scent lasted between baths   i was shocked when it truly only lasted about 1 2  a day on the dog   we can spray him in the morning  and by afternoon  that wonderful scent is gone   he s back to smelling like a wet dog   the scent of this product  by the way  is great   we just wished it lasted as long as it claims  does not last,0,1
2569,note   this product probably works best if you are going to put them in a thermos  but it doesn t work that well if just placed in a coffee cup i purchased these back when it was a kickstarter campaign i m the type of person who likes a hot cup of coffee and i tend to sip slowly so i find myself going to the microwave to heat up my cup all the time   i thought this would be the perfect solution i did follow instructions to warm them up first   i would pour boiling water over them for 4 minutes while my press pot coffee brewed  i would then pour out the water from the cup and pour my coffee onto the now hot joulies for me  there was absolutely no noticeable difference in how fast my coffee got cold   so i d have to go through the extra step of pouring the coffee into a different cup so i could microwave it as the joulies can t be microwaved   what a pain i tried them every day for a week to make sure i wasn t doing something wrong and then put them in a drawer someplace where unused kitchen gadgets go to die i tried them in a thermos a few times and they seems to work ok  thus the 2 stars  but i don t really use a thermos all that often   so  for my purposes  keeping a cup of coffee hot  they did absolutely nothing  meh   ,0,1
4916,this product arrived as a birthday gift   after chilling it as instructed  i attempted to drink some   the first thought that came to mind as it hit my palate was sea water   salty   then lemony sourness followed   not a sugary taste that i was expecting   no this does not taste sweet at all and had the sourness approaching that of a lemon it has a strange but interesting aroma that is not at all bad   in fact i felt drawn to smell several more times trying to put a name on the unexpected yet familiar complex aroma   it reminds me  of a bologna sandwich on white bread with overpowering hints of celery if you are not used to this kind of drink  i will say that it is probably much more of an acquired taste from wikipedia   350 algam is a popular beverage from southern turkey s cities of adana and mersin  although the turkish word   351 algam literally means  turnip     351 algam is actually made with the juice of red carrot pickles  salted  spiced  and flavoured with aromatic turnip  elem  fermented in barrels with the addition of ground bulgur  it is traditionally served cold in large glasses with long slices of pickled carrots  called tane  or in some accents  dene   hot paprika relish is added just before drinking  hot or regular  it is a popular drink with adana kebab   350 algam is often served with rak  305   alcoholic beverage   not mixed  but rather in a separate glass  while   350 algam is commonly used to cure hangovers  consuming excess amounts may cause bloating  turkish sweet turnip juice  salgam ,0,1
3364,my daughter gets dry scalp and so i thought i would have her try this  but there are no directions on the container   what is up with that  i don t understand why the company would think that everyone knows how to use these products by the looks of it when i opened it up  it seems more like a balm  so i assume it goes on dry hair  not wet hair in the shower  but we weren t sure whether it is suppose to be rubbed into the scalp  or just smoothed onto hair  my daughter tried rubbing some into her scalp  but wasn t overly thrilled with it  so she just started smoothing a little on her hair  she likes smooth  straight hair  and kind of liked how this balm looked  but not as much as other smoothing products she s used  so i doubt she will continue to keep using this product  we both are still wondering if we are even using it right  i think it s silly for them to not give better directions  confusing,0,1
3363,i have color treated hair and wanted to try this conditioner in combination with clear scalp   hair beauty total care nourishing shampoo  12 9 fluid ounce in hopes of keeping damage from color treatments at a minimum   the shampoo works great and i continue to use it but this conditioner leaves my hair frizzy and unmanageable   i wondered if the combination of the two was causing my problems but i have since used the conditioner with alberto vo5 tea therapy healthful green tea smoothing shampoo  15 ounce and my hair is still frizzy and unmanageable so it s not my shampoo causing the problem   something in the conditioner doesn t agree with my hair and i do not like it  not for me     ,0,1

3348,i was really surprised that our dog actually seemed to like this   usually  he is extremely picky about his food  and he normally does not like anything not chicken   however  he seemed to enjoy this   i thought that was great  until i checked out the ingredients   while beef is listed first  which is important  the two next listed are soy and soy by products   while they do have value as proteins  the value is no where near that of real meat  and the price per ounce is higher than what i pay for a dog food with lots more real protein value   when it comes to dog food  all protein is not created equal   if your dog is larger or a working breed  this food really will not give him the best protein bang for your money   most of the other ingredients are filler and empty calories  i think the coloring is a real poor choice   the artificial chemicals used in coloring dog food are really just added to make the human consumer feel that the food is better balanced and has more variety  the color has no positive impact on the health of the dog   i prefer to stick with more natural and healthy ingredients   not to mention that with the higher price per ounce  it is less filling and the dog will want to eat even more of it to fill the need for real protein   while it may taste good to him  i would rather give him healthier food that is a better deal money wise and health wise   i will let him eat it  since he does seem to enjoy it  but i am thinking of it more as a treat type item  and definitely not a regular part of his diet  the dog liked it  but i didn t ,0,1

1953,i soak black beans overnight and use a pressure cooker to cook them  i ve had very poor results with this brand time after time  some beans are overcooked and mushy while others are undercooked and crunchy  i ve tried different soaking times and different cooking techniques with the pressure cooker and always end up with beans that aren t evenly cooked  i ve had other brands cook up just fine  so the only thing i can think is that the issue is with this particular brand  uneven texture after cooking,0,1

1966,i have used this for almost a month and while it feels nice going on  i have actually noticed my scalp is more dry and i notice more flakes than ever before i don t think this is the right product for me  but it may be that others will notice a similar reaction  definitely not worth the money i would go with neutrogena t gel or t sal then use an intensive moisturizing conditioner as a follow up and of course rinse well also  using shampoo every day is actually not good at all  this product recommends that  but it s better to wash every 2 3 days  your natural oils are there for a reason  stripping them away does more harm than good  i am noticing increasing dandruff,0,1

3316,i began using this product soon after the clear scalp   hair shampoo and conditioner  love those products  don t like this one first  it gives you no clue how to use it  do you use a little  a lot  do you rinse it  or is it a leave in product the packaging doesn t tell you after some experimentation and web research  i decided it seems to be a leave in product if you use it  which i don t recommend  do so sparingly  it makes just washed hair look and feel greasy given the benefits of the other products in the line  i can t say for sure this one wouldn t be good for your hair  i can only say i couldn t stand using it often enough or long enough to see whether it had any effect after a couple weeks  i threw it away  trust me  you don t want it ,0,1
1967,this works just fine and does what its meant to do  my complaint is the design  literally less then a week of using it  it began to make a metal on metal screeching noise whenever i opened it  the noise was so unsettling  i tried everything to fix it   nothing helped i finally ended up buying the official keurig model from bed bath and beyond  months later its still quiet as a mouse  ended up buying the official keurig model,0,1
3314,i m not sure what to say about this product  the box it came in was so beat up it looked like the ups guy ran over it with his truck before delivering it   in the past i will get the k cup boxes inside another box made of thicker material  this time  the box you see in the picture is the box they ship this in   i haven t tried them yet  but when you shake them the coffee inside makes a little bit of a thumping noise as if there was a marble inside  none of my other k cups do that   in fact  some in this box don t do that either   i will update this review once i taste them  box was beat to hell   ,0,1
1969,the item that i ordered was a  35 pack value bag  but the value went down considerably when what i received was only 21 in each pack   that means  for two packages  i received 28 fewer than advertised   almost another whole package and certainly another package of 21   either the listing or the price needs to change   still i rated the item as highly as i did because the ultimate customer is my dog and he loves them   so  if you order them  be sure to check the number in the bags you actually receive  hopefully they ll correct the problem by then  but treat your dog to them  without reservation  dogs can t count but i can,0,1

3365,if you like the greaseball look  such as was popular waaaaaay back when  you can achieve that by getting a jar of this super grease from clear  i got it because i have been using clear shampoo which is a very good product and i expected this to be good for my hair and scalp as well  i figured that after a clear shampoo i could just slap a dab of this clear balm and my hair would be more manageable and my scalp would benefit from the alleged  therapy   not so  this stuff is monumentally greasy  once applied it defies all removal efforts for weeks  i will addmit that my use of this grease was not aided by any type of instruction  suggestion or comments from the maker  nor was it packaged in any type of box or carton that might have some type of usage assistance printed on the sides  nope  just a simple jar of ultimate grease  it does have one attribute in its favor and that is the odor  not bad at all since i am not fool enough to use this on my hair again i tried to find a practical use for it  recently i had a new garage door installed  the hinges made some noise during opening and closing  the installer said that they would be noisy just during the break in period and that i should keep the hinges lubricated  i loaded the clear grease into my grease gun and gave the hinges a shot of this amazing lubricant  my door is much quieter now and  as an unexpected additional benefit  it smells great  useful and inexpensive   what a deal  a greaseball s delight,0,1
3306,i ve been using the vacu vin for probably about as long as they ve been making them  and still had a good one with plenty of stoppers before i bought this  concerto  model   i bought it because of the  click  the user is supposed to hear when the right amount of air has been pumped out of the wine bottle  for the obvious reason that i didn t want to keep pumping when there was no need to  the problem is that after using this model multiple times  i have yet to hear it click  so i might as well have just stayed with the older device i had   since this thing is apparently clicking away for most reviewers  my case is probably just an isolated one  or maybe in my advanced years i m just not robust enough to pump to the click  though i m skeptical that that s the problem   no click,0,1

1877,this is very good tuna  it is a  signature  product from a  big box  store  the price is steep  but the convenience of ordering by mail and thus avoiding the in store herd   hot  sweaty  lumbering  unwashed  path blocking  and feeding absent mindedly on freebie food samples   would be  under normal circumstances  worth the price however  the cans arrived with the shrink wrap cut open as if undented cans had been removed and replaced with dented cans   every can had some kind of dent  some more serious than others  and two cans were  blown  meaning the tops of the cans moved up and down easily when pressed  unsafe  the  blown  cans went straight away into the garbage do to the above  in the future  if i want this brand of tuna again  i ll have to brave the hoards and get it in store so i can inspect the cans before purchase  good tuna  dented and  blown  cans,0,1

3404,my dog likes this  probably more than his regular food   however  this is not the best choice for a healthy diet for him  in my opinion   i was actually surprised at the ingredients  you have to go down the ingredients list to item number seven to hit beef  which is the first real meat on the list  and five of the first eight are grains fillers   the peas and carrots they show on the bag fall in well behind sugar  sorbitol  salt and potassium chloride  but at least ahead of the four artificial colors added   sorbitol is both a sweetener and a laxative and not something i d have my dog on for any length of time i think if your dog is a really picky eater  but likes this food due to its flavor and different shapes  then it would be ok and better than not eating enough   however  this is a pretty low quality food compared to what else is on the market   grains and animal by product should not be the first four ingredients in your dog s diet  unless it is the only food your dog will eat day after day   i will be switching my dog back to authority lamb and rice and leave him on it until he tires of it or they change the recipe   it is only slightly more expensive than this food  but he needs less of it  less filler  on a daily basis  so it probably works out close to the same cost   it also isn t the best food on the market  but it is much better than this one with more meat and less fillers and additives  and it agrees with him  purina beneful original dog food  15 5 pound  discount dog food,0,1

3400,i purchased this after having a jar of artisana and this product is nowhere near as good   it is dry  i needed to add coconut oil to it to smooth it out  and the texture is very coarse and gritty   you really need to stir it into things to enjoy it  such as oatmeal  smoothies  etc   artisana you can eat right out of the jar  but not this brand   it still gives things the delicious coconut taste  but other brands are superior in their texture  dry and gritty,0,1

3234,i had high hopes for these pods as i am on a continual quest for a strong decaf coffee pod that will work in my senseo   i ve been through them all it seems  until i came across this one when reordering through amazon recently   unfortunately  these missed the mark considerably  they are a poor match for the senseo which tends to either pour water through them too fast or pool water in the pod around them  which results in coffee that resembles tea or colored water   don t know what to do with the three boxes i bought   maybe amazon will take them back  or i can break them open and utilize them with my espresso machine  nonetheless  i ve spent enough time trying to find a worthwhile decaf pod  i m now going to buy a coffeeduck and allow myself to have a decent cup of coffee with my senseo and a premium ground decaf of my choice and liking  not so good   ,0,1

3227,if you grew up eating these in the 1980s and so on  you re likely to notice a change in the quality during the past few years   my family and i noticed these changes the cookies that had currants in them no longer have the currants   if they do  they are so miniscule that you can t see them or taste them when you eat the cookie   when i was little  i thought they were mini chocolate chips   but they are gone now the cookies usually appear to be over baked   not necessarily dark  but too hard   they used to have a delicate  light crispness to them  with a tender butter cookie feel in your mouth   not anymore the flavor is a little different   they are not as pleasant and sublime as before   just average store cookies now we loved buying these cookies  but have since stopped purchasing them because we miss the originals  they changed somehow,0,1

3218,i was really looking forward to this salt substitute but it falls far short in my opinion  tastes like a glorified version of mrs  dash and far from salt flavor  if you want something really good try himalayan pink salt sold through amazon     it s outstanding      i purchased the one with the grinder and it could not be better  yum   real salt but good for you  it s just another form of mrs  dash,0,1

3195,while i occasionally have problems with dandruff and dry scalp  i don t typically use a anti dandruff shampoo  i also rarely use all in one shampoos in this case  unlike the other clear men s product  this shampoo was way too thick and produced too many suds   i didn t notice any conditioning benefits from the product   i generally get a softer  more manageable head of hair after using conditioner   the shampoo got my hair clean but not much more additionally  the bottle was easy to grip in the shower but it was overly tall and didn t fit easily into existing holders  too thick and sudsy for my taste,0,1
2059,i ve used the european style drip sprouters by bioset  now called the victorio vkp1013 round three tray kitchen seed sprouter  for over ten years  with good results  there was room for improvement  but overall i was content enough with the experience to lead me to expand my sprouting adventure  and now i also grow micro greens and baby greens in trays  when i decided to take the bioset on an extended trip and it cracked  silly me   i thought i d  upgrade  to this one  on the advice of one of the various sprouting websites out there  which maligned the bioset style sprouters and anyone benighted enough to rely on them  the sprout master was billed as the best sprouter in the world  a breeze to use  handy  yadda yadda yadda  the best thing since sliced  sprouted grain  bread this was not my experience  i guess it boils down to the fact that the set up is not much different than the drip style  with the exception of increased inconvenience  the sprout master requires hand rinsing the seeds and sprouts rather than the pour and drip system  this did not bother me in and of itself  however  as i enjoy the process of working with the seeds and sprouts as much as eating them  i was happy to put in more work for better results  also  with this sprouter  you have to soak your seeds first  which the european style ones get around by taking advantage of the varying surface tension of the water of unsprouted and sprouted seeds  when they are unsprouted  a bit of the water sits in the trays  allowing a mini soak  once they sprout  more of the water continues its process from tray to tray to the receptacle  if you are really concerned about too much water sitting there  one of the complaints from the sprouting site   you just give it a few quick shakes  and off goes the water  here  again  i was unperturbed  i like the process of nurturing my sprouts  nevertheless  i began to wonder whether the results would be much improved they weren t  it seems there are operational differences as well as the design distinctions  first  the holes for dripping  which i really did like at first to allow for good clean rinsing  are too large to hold alfalfa  mustard  and similar small seeds  even after soaking overnight  you lose even more as you rinse them for the first day or two  then  unless you mist the seeds  rinsing tumbles them all around  in addition to pushing some through the holes in the early phase  this means that you don t get nice vertical sprouts unless you are uber careful  were that not enough  my first batch just got rotten  moldy  and nasty  something that has never happened to me in over a decade of using the drip sprouters  so i resolved to try again  thinking that maybe i didn t pay attention to placing the lids on properly  necessary in order to allow for air circulation   but first i had to pry sprout roots out of the holes without breaking the the sprouter  the build quality is not encouraging   and to poke out the seeds that had wedged into the holes when small and begun to grow  which i d also never had to do with the drip sprouters  the second time around i got somewhat better results  but they still did not begin to compare to my standard bioset crop  even ignoring the extra effort and loss of seeds  far fewer seeds sprouted  and i m using the same mix as ever   and they were a knotted mess  i could get equally uninspiring results from a mason jar and cheesecloth perhaps this sprouter does well with larger seeds or sprouts that you do not intend to grow vertically  it may be  too  that a little perseverance and a few good new tricks for the smaller seed crops would have made this sprouter useful to me  but i did not see the point  i knew i could do better  and the 30 day deadline for returns was glowering  so i sent it back  and am now trying victorio s updated drip sprouter  the victorio vkp1014 4 tray kitchen seed sprouter  which  though still not ideal  i much prefer to the sprout master  the new model is bpa free  made of crack resistant plastic  does away with the little drain spigots of the previous version  an admitted nuisance   and comes with a lid you can use to store the sprouts in a tray in the fridge  at half the price of the sprout master  so far  my first set of sprouts  again  using the same mix  did just dandy  without loss of seeds  mold  rot  tumbled sprouts  marauding roots or seed clogged holes  plus it looks oh so pretty with the sprouts all green and alive and vertical in there   the sprout master is opaque  so you can t see the sprouts once they ve grown  nor would you necessarily want to  unless you have the patience to pamper your seeds so they grow vertically  in sum  i really wanted to like this sprouter  and feel like a  real  kitchen gardener  but i just didn t  in the end  what sets a real gardener apart is a harvest  not a name brand  not what it was cracked up to be  for me,0,1
3187,i have tried a variety of clear scalp   hair products with good results but this is the first in their product line that i don t really care for  it does a good job of moisturizing my hair without leaving a oily or waxy feeling  so it is a good conditioner but i have one problem with it  it has a very different smell to it that i don t care for  it smells like clay or play doh to me and i just don t like it  it makes my hair soft but i don t like the scent at all,0,1
2064,my best friend came over three weeks ago and i had made tabbouleh  but made with quinoa instead of bulgar  he loved it  in fact  everyone that i had try it was hooked  but then he mentioned that real tabbouleh is made with bulgar and that we should try that to see how it would work out    so he went on a quest and found this product on amazon  i have to say  if i would have known that he was purchasing a product that all the ingredients was inclusive  this product would have never been purchased  not to be offensive  but his is a product for people that are either lazy  non cooks  on the run  or that just don t care about their health  if you are going to make tabbouleh  make it with fresh ingredients so  my friend ordered it    it came in two days and when opening the two boxes    yes  it was very nicely packaged  but even at that  two packs were broken and the content was all inside the box    not a big deal  but then is when i noticed that the product he  my friend  had ordered  was an all inclusive product  i cringed  and figured i would try it and give it a shot  if you like lemons    lots of lemons  you might enjoy this product  it was so bad  that i called amazon  told them i was highly dissatisfied and i was refunded the complete purchase price this is a perfect example of a company processing ingredients together to make it easy for the consumer  but please do yourself a favor  if you are going to make and serve such a delicate dish  use fresh ingredients  this is a super food that should never be sold all inclusive  what to expect from processed foods   ,0,1

3176,boo to this   i was so happy with it when i had finally found a low carb cereal in which i could add my own sweetener to control how sweet i wanted it  and safely   with stevia or something else   even just a couple of sliced strawberries   this was the only one to fit into a reasonable daily carb allowance then they changed it to be sweeter and loaded up on more sugar and carbs   i complained to kellogg and they replied that they did a taste test and found people wanted it to be sweeter   a taste test   on people that probably had no interest in its intended purpose to be a healthier option for people that actually need to watch their diets closely   they evidently didn t test for value when it came to its health benefits  they tested purely for flavor   shouldn t this have been tested on people that were concerned with health      it s that essentially the goal demographic   the general public has tons of sugary cereals to choose from   can t we just have one you ve lost my business  kellogg  as well as many others that follow a low carb keto diet   i was once recommending this cereal to everyone that was trying to be more healthy so they didn t have to give up all the types of food they love  those on atkins  protein power  the huge following of low carbers on reddit  to name a few   now we re back to pretty much no cereal options once again  formula changed to make it less healthy,0,1

2023,as most others i compared this product to 5 hour energy shot that i occasionally take   i had been picking up free samples of 5 hour energy at some of the bike rallies i go to  one particularly grueling day after about 9  hours of  traveling and attending a recent motorcycle rally i was really dragging  my son offered me a 5 hour energy drink and within 10 minutes or so i could really feel the difference  i decided to buy some but when i saw the prices here on amazon i balked  i noticed the extra strength red rain energy shots at about half the price of the 5 hour energy shots so after reading mixed reviews i decided to take a chance on a twelve pack  sometimes at work i need a mid morning or mid afternoon pick me up that is when i usually take a half bottle of 5 hour energy  generally within 10 minutes or so i can tell a marked difference  when i took the same amount of red rain energy shot one morning  after about 10 minutes i had to think if i could tell if it was making a difference  if any  the affect was very subtle for a half bottle of the red rain  the next time i drank the whole bottle and noticed a little difference in my mid morning blah  but definately not as much effect as the 5 hour energy  if i have to take twice as much red rain  whole bottle  and not feel even the same effect as a half bottle of 5 hour energy i may as well stay with the 5 hour energy next time  for those of you that feel you got as much a boost as the 5 hour energy i say   great   red rain just didn t provide me with the  kick  that i got with the other brand so therefore i won t buy it again  disappointed,0,1

2019,i really like these snack bars to eat in the morning on the go  the only problem is the packaging is terrible  the box the bars come in is the hardest box to open  the opening flap always tears and usually tears the flap underneath it as well  even if you were to rip off the flaps completely the perforations offer no help  the troublesome packaging makes me think twice about buying this snack in the future  too bad because the bars are tasty  great snack but packaging is annoying,0,1
3300,these chips look like the real thing and they taste alright but there is simply too much maltitol in them  especially for a single serving  the other drawback is that if you are sensitive to maltitol or have blood sugar issues  these are going to upset your system  i do get a craving for chocolate chips now and then  rarely since i m low carbing it  so i m going to try and  dilute  these with wondercocoa powder or sugar free dark chocolate in a recipe and see how it turns out  too much maltitol   ,0,1

3283,okay  based on a you tube video that i found  the product is applied post shower and hair drying styling   part the hair in sections  rub one finger lighly over the product and then apply directly to the scalp only   repeat only over areas of the scalp needing treatment   minimal product is needed   one jar should last quite awhile and  on the areas i ve tested  the product does work i give this product four stars because it does work but i m deducting two stars because the packaging developers failed to communicate instructions and caused way too many people stress and damaged hair although i do hold the packaging developers accountable for the number of bad reviews  i am dumbfounded at the number of customers who used this product without doing any research as how to properly apply it a quick web search brings up a video on youtube that would have eliminated frustration and hair damage   not saying that the manufacturer should have neglected to put proper instructions on the jar or attached them somehow  honestly  what if hair loss was the result of mis application   if there is computer access available to leave a review   the same technology would have avoided the situation that caused the negative review   the negative reviews are justified because of the packaging but why risk the damage when a search engine would have prevented it   that s all i m saying  the product works but nobody knows how to use it right due to packing issues ,0,1

3282,for me  the clear product line has been a mixed bag ranging from really nice to not so nice  i received this early this morning and used it before i bathed  this product has given me a problem  there were no instructions for usage so i used this as a pre treatment  i dampened my hair and applied two quarter sized globs on my hair  i massaged it lightly on the scalp and then combed it through my shoulder length hair  i put a plastic shower cap on and gave it a half hour to absorb  right now my hair is pretty dry as well as over exposed to sun and salt water  my hair is also straight and extremely fine i showered and washed my hair  it felt smooth and soft in the shower  however as it started air drying i realized that my hair was seriously greasy  i ended washing it with a clarifying shampoo three times in total to get rid of the greasy consistency  frankly  i thought i might have to use dawn  my perennial degreaser  or tide to get my hair clean  my hair is still over moisturized but presentable at least i can t recommend this product based on my experience using it   it is quite possible that it might work better on coarser hair  but it doesn t do it for fine straight hair  i also think it would help if the manufacturer provided instructions for usage  intensely       greasy,0,1

2000,the only directions for use that came with this product  if they can be called that  which i submit they cannot   read as follows   1  cleanse 2  smooth 3  soothe 4  seal  huh i was clueless  so i called the 800 number at the bottom of the ingredients list  got connected to customer service and asked how i was supposed to go about using their product  the rep told me to massage the product into my scalp right after shampooing  while my hair was still wet  then to  pull it through  my hair with my fingers and the result would be not only a healthier scalp  but also shinier hair  what i got was a head of hair that could have easily won auditions for revivals of  grease     jersey boys  and maybe even  west side story   good thing i tried this on a day when i didn t have to be seen in public  as it took four very thorough shampooings  before there was any way i was going to be able to take my head out of the house that day  anybody here have travolta s number   cause i ve gotta nice big fat jar of stuff with only about a teaspoon s worth gone missing and it s looking for a good home  no directions  called customer service  ended up with a real mess on my head anyhow ,0,1
2004,it s hard to add to much to a review here other than to join in the choir   i picked this up because my wife loves trying new hair products  and i always try them with here   i didn t know anything about this other than the name  ultra shea intense scalp nourishing balm  which sounded pretty simple and universal   like everyone  when i got it i wasted time scouring the package for directions  surprise  there are none   and then just gave it a shot after reading several of the reviews here  it looks like this is a race specific product  of which the packaging gives no clue   maybe there are some secret code words i am missing  but i have  natural hair  as in the hair on my head is natural we have two kinds of  natural hair  in my household  and this didn t work for either of them   my wife  asian  long hair  gave up after one try and said it was way to greasy   me  white guy  short hair  was a little more persistent   i tried it on dry hair and wet hair and moist hair  but to no avail   it works pretty good as a hair gel  and is powerful enough to stick my hair straight up  i could have used it during my punk rock days to stand up my mohawk  but then there is the overpowering scent to go with it  i don t think it will replace my standard hair gel anytime soon it seems like this is more of a marketing fail than a product fail  it has a pretty specific market and use  and is not as general as the name and packaging would lead you to believe  me too,0,1
2010,in my quest to find new and exciting cereals for my morning wakeup  i stumbled across a mega box of waffle crisp at the grocery store yesterday and just had to snatch it up   i love waffles  who doesn t  and so i just had to try this   what starts off rather delicious turns to mush very quickly  so if you tend to take your time eating your breakfast  which is the case with me since i work from home and eat while i work  then this can turn off putting rather quickly   the maple flavor  which is the best part of the waffle experience  is subtle enough to not be overly sweet  but it is also subtle enough to be mistaken for something else entirely   in fact  this tasted a lot like cookie crisp at first  which is not what i was wanting   my milk was rather delicious in the end  so there is always that   i can t say that i m all that impressed really   i wanted to be  and i expected to be  but at the end of the day  or should i say  morning   i m left with some mushy mini sponges swimming in lightly flavored maple milk  post consumer waste   ,0,1
3252,i got this for my husband who s always complaining about how dry his scalp is  unfortunately  he has straight  fine hair and is caucasian  so this product wasn t exactly suited to his needs  it is very greasy  even when just a little is applied  and takes several washes to get it all out  i read some of the other reviews and there seems to be a consensus regarding how it s better suited to african american hair type and not so much for caucasian hair types  one other thing is that this product contains petrolatum  oops  wrong hair type,0,1
3251,this tea is actually quite strong compared to the other chocolate teas   i think i would like the tea if it tasted more like tea and less like pina colada   tea shouldn t taste like this   i love the other chocolate teas though they are a great buy  though not as strong d   dosen t taste like tea,0,1
2017,i wanted to try this product as some unknown critter keeps going into the mulch around my fruit trees and strews the mulch into the lawn   every few days i have to take a rake to repair   i think it is a cat as there is a feral cat in the neighborhood that likes to have romantic trysts on the fence waking me at night i applied on a sunny day as directed and within two days my mulch was disturbed   we had not had any rain although the yard does have a sprinkler system   i personally believe this product would do best in warm areas as the heat makes the included peppers more pungent  did not work for me  cat,0,1
3244,when you see  ginger   lemon beverage mix  a reasonable person expect a balanced refreshment  that is not what you get  if you like to munch on ginger in your spare time  this is a drink for you  the ginger taste is overbearing and overpowering  and the only hint of lemon i got was a sourness in the aftertaste speaking of  the aftertaste so strong  as strong as but distinct from the main taste  that i ended up throwing half my glass down the drain  i ve drank some odd things in my day  passion fruit and aloe juice  for instance   but i just couldn t tolerate this  and  just for good measure  the package was a bear to open for me on the plus side  the mix is some nice yellowish pellets  about the size of the wax ball you see on new pens sometimes  that dissolve quickly and cleanly in hot water  but when the best thing i have to say about a drink is how nicely the mix dissolves  something s not right  way too strong,0,1

3453,purina beneful has not been out for long  but it has become hugely popular   my sister just switched her dog to it this summer  because he was having some stomach issues  she thought a new dog food might be a good idea    his stomach issues quit right before she switched  though    she was feeding purina one chicken   rice dog food  4 pound bags  pack of 6   which is an excellent dog food  with meat as the first ingredient   corn is the first ingredient in beneful   corn is a filler food  and not really good for dogs  cats  ferrets  etc   yet  so many animal feeds have it  including many of the outrageously expensive science diets   and so many pets have eaten corn based food their entire lives  and lived a long long time   you could go nuts figuring out what to feed your pets    oh  and don t feed your ferrets nuts    personally  i think purina one is a far superior feed over beneful   that s what i feed my cats  purina one cat smartblend chicken and rice cat food  16 pound    oh  and my ferrets  too  purina one kitten growth   dev  7 pounds    but my sister s dog loves beneful  is doing fine on it  and she s sticking with it right now   she says her dog needed more vegetables     corn is the  1 ingredient         ,0,1

3685,baking soda is amazing stuff so  i almost bought this  in my head picturing the 4 lb box   then i saw a complaint by another reviewer about how very small the box is and realized that i was making the same mistake as that amazon reviewer   thanks  helpful stranger    i cancelled the order  the price was way  way too high for the same regular sized box available for much cheaper in the departments stores around here but  i did later buy a bunch of these little 1 lb boxes in bulk elsewhere online   a box of this does wonders for my gym locker  and a larger box would not have fit  i also like to keep a little box in the kitchen for dishes in need of hand washing that have an unpleasant odor for some reason  saved by another reviewer,0,1
1672,i loved the way this looked in the beautiful gold boxes and ribbon in a tall tower   i was a bit disappointed though when i opened it all because it seemed like nothing all that special   the foods inside were fine but they looked like they were going to be amazing by the packaging   something with a fancy name ive never heard before was chex mix and a few of the other things came in very tiny quantities   the birthday bear was by far the best part   it is adorable  wish the contents were as impressive as the packaging ,0,1

3676,i ve been using harvest brand vegetarian broth mixes for years but to get them requires a 30 45 minute round trip drive to the specialty market   feeling lazy  i ordered this off amazon   it seems pleasant enough when you dip a finger in the mix but to get water to taste like anything you have to use a ton   i get low sodium but this should be titled low flavor   it s more sweet than anything and i have to add a ton plus salt and other seasonings to make a decent broth   i won t buy this again  very disappointing,0,1
1681,at first  the soda tastes great  but then the stevia or whatever else they put in it kicks in   you are left with a very unnatural taste and feeling inside your mouth   the aftertaste is a deal breaker   i resolved to slam the last four of the sodas so i only had to deal with one final aftertaste   the aftertaste freeling of four sodas lasted for several days  even after drinking other things  eating  brushing  flossing  and waterpik ing  starts of great  then regret ,0,1
3670,i originally searched for tone s or weber canadian steak seasoning i used these brands for years as a table seasoning in lieu of salt as iam a heart patient and am limited in salt intake   these filled the bill when these items could not be found or were discontinued  this product wasmost similar in their advertising  however the taste of this productis horrible by comparison to the above mentioned superior brands   i willnot buy again or recommend  canadian steak seasoning no salt,0,1
3660,without a car of our own the small size and light weight of the incline scratcher seemed like definite features  as did the price    so we happily took one home  our pair of boisterous bengals enjoyed poking at the paper pom pom inside  and were intrigued by the scratching surface  but when they tried leaning on it to sharpen their claws it slid right out from under them or tipped over  despite being braced in a corner of the room  that was enough for sistercat   she wasn t interested in going near it again  no matter how much we coaxed or cajoled we tried weighing it down firmly  and brothercat gave it another go    at which point his claws caught in the cardboard and he ended up pulling the entire scratching pad out from the main structure  that was it for him  we ve kept it around just in case  but it s just been gathering dust   neither cat showed any interest again we ended up with an armarkat cat tree  and a scratching mat  both do a far better job of standing up to the energetic feline pair and their antics i do like the concept of the incline scratcher   it s clever  environmentally friendly and affordable   though i can see it leading to cardboard scraps all over the floor if it s actually used  it might be good for kittens or small cats   i ll probably donate it to kitten rescue or the like unfortunately  though  this product is just not up to the force a largish  active cat can apply  the upside  it s lightweight  the downside  it s lightweight   ,0,1
3655,the taste is there  i would definitely eat this again  with toasted wheat bread  some mustard and onions it makes a very filling meal  reason i am giving it two stars is because the can is absolutely horrible  filmsy engineering  once i pull up the cap it breaks immediately  luckily there was a can opener around  could of made a real mess and cut myself in the process if i am hungry and the only brand around is roland then i will take another chance at it  other than that there are so many other reliable brands out there at the supermarket  need some quality assurance ,0,1

1703,this bottle of fruit punch flavored vitamin squeeze sat in my refrigerator for a while   i usually drink filtered water and i don t typically like to add anything to it   but the vitamin squeeze product seemed like a good thing to try  not only for the flavor it adds to water but for the small array of vitamins this product adds when i finally got around to trying it  i wanted to judge it based on flavor and health benefits based on the ingredient list   for flavor  i did not really care for this product   the sucralose gives it that unmistakable artificial taste  and the first word that popped in my head when i tasted it was  fake    it tastes cloyingly sweet and artificial  like those bottles of  healthy  fruit punch you see in the juice aisle for the health benefits  i am always somewhat skeptical of any product that claims to increase  energy  yet contains no carbs or calories   and like most  energy  drinks  one of the ingredients is  natural caffeine  mixed with an assortment of b vitamins and an amino acid   in my opinion  this product might increase your energy levels temporarily  but much of that effect comes from the stimulant properties of caffeine the real test of a product like this is  would i drink it again    and the answer for me is  no    i found the taste very artificial and i don t like using sucralose containing  splenda  products    i switched to truvia natural sweetener a long time ago    i am also sensitive to caffeine  and drinking any caffeine containing product after a certain time leaves me with insomnia   personally  i would prefer skipping this product and continuing to drink plain water  taking a vitamin supplement for the extra vitamins   so overall  i do not recommend this product   the only reason i upgraded from 1 star to 2 stars is the fact that this product does contain some beneficial vitamins  unlike most ready made  highly sweetened fruit punch drinks  artificial taste  typical stimulent based energy drink,0,1
3647,the product description stated  cadbury flake  1 13 ounce units  pack of 24    i only received 22 individually wrapped units   i had expected to receive 24 individually wrap units  then wrapped in a larger cadbury bag  unfortunately i can t ship these back because they were a gift to a group of people for today so i am 2 short     the shipping package included cool packs to ensure they would not melt which is great for the summer months  the individual flake bars were all intact the wrappers are international marked with writing in lots of different languages  i ve seen similar wrappers at airports around the world   they say they were made by cadbury ireland expiration appears to be may 14th 2013the chocolate was delicious as always  didn t quite get everything,0,1

1715,i know chai is sweet   but wow on this one   i can agree with all here about the great flavors   but the sweet   i have to be careful with sugar  but i slipped on this one   sugar is the first ingredient on the list   it would be better for me if they would have put no sugar in this at all  and let me decide how sweet it needs to be   i would have used a stevia extract  a natural sweetener more attune to those with sugar sensitive constitutions   i will be sending this to a church for their  bowl blessing  parties   i think they ll enjoy it  chai yi yi    ,0,1

3690,these bars are very inexpensive for an  organic  product  i tried one box of them and was very glad i didn t buy any more   even my husband who eats anything complained that they don t have much taste as stated by others  they are small  which is probably a good thing considering the high percentage of sweeteners and various fats and oils that they contain   the only whole grain in them is the oats  which has been treated and highly processed following is a list of the ingredients  the words that seem misspelled are cut and pasted from what seems to be a photo of the actual box label ingredients list on another web site  organic toasted whole oates  organic whole oats  organic cane syrup  organic expeller pressed sunflower oil   organic brown rice syrup  organic fair trade chocolate chips  organic cane sugar  organic chocholate liquor  organic cocoa butter  organic vanilla   organic rice crisp  organic rice flour  organic cane sugar   organic palm oil  organic tapioca starch  natural vanilla flavor also   note that the last ingredient   natural vanilla flavor  is not organic and is probably not even natural since most  natural  flavors now come from a chemical factory  highly processed   high sugar   low taste,0,1

3610,this is an add on to my recent review   i do like these bars  but in the news recently there has been a lot of talk about high levels of arsenic in rice  particularly rice syrup  unfortunately  the first ingredient in these bars is just that  i emailed oskri  and while they were extremely quick in replying to my first email to them asking about their sugar ingredient as indicated in my post below  they have never replied to my inquery about the rice syrup and what  if any  testing had been done  so  until they do that  i will stop purchasing  and eating  this product i have tried almost every type of protein bar there is  normally  they have a ton of added sugar   i am a label reader     i bought my first oskri bar in a local health food store    a fiber bar  i was surprised that the ingredients didn t say  sugar   yet it had a sugar content  so  i was curious and checked with the company to see what exactly was holding it together and what the sugar was    chickory root  someone actually figured out how to make a completely natural product   i then had to find what other flavors they had  the almond and cranberries are my favorite  nothing else can compete  i am buying them by the box now  thank you  amazon   i also bought the fig bars  i made the mistake of not checking the ingredients first  though  but  was pleasantly surprised to find that the bars were 100  fig  that is unheard of  how more natural can you get   if you like fig newtons  you will love the figs    they just don t have the dough wrapper  and  they come in a mini size  which are perfect and hit the spot  great job oskri these are sooo good     but    ,0,1

1736,after trying this product  i agree with other reviews that it doesn t last 30 days   the price point is high for what you get   i prefer going to bj s or sam s club and picking up a vat of black pepper and or cayenne powder and sprinkling it around any perimeter where you don t want critters and it is cheaper to use   i feel safer   i ve used the black pepper before around the perimeter of our home to deter black ants and it works   we also use the black pepper   cayenne powder around our veggie garden to deter animals away   we reapply as needed  but it seems once they know it s there  they find somewhere else to dine   i ve also used moth balls around my flower gardens to deter cats from eliminating in them  you can use a cheaper  safer alternative,0,1

3518,the only reason i bought this product is that i had a gift card for  20 and was looking for something to get as close to  20 as i could  that i would actually use   i m a coffee lover  and instant just doesn t do it   the only thing great about this product is it is easy to take camping and make a cup of coffee fast in the cold morning   i m totally satisfied with it from that point of view   otherwise it s instant coffee and tastes like it   plus  the shipping cost was way more than the coffee was worth   but i got to use my gift card  19 98 total  and get another product that i really wanted  so i m satisfied  only good for one thing    ,0,1

3512,this product was last on the shelves of local markets for less than  4 00 per 64oz box  when i last ordered through the online vendor  other than amazon  the quality of packing was not sufficient to withstand the direct order of smaller units  4  for the 64 oz box  the product arrived with boxes leaking or the seal no longer air tight when picking up at the stores   it had leaked on the shelves  the boxes were often dented and damaged  no longer airtight and did the same when shipped to my door finally  i made a larger purchase locally of as many as 6 boxes of 64oz  however today as i opened the last box well within the freshness date  it had begun to form  skins  of yellow soy  most likely the fatty portion of the bean this has been really disconcerting since the original product  westsoy original organic unsweetened soymilk  was delivered without any additives  at an affordable price with a quality that was excellent  now  it appears that amazon has become one of the primary  if not exclusive distributors of the products  without managing the quality while the price is going out of site  the quality and packaging is not keeping up with that price this company westsoy biz and amazon for that matter  need to take a better look at their market and meet the demands for quality co measurate with price  product quality and packaging not worth exorbitant increase in price ,0,1
3510,clear scalp   hair beauty therapy ultra shea intensive scalp nourishment balm may work for some women  but for me it was like using crisco on my hair   described as being able to nourish the scalp deeply and to seal in moisture  clear scalp   hair beauty therapy ultra shea intensive scalp nourishment balm seemed to be a product that would work well for me   regular color  refreshment  and age have dried my hair so that i need a good  deep conditioning product   unfortunately  it left my hair greasy  dirty looking  and weighed down by its residue my first clue that this was not the product for me should have been the ingredient list   paraffin is the primary component   upon opening the jar  i thought that someone had filled it with beeswax that is used as furniture polish and to seal wooden kitchenware  unfortunately  what the description omitted was that clear scalp   hair beauty therapy ultra shea intensive scalp nourishment balm was  according to the label  for  relaxed and natural  hair   had there been more information provided  i would have chosen another product   nevertheless  i attempted to use it in hopes that i would get a better result than some of the other reviewers women who do use chemical relaxers or have natural hair may find this product useful   those whose hair is fine and straight like mine will probably want to avoid clear scalp   hair beauty therapy ultra shea intensive scalp nourishment balm clear scalp   hair beauty therapy ultra shea intensive scalp nourishment balm has a pleasant fragrance   i discovered it does work well as a hand cream   i found that just touching my finger tips to the surface and then rubbing my hands together  my skin was smooth and soft   i believe it may also work well to prevent hangnails and dried cuticles   for me and despite its alternative usefulness as a hand cream  clear scalp   hair beauty therapy ultra shea intensive scalp nourishment balm is a one star product   if you have relaxed or natural hair  you may rate this product more favorably  like using crisco on my hair   ,0,1
3509,as a former cincinnatian  i miss the cinti  version of chili so much   as a result  i was happy to find a canned version from the skyline brand on amazon  in fact  skyline was always my favorite  although there are several other good chili restaurants in cincinnati  including gold star and empress    however  i was disappointed to find that the can contained very little beef and a good deal of flavored water   it still had the fondly remembered aroma  but it needs a heck of a lot more substance to be more than a sad little ghost of the chili you would get in an actual skyline restaurant in good ol  zinzinnati  classroom curmudgeon,0,1

1766, how can something with sugar as the second ingredient be so incredibly bitter   said my husband after his first taste  i couldn t answer  my mouth was puckered like an old lady at a lemon eating contest hubby reached for the hazelnut creamer  poured a little in  and we both agreed it made a huge improvement i realize there are plenty of manly men out there who like their coffee black and their women strong  or something like that  but no one in our family resembles that description  however  for people who like cold black coffee  this is probably a very refreshing drink  for a generation brought up on super sweet flavored and whip cream topped coffee concoctions  i doubt this will be a hit  unless they use it as a challenge  like eating a teaspoon of cinnamon  or drinking sriracha sauce straight from the bottle  bad case of  bitter coffee face ,0,1
1775,i love mole enchaladas and black beans  so when this chili came out it sounded wonderful  unfortunately  the flavor isn t the complex blend of spices that i expect from mole  it tastes very strongly of coffee  i tried giving cans away to family and friends  and their response was the same  i m giving this two stars because i did manage to use the rest of my case by including it as an ingredient in larger pots of homemade chili  where the coffee flavor was diluted to a more pleasing subtle background note  but this chili simply isn t workable as an open and heat chili option i recommend that you hunt down a can in your local grocery store to try it before you invest in a case  or skip this alltogether in favor of other vegetarian chli options  from now on  i ll stick with worthington chili  20 ounce cans  pack of 12  for easy from a can chili   incidentally  if you can find an adventist book center  you should be able to purchase worthington products for less than sold here  though the convenience via amazon can t be beat   if you have a crock pot  i recommend this easy dump and cook recipe  1 bag morningstar griller crumbles  15 oz can whole corn  10 oz can original rotel  4 oz can green chilis  10 oz can tomato soup  undiluted   1 can black beans  1 can pinto beans  taco seasoning to taste  1 onion  diced and sauteed  optional   throw it all in your crock pot and cook on low for several hours  timing doesn t have to be precise  this is good just heated through but better cooked longer to allow the flavors to meld   better vegetarian chili out there,0,1

1792,i really wanted this to work   we have had major problems with various critters eating our garden this year   most of our plants have been stripped  nibbled to nubs  dug up  or eaten as seeds   for certain there are some rabbits  some mice  some birds  chipmunks and lizards involved here to varying degrees   this just flat didn t help  this was no more effective than sprinkling cayenne  spraying garlic or anything else we ve tried   it s a nice big bottled filled with stinky powder that doesn t do anything more than use up some money that could feed a nice snake for the garden  dog for the yard  or cat to attack visiting rodents   i ve tried way too many sprays and powders by now and am moving on to fences and hanging baskets   for a minor problem this may be worth something to someone   though i d go for cayenne over this for the neighborhood cats pooping in the yard  this won t save what the non domestics want to nibble  save the money and get a dog   or some big cats   or a snake,0,1
3534,i guess it boils down to one s taste buds or the outright need to have pasta in your diet  both i can live without thanks to cabbage  cauliflower and broccoli   all which i shred to appear like either rice or  broccoli slaw  or eat my spaghetti sauce or whatever other sauce with other ingredients without pasta   i was diagnosed type 2 diabetic four months ago and despite taking insulin i couldn t get my blood sugar under control  i made the switch to lchf and  less than a month later reduced my insulin by half and again by half and today i manage my diabetes without any insulin  pill or injection   a reviewer used the analogy of eating rubber bands and another  cartilage and both are right   i remember someone recommending me dreamfield s pasta   except it tasted pretty darn good but falsely advertised it s product  it was no different than ronzoni s smart taste which i allow myself to eat about once a month as a splurge treat   i gave up long ago thinking this sort of stuff is low carb heaven and accepted it was better to retool my recipes then to allow myself to believe i couldn t live without starch  come to find out  i can  miracle noodle   a bit overrated ,0,1

3174,ok  i am a veterinarian with a masters in nutrition if this helps my credibility  and one of my most common questions to owners when they bring in a dog with year round allergies and or ear infections is  is your dog on beneful or kibbles  n bits   if they are and i put them on a grain free diet they almost always get better  i ve even seen dogs seizure when they get switched to this   i would never let my own pets touch this stuff   i have found that other vets experience the same thing when they research the diets their patients are on   that said  if your pet doesn t have any allergies to this you may be all right   i have found that some patients get addicted to it  probably due to the processed oils and sugar that is included in the ingredient list   the commercials do well to make you think it is good stuff   i once even had a brain surgeon client feed his dog this stuff so don t feel like you should have known better   the foods i have had the best experience with is nature s recipe and wellness   i am also one of those vets that loves the raw diet if it is done correctly  can i give this no stars ,0,1
3167,the almond oil is a great light oil for cooking  and is really good when cooking fish  it has a light sweet taste  in addition it is likely to be a healthy oil  as almonds are one of the healthiest nuts  however  this particular product has a shipping cost of around 10 dollars at the time of this review  which is about the same cost as the product  this is obviously too high to be fair  the price of shipping is the same as the product,0,1

2388,my dog loved this food  he scarfed it down and wanted more  however  when i looked at the ingredients  i was disappointed  lots of soybean meal and soy flour  and corn meal  is it really so hard to make dog food that s not full of this stuff  when i buy purina  i m expecting something that is actually good for my dog as well as delicious  a definite let down  my dog loved it  but the ingredients aren t healthy ,0,1

2394,i normally feed my dog a semi premium brand called 4health which i get through tractor supply co stores and my dogs love that food  it s the usual  boring  food  all the same shape and color  little round brown balls  so when i opened this bag of chef michael s and put some in their bowl they loved it  after all this is a change  but is it a good change  like other reviewers i m not impressed with the ingredient list  for the price it seems like there are far too many fillers in the food  and the food is a bit  moist  and in my experience working in a pet store dog food with moisture can easily start to bread mold and other bacteria  i m not saying this bag had mold but it s a concern i have  my dogs did like this food  it s a nice treat for them but i think i ll stick with my current brand  sure i m paying about 25  more per bag when matching pound for pound but the food i feed them now doesn t contain the fillers  doesn t contain the coloring and doesn t have moisture built into it which creates some worry but also creates more weight so all in all it s less food when you consider it  plus in my house my dogs don t do well with moist foods  it creates a mess on the back end if you know what i mean i would pass on this  it s ok for the occasional treat or change if you want to mix it up a little bit  ensure you do so responsibly so you don t get your dogs sick   but i wouldn t make this a daily food for them  it looks pretty  but in the end not so much,0,1

2768,i tried both this   the clear scalp   hair beauty therapy ultra shea nourishing scalp   hair oil in the squirt bottle  the liquid in the squirt bottle worked far better on my hair  was far less messy   easier to apply this product seemed to feel heavier   weighted down my hair much more  giving it a  just out of the pool  look    shiny  but weighted down if you use this  use very little  although it s hard to do unless you let it warm up   liquefy a bit before using  then you might as well get the lighter  liquid  easier to control formula might be ok for an occasional very deep treatment  although mayonnaise or oils that you d eat cost less   are far less messy out of a squirt bottle  which the other product has would likely be better for people with thicker strand  very curly hair  afro american or similar   yet too heavy for my hair 1st two  2  ingredients are petro products  so not my favorite treatment  has some great ingredients  yet are further down the ingredient list  meaning there is less of them  the liquid hair oil has mineral oil as the 1st ingredient as well  but works well if you want real natural oils for your hair  i d suggest food or usp grade plant oils  such as avocado  sunflower  shea  cocoa butter  palm  oil  one of my favorites the semi solid kind seems to work best on my hair  yet everyone s hair is different and has different needs  so try different ones out until you find what works best for you    similar oils plant materials  some are hard   need to be warmed to use   add some vitamin e oil  natural is d alpha  dl alpha is made in a lab    honey can help    smells nice  as well  although i wouldn t leave it in your hair   give it a good rinse if you re looking for something to grab quick that does a great job   don t mind the mineral oil  have dry  thinner hair that breaks easy  i d get the squirt bottle instead here http   www amazon com clear scalp beauty therapy nourishing dp b007rtr9g0 ref pd sbs bt 1 it works great   is far easier to use i m going to keep this for once in a while deep treatment  but for a couple of times a week this is probably best reserved for afro american hair   even then  use sparingly  messy to use  like the clear scalp   hair beauty therapy ultra shea nourishing scalp   hair oil much better,0,1
2763,when my local asian grocer stopped carrying the small tin of japanese matcha green tea powder i d been purchasing  i searched for a comparable  price quality  alternative   amazon  as always  was my first stop  but to no avail   instead  i found this identical green tea powder from the republic of tea at whole foods market  for  17 99   wondering to myself   how did i miss this on amazon   i came back here to look it up  planning to make all subsequent purchases here   imagine my shock to find it listed for twice the price  almost  40  as what is arguably the planet s highest end grocery chain this is a great  high quality green tea powder  especially for smoothies   that said  don t fall for this price gouging   please visit your local whole foods or other health food store first  where you ll find it at half the price   if they don t stock it on the shelves  go to customer service and i m sure they ll order it for you  at no extra cost   shame on you   it s a treasure      seller   when they cease their price gouging and bring the price back in line to a reasonable retail price point  i ll change my rating to reflect the actual product  but as it stands there s no way i m going to award 5 stars and assist this seller in continuing to gouge the public  great tea  but don t buy it here  price gouging  ,0,1
2757,the clear scalp   hair beauty damage   color repair nourishing shampoo smells absolutely incredible   that s what makes it 2 stars and not lower   i have used this shampoo about 5 or 6 times and even tried different conditioners with it   however  each time  i had trouble combing the conditioner through my hair   also  my scalp itched slightly after using it   i ve used one of clear s conditioners before  and it didn t get me an itchy scalp  so there must be a different ingredient in this shampoo that my body does not like   once again  the smell of the shampoo is absolutely incredible    very clean  fresh  and great  but it doesn t make up for the tangly hair and bothered scalp  not for me,0,1
2755,it s so hard to balance price vs quality when it comes to dog food   but i ve started erring on the side of quality as of late  i feel that with good quality dog food where some type of meat is the first ingredient my dog is fuller quicker  is happier and overall healthier  which equals less trips to the vet for an upset stomach  upset stomach happened too often with my small dog  dogs do like beneful and my dog will happily eat it  the packaging resealable function is great as well  however  the poor ingredients are just not worth it to me  if you go on the beneful site  you ll see claims of  protein rich nutrition  with real beef   however  look closer at the ingredients and you ll see that they start with   ground yellow corn  chicken by product meal  corn gluten meal  whole wheat flour  animal fat  rice flour   etc  beef does not actually enter the picture until ingredient  7    where is the  protein rich  nutrition ,0,1
2416,i love  hot dogs and beans  but this product isn t so good  the wieners and beans taste much the same like the flavor was leeched from the wieners into the beans  for emergency food a better alternative would be to add vienna sausages to pork and beans  the only problem with the vienna s is they taste bitter when added to the beans but that s easily fixed by adding some brown sugar or honey  my favorite  hot dogs and beans  recipe is to cut up some real wieners  microwave them for a minute  add pork and beans  brown sugar  catsup  dehydrated onions and a dash of ground ginger then microwave that mixture  disappointed,0,1

2425,i m a huge fan of tea and drink a lot of it   this is the first time i tried higgins   burke brand and have to say that i ve never heard of it before   english breakfast tea is probably my second favorite packaged tea to drink  earl grey being my first choice   but most brands i ve tried are usually pretty similar   not so with this brand   the aroma didn t seem as rich and flavor seemed somehow  off  to me  but i couldn t quite put my finger on what i didn t like until i read one of the other reviews here on amazon and the reviewer described it as  musky    that s about as accurate a description as i can think of i like my tea strong  leaving the bag to steep the entire time i m drinking it  and do not add sweetener or cream or lemon   after trying the first cup  i knew that i d have to add something so on my second mug i added a bit of sweetener and it helped take the musky edge off  but it still wasn t what i consider a flavorful english breakfast blend if you re a fan of traditional english breakfast tea i would recommend twinings english breakfast tea  tea bags  50 count boxes  pack of 6   the republic of tea  british breakfast tea  50 count  or even tazo awake black tea  24 count tea bags  pack of 6  over the higgins   burke brand  there are better brands out there,0,1

2430,i ve become addicted to argan oil  a few drops tames any frizz my hair usually gets on a humid day  i found a 3 ounce bottle at a local discount store a year ago and have never seen the brand again  i think it s been discontinued i tried out clear scalp   hair beauty therapy s ultra shea nourishing oil thinking it would be comparable  it s really not ultra shea oil requires a tiny amount  my first time using it  there really are no directions  it simply says to massage into your hair  i used four drops  the same as i d been using for the argan oil  and that left my hair looking oily  i finally got down to two drops and find that s the perfect amount  i do put it into wet hair  you can also use it on dry hair apparently  but i massage between my hands and then into the ends of my hair first and then work it into the rest after a shower and let my hair curl however it wants the smell is a mix of coconut and almond  really pleasant  i love that aspect  but  the overall quality is just not as good as argan oil  so i m going to have to find some argan oil that s as good as the bottle i ve used up  takes very little and i wasn t impressed,0,1
2431,i have dry colored hair  i use quite a few different products for softening and shine and thought this might be a nice and very inexpensive option compared to my 10x the price typical products  i was wrong the description states  formulated with nutrium 10 moisture lock system  a rich blend of shea butter and natural oils  including vitamin e  sunflower  coconut  almond  soybean  argan  and palm  the treatment provides light  non greasy nourishment to the scalp and hair  notice the lack of mentioning the main ingredient  mineral oil  i have very sensitive skin and using anything with mineral oil causes me major breakouts  no way would i use something like that on my hair and scalp  since it would inevitably get on my face   i did want to be fair and test it though so i used a tiny tiny amount on the ends of my hair    it left my hair extremely greasy looking and feeling even with just a little drop i m considering using it as a hand and or foot moisturizer and seeing how it works for that  and once the bottle is empty i ll soak it and scrub it and then use it for my usual hair syrums since the bottle really is cute and i love how easy it is to dispense just the right amount of product  for the couple dollars it might be a good by for a skin moisturizer and the container    well    it smells ok  perfumed mineral oil  in a cute bottle ,0,1

2372,i really wanted to love this product but i couldn t  first off  it came with no directions  at the back it said  1  cleanse 2  smooth 3  soothe 4  seal does seal mean put a hairblower over it  i had no idea i have curly damaged hair which i always blow dry straight  my hair is very thin  and my scalp is normal dry  the main ingredient of this product is mineral oil  mineral oil is cheap to make  and its not that good for your hair  this product has  shea  in it  but there is more mineral oil than shea oil in this product putting it on dry hair made my hair very greasy  my hair is thinning so i found the hair product weighted down my hair  i thought maybe i was using the product wrong so i cut down the oil from my usual drops to about 1 to 2 drops and instead of dry hair  i only applied it on wet hair  this made my hair shinier  and cut down significantly on weighing it down my solution for this product was to use it on my ends only after showering  just a few drops  to have it as a  protection barrier  for when i blow dry it straight since ends are more prone to breakage for reference  my hair is type 3a  but i never leave it curly  i always blow dry it straight reading the reviews  i believe this product is intended for and works best on hairs type 3c  4a  4b  and 4c  weighted down my hair,0,1
2368,this adds vitamin c and caffeine to your water  which is great for people who are looking for that   caffeine may boost your workouts  and is the daily drug of choice for many of us  but watch out for side effects and don t over do it the deal breaker for me on this one was taste   it tastes sort of like sweet fruit punch kool aid  with a pronounced aftertaste   i strongly prefer optimum nutrition essential amino energy  fruit fusion  a powdered caffeine add on  or some of the mio products  vitamin c plus caffeine  but weird taste,0,1
2320,this is a very heavy oil product that should only be used by people that either have really dry kinky hair or really dry thick hair i brought it to the beach this week and i loved the fact for this price point i could saturate my hair  cover it and not get the drying effect i usually feel from  being at the beach all day   it is an excellent product for this type of use this product has a very inexpensive price point  4 00 vs 8 00 for organix hydrating macadamia oil which i usually use this can only be used on very thick dry hair great for beach usedo not use on scalp and lastly i agree with the many comments that say they should have instructions on how to use   that would clear up a lot of confusion bottom line    good value for your hair if you have the proper hair type update   i have used this numerous times at the beach and decided to use it to condition my hair after washing  after the beach   goodness dont put this on your hair dry or wet   it is so oily that no matter what your hair type  frizzy or afro   it will just weigh it down   after this i really wouldnt recommend this to anyone  great for the beach changed from 3 to 1 star,0,1

2350,the rating is one star because the dog liked it a lot and one star in thanks for the vine program which allows us to try products without spending good money on them my dog is 130 mastiff and he did not like or eat the beneful dog food that we reviewed a few months ago  not so with this bag  he was interested in the smell as soon as i opened the bag and ate the whole bowl when it was placed in front of him  he is not a dog who is normally interested in food  he doesn t beg at the table  shows no interest in scraps and usually has to have wet food mixed in with the dry before he will eat  his preferred diet is couches  dog beds  remotes  eyeglasses  and a 9  ratchet wrench  yet he likes this food  i wonder what the attraction is   since he usually shuns table scrap meats in spite of the fancy name  the colorful textured kibble  the grilled sirloin label  this bag is full of stuff that is not good for dogs as a daily diet  too much soy  soy products  artificial colors  etc we will be using this bag as a training treat  because he seems to like the taste  but we are still on a hunt for real  unadulterated  healthy food  nice looking junk,0,1
2351,these aren t absolutely horrid  but they re way too sweet and light for my taste  i like a heartier bar and way less sugar   if you re an adult pop tart eater  these would be a good  somewhat less embarrassing option the filling is pure pop tart  the number   ingredient of the filling is high fructose corn syrup  followed by sugar  apple powder  dextrose  glycerin  with blueberry at  6 on the list  and artificial colors and preservatives rounding out the filling ingredients   the crust is a bit more grown up than pop tarts  a bit lighter with a scattering of whole grains the only selling point i can see is the 2g of fiber and the 100 calories  but you could get twice the fiber and fewer calories from a piece of fruit or whole grain toast  yeah  i know  fruit isn t shelf stable and can t survive in your car s glove box for a year   but it your diet is mainly processed convenience foods  this is much less objectionable than some alternatives  hence the 2 stars i do find it a bit telling that both the ingredients and front label mention that it contains  blueberry  instead of  blueberries   i have a feeling that the singular use is a literal explanation eta  i was joking about the last bit  sort of     very sweet  grown up  pop tart,0,1
2353,these are generally fresh tasting out of the tin  and they keep well enough  though they mightn t be spectacular   they were a fantastic deal when i subscribed them about a year ago  but suddenly they have jumped to the point where they have nearly doubled in price   it s time to jump ship on this deal  tasty but suddenly expensive,0,1
2355,when i was younger  i used to eat the maple   brown sugar quaker oatmeal all of the time  i was torn between it and strawberries   cream as my favorites  i went a long while without eating oatmeal and i decided it was time to try this stuff again first of all  it tastes different  more bland  and more like a sweet pile of mush than any distinct maple or brown sugar flavor  although they say your taste buds die off as you get older  so perhaps that s just me my second complaint is the consistency  i have always preferred my oatmeal with milk  so that s how i prepped it  i also tend to prefer relatively pasty oatmeal so i make mine with a bit less fluid and generally let it sit for a bit and set up  i don t know if they re using different oats or what  but even using less milk and cooking it full time  my oatmeal was still a bit soupy  letting it set had little effect  so i eventually gave up and just ate it  the oats were cardboardy and chewy  rather than soft and creamy like i remember all in all  i was disappointed in the turn this oatmeal has taken  next time i ll try strawberries   cream and see if it s still awesome  what happened   ,0,1
2829,i can t believe the good reviews of this product  the cereal has a light peanut butter scent  but tastes like straight up corn  no peanut butter flavor detectable  only one other review mentions this  there are healthy cereals that taste great and there are peanut butter cereals that taste great  a hem  cap n crunch   but there is no overlap in the ven diagram to cereals  terrible ,0,1

2365,i have thin  fine hair so this is totally not for me  plus  it s really just mineral oil and a dash of things to make it smell good and sound good for your hair  for folks with hair like mine  this just weighs your hair down and makes it look greasy  not shiny   greasy  like i have not washed my hair for a week  yuck  i have a friend  however  that has thick  full hair and they like clear scalp   hair beauty therapy ultra shea nourishing scalp   hair oil  3 fluid ounce because it makes their hair seem less dry and coarse  we both love the scent  over the top love  too  fabulous scent  i d love to know the ratios of how much mineral oil and how much actual shea etc if you have thin  fine hair  i think you should avoid this product  if you have thick  coarse hair  i think you might want to mix this with something you are already happy with  if your current product doesn t have a scent to it  smells awesome  but mostly mineral oil      and scents ,0,1
2367,i don t have that much hair on my head  but my wife does   she wasn t that impressed   mineral oil is cheap  and if you watch your sales you can get all sorts of natural oils and  treatments  at whole foods and other places   so  you can make your own we ve been making our own  potions  to protect our kids  hair from lice  tea tree oil is good    if you do your homework from natural and homeopathic websites  you can make your own treatments for a variety of problems save your money and pass on this one  use mineral oil and add other natural items   you can make your own,0,1
2813,i have a fox jrt who knows what terrier mix who really enjoys puzzle toys  provided there is food in there to motivate him  i purchased both kyjen s triad and their jigsaw glider  my pooch went right for both  and my only  minor  complaint is that they re too easy forrest has mastered other treat toys  including the aikou  done in under two minutes   and nina ottosson s dog magic and tornado  with the triad  he had the  spin  and  flip  mechanisms figured out in a few minutes  keeping the flip doors open long enough to detract the treat  however  seemed to require some skill and practice  not generally a  cheater   he finally resorted to flipping the whole unit upside down  to discover that doesn t work very well either  unless he kept rolling it over and over repeatedly  he did  during the initial test drive  get the hang of flipping the flap and keeping it up long enough to get his hard fought reward  i may make mention that he has a long  narrow snout  and the patience of a saint once his tongue makes physical contact with food stuffs  a friend of mine has a young border collie karelian bear dog cross who is still figuring out all the parts to the magic  so these kyjen toys would be appropriate for him  as well as any dog just becoming familiar to puzzle toys  and learning how they work  it s also worth a mention that if you re not willing to sacrifice peace and quiet for your dog s amusement  do not purchase  nor if you have squeaky wheel neighbors living below your hard wood floors    unless they re out of town my terrier has a short attention span  in that if it s too hard  he loses interest after a while  not one for extreme challenges  nina ottosson s twister is still a  project in the works   and not one i would recommend for first timers and beginners  kyjen s triad and glider are not in this category  for the money  i m happy to add them to his collection  i just fill  em all up at once  and let the racket commence  nice  basic addition to the collection   ,0,1

2717,my nine year old 6 lb maltese had bad tartar  breath problems  inflamed gums  he has his teeth cleaned every year and in the past couple years he has had to have twelve teeth pulled  vet wanted to go to twice a year cleanings  i had think about brushing more than the 2 3 times a week i used to and find a dental bone that wasn t made in china and effective  he likes pedigree dentastix but i had not seen much improvement with him eating a couple a day  he also gained a pound  doesn t sound like alot but it is for a six pound dog  i then purchased c e t  chews  recommended by my vet  cost  10 50  my dog loved them immediately  but only chewed on one side and it was gone in less than two minutes  i did not see much in improvement after thirty days  i was worried the medium would be too big for him so i bought a second petite bag from amazon to try for one more month and again  no improvement  his breath was a little better   i bought the c e t  medium sized chews and after a month i saw a definite improvement in his tartar  gum health and breath  after using this for three months the difference is amazing  he had had his teeth cleaned five months prior and already had quite a bit of tartar buildup when i started giving him the medium chews  i leave the chew whole  i don t cut it in half  and he can hold it between his paws and i notice he chews on both sides of his mouth  i don t leave him unattended when he is chewing on it and i take it away after 30 40 minutes  i throw it away after 4 5 days  at least 50  of the chew remains but he has licked the taste off and is no longer interested  they also get gross after a period of time  it still is very cost effective over the petite dog chews  i always had trouble brushing his back teeth as his mouth is so tiny  the tartar on his back teeth is at least 60  improved  for his inflamed gums i have found cet oral hygiene rinse to have made a huge difference  after using 4 times a week for a few months his gums are now a healthy pink and not at all inflamed  it also has really helped tartar buildup and his breath  it is easy to use  he likes the flavor  i use it at night after he is done eating  i get him excited by telling him it is a treat and making it a big deal  the bottle is half gone and i have been using it for three months  i also bought the cet aqua dent water additive  my dog will only drink it if it is fresh  i tried making up a big bowl once a day for him and the two cats  they seem to prefer it fresh in cold water  measure carefully  if it is too strong none of mine will touch it  the bottle cap is terrible  you waste so much running down the sides while trying to squirt it into the measuring spoon  i put it in a different bottle   the product is good if your pets will drink it  if your dog has inflamed gums  the oral rinse works much better  while i do not recommend the small chews i recommend the other cet products  it still can t take the place of a dental cleaning but it sure helps the health of my dogs mouth  i still believe you need to have your pet s teeth checked and cleaned  note the last time he had his teeth cleaned he showed no problems eating or gave any indication as to being in pain but he had to have six teeth pulled and three had really bad cavities   i do try to brush my dogs teeth every other day now  it is not fun for either one of us but he doesn t fight me like he used too  i think his teeth and especially his gums feel better   my 6 lb dog missing half his teeth chewed it up in under 2 minutes ,0,1

2646,i had high hopes for this  despite knowing from reviews here that it contained a sugar substitute  i love hot cider  and especially caramel cider  it smelled great brewing but when i went to take a sip    ick  the artificial sugar makes this intolerable for me  people who routinely use stuff like sweet n low will probably love this  me  i m just glad i got this in a sampler rather than buying a huge box as i was tempted to do  grove square needs to offer an option that uses real sugar because i think they got it right otherwise  disappointed  wanted to really like this  smells good   ,0,1

2621,mmmmm no  the first 2 ingredients are corn meal and the notorious  chicken by product meal   this is one of those things that has a name that makes it sound good  but it s really not  we try it occasionally when we can t find our preferred foods  usually proplan  which is in the same price arena  but occasionally the fancier kinds   and it makes our dog  a 60ish lb hound mutt  poop like crazy each time  she usually goes only 1 2 times each day  but when she eats this she gets the runny poops and goes 5 times a day or more  can t be making her feel awesome i was told by a friend years ago that his vet told him that beneful is  like potato chips for dogs  and i believe it  tastes great i m sure  but not a whole lot of goodness in there  also  as other commenters have said  the suggested serving size of this is larger than for better dog food  so if you follow those rules  the savings isn t as great as you d think  there are way better options,0,1

2555,i have fine  slightly wavy hair that is prone to frizziness  especially in the very humid conditions that are prevalent in my city   in the past  i have used argan oil after showering and before blow drying to take away the frizz without weighing down my hair or making it look greasy   argan oil is quite expensive  though  so i decided to try this clear scalp hair oil as a less expensive alternative   bad decision   the clear scalp oil does have a nice  not overpowering tropical scent  and it was easy to apply to my hair   however  even a very small amount of the oil left my hair limp and greasy looking   i had to take another shower  and i had to wash my hair twice with shampoo in order to get all the oil out   this product might work for women with very coarse hair or perhaps very curly hair  but it doesn t work for me   i m thinking it might make a nice furniture oil  though  since it has that lovely scent  not a substitute for argan oil,0,1
2588,i was on amazon looking for a  natural soda   one with a sweetener that wasn t white sugar and no phosphoric acid when i saw the mexican coca cola  first off if you loved coke in the 60 s   early 70 s  you will love this coke  i know i do  but the reason i gave it 2 stars is not for the taste of the product  well that would be the reason for the taste   but whoever is buyng at this price is seriously getting ripped off     especially when you can go into your favourite target store and buy it for  1 19 to  1 25 a bottle  and there are grocery stores here in the san joaquin   sacramento valleys of california that sell it for those prices too  such as savemart  s mart  food maxx  it s not usually in the soda aisle either  all these guys make you look for it too  including target  but it s worth it in taste  and i personally think that mcdonald s burger joints also use this formulation in their taps  because it sure as heck doesn t taste the same as the coke in a carl s burger place  egads   now i m taste testing for burger joint colas      with this price  are you kidding  ,0,1

2560,terrible where to begin first a list of ingredients mineral oil  hyrogenated coconut oil  hyrogenerated styrene butadiene copolymer  palm oil  fragrance  bht  shea butter  trticum vulare  wheat germ oil  sweet almond oil  sunflower seed oil  soybean oil  argania spinosa kernal oil    last but not least aloe leaf juice there is no possible way this product is going to  provides light  non greasy nourishment to scalp   hair  yet that is exactly what is says on the bottle second the instructions for use are  hip  but vague  1  cleanse 2  smooth  3  sooth 4  seal i went online for further clarification and found nothing but a spectacular ad campaign with a beautiful model and her  amazing hair  so i decided to experiment i figured my first use would be the same way one would use v05 hair oil  a great product  by the way   i would wash my hair  forgo conditioner  rub in the oil and rinse  if this was too light then i would on my second application wash  rub in oil and leave it in i never got to the second experiment after only washing my hair  applying a dose of no more than a teaspoon  seriously a little goes a long way   and then giving my hair a rinse and patted my hair out with a towel  one and a half hours later  my hair is fairly thick   goes to the middle of my back   my hair was dry but appeared  matted   greasy to the eye as well as to the touch  i looked like i had laquered my head  i could not wash my hair fast enough  oddly upon my second hair washing my hair had achieved a pleasant level of softness  shine and a visible improvement in my split ends  but at a very gross price v05 is by far a less troublesome and superior product  i believe i ll stick with that and avoid this one and i can not recommend this product as nothing more than a great lubricant for perhaps sliding a tight ring off a swollen finger  greasy  stiff could not get it out of my hair fast enough ,0,1
2575,i first think it was very bad  but then i found the bright side  every time i think that i don t need to exercise or that i could  cheat  on my diet during the day because of the fact that this product will save me the pain  i re think about having to taste this horrible noodles and i jump to the treadmill in a second and if i have to quit ice cream or a great hamburger for life instead of having this  fish intestines  i will have no regrets  they must be served to people in jail as punishment for their acts  so i found another motivation to behave  just in case   don t think to much  if you are using tomato sauce and no salt just buy whole grain pasta and you will be fine it is only 100 200 calories you safe and not worth the taste and the smell  but keep some of this noodles in your house in case of an unwanted neighbor kid wants to stay for dinner  take video of his face and make some money in afv  so i hate the product but helped me to motivate myself to workout stop eating calories and fats just to avoid the taste of the noodles  also to love myself as fat as i am and last to fear jail for the fact that food could taste like this safe your money  if you want to waste it  buy me a nice plate of real pasta  the only miracle here is that some other reviewers liked it   it is for taste is that colors exist  will help 4 sure,0,1

2498,i often wonder how much time is invested in making dog food look like something we feel better about giving to our pets  this food looks nice  different colors   meaty  looking moist chunks and my dog loves eating it it s over  2 a pound so it should be great right but  after reading up on the food at dog food advisor dot com i would never get this food again  it can be deceiving that beef is the first ingredient  but as it is explained in the review at dog food advisor  that is the weight of the beef before drying and processing   which contains a lot of water  so after processing  it is probably a much lower percentage of ingredient  then there were other questionable ingredients including animal fat   the origin can be from a number of gross places  and a high corn meal content so  i think much of the high price comes from the processing to make it look better to us and therefore make us feel better giving it to our dogs i think i m going back to my 4 5 star kirkland dog food  looks nice  my dog likes it  not great nutrition though,0,1
2713,this is made to feed your scalp   but of course it gets all over your hair too   so the thing to keep in mind is to very lightly use this product if you do not have the need for serious moisturizing   it says it spreads easily  believe them   a lot of good things in this  if  you need the moisture  has shea butter and vitamin e  sunflower  coconut  almond  soybean oil and more   just use with care   i was a little over zealous with my application  its very greasy and probably is not for most peoples scalps  it really should have more info from the manufacturer printed on it  clear scalp   hair beauty therapy,0,1

2707,my review below is very detailed  but if you are having issues with your hair because of this shampoo your first step is to get it out of your hair   wash your hair with a moisturizing shampoo  follow with a moisturizing conditioner  and then use apple cider vinegar or another vinegar to strip this shampoo and reminents out of your hair   then do a hot oil treatment   after the hot oil treatment wash and condition again and your hair should stop shedding                              my review i don t know if this shampoo is damaging my hair  but i noticed that i can just touch my hair after using this shampoo and it sheds  my hair sheds a lot anyway so i definitely would not use a shampoo that causes it to shed even more  the shampoo smells good and is creamy from reading the other reviews  apparently you have to use the conditioner or you will mess up your hair   i would never use a shampoo that strips the hair just so you can use a special conditioner to re soften it update  i am downgrading to a one  1     i have never had a bald spot in my life   it has been 3 weeks now and my hair feels like straw  in spite of several deep conditionings at home and the salon    today  i look in the mirror and i now have a bald spot  in the front of my head  from all the breakage and shedding   it is clear this shampoo has a protein in it which is a no no for damaged hair unless you use a certain type of conditioner to bring back the softness once i discovered the bald spot  i began to panic and i went and bought the clear conditioner trying to get the dryness to leave and it still didn t leave   i am sitting here now with my regular conditioner trying to get the softness back   i am afraid it will not come back and i will have to wait for my hair to grow out   this shampoo is horrible update  2  this is all i had to do to stop my hair from falling out   i had to do a clarifier   first  i used a mixture of baking soda and water   this soften the hair immediately  but the shedding didn t stop so i slept in a plastic cap with an oil  i used mustard oil  but any oil likely will do     i woke up this morning and the hair was definitely in better condition   i then went to my refrigerator and used apple cidar vinegar  more oil  and my creme of nature shampoo and conditioner   the hair is finally back to its original condition  except for the bald spot   my beautician asked me why my hair was shedding so much  i ended up with a bald spot ,0,1

2702,when i found this on amazon  i was about to order    then i had to stop short how can i have any idea what they re offering for  12 i ve heard of buying garlic by weight  or by the individual bulb    but  packed in our medium size jar      6 inches tall    what does that mean  i ve seen 6  tumblers that hold eight ounces of water    and 6  champagne flutes holding only half that  how much does a 6  jar hold if we don t know its diameter   or even if we do  but don t like to do the math  particularly when the picture shows their lovely 6  jar only about two thirds full  yes  i know the product settles when shipped  that s why everybody else sells dry products by weight it gets stranger  the page says  net weight  8 ounces   it also says  shipping weight  7 2 ounces  i can only guess that their 6  jar includes an anti gravity feature i ll admit this is the first product i ve reviewed on amazon that i haven t actually bought  maybe i will in the future  if somebody tells me what i d be paying for  and if they update their page to include a meaningful cost per ounce  i d be glad to pull this review  exactly what are they selling ,0,1
2463,i got these in the momvoxbox from influenster i am a cookie lover however these were not my favs my toddler loved them but he will literally eat almost anything sooooo that doesn t say a whole lot  so so,0,1
2697,it is more that i can t use it  i think if companies are going to send out their products to be reviewed  they should expressly state who their target audience is in their description  i would not have picked this if i had known it was going to be for ethnic hair  my hair is very curly and frizzy at times but not coarse  i didn t even try to use it because i am too afraid to  after reading the reviews here  i am glad that i didn t try to use it  i would hate to go on vacation with greasy hair it smells delicious and it looks wonderful  it sounds wonderful     like a scalp massage  but when it is for relaxed or natural hair  i had my doubts  here is the product description that  sold  me on trying this out  category  hair carenew clear scalp   hair beauty therapyultra shea intensive scalp nourishment balm  nourishes the scalp deeply and seals in moisture for soothing for long lasting scalp dryness relief  spreads easily for quick absorption  formulated with nutrium 10 moisture lock system  a rich blend of shea butter and natural oils  including vitamin e  sunflower  coconut  almond  soybean  argan  and palm discover the right foundation for strong  beautiful hair with new clear scalp   hair beauty therapy a range of shampoos and conditioners that feed your scalp and give you stronger  more beautiful hair in just 7 days  nowhere does it say who this product was targeted for  it wasn t till i received the package when i saw it was for  relaxed and natural  hair  after reading others  reviews  i have to say that i wouldn t dare try it it is a lovely product  i just don t have the hair for it 8 3 12 it is not that i don t like it    ,0,1
2696,the product smells good and looked as if the turtle would really enjoy it  but it spoils really quick  it only took two days for it to start growing mold while in the refrigerator  for just one box turtle  it needs to come in smaller serving size packaging that would make it worthwhile  might be good if you have 20 turtles or so  spoils easily,0,1
2465,i read some of the health benefits from this tea and decided to try it  using 1 tea bag in a mrcoffe making 12 cups this stuff was sooooo bitter  i put in 2 tea spoons of honey in a 1 2 cup of tea still very bitter  the aftertaste lasted for days and so did the slightly quezy feeling  if it did me any good i haven t a clue what it was  bitter  oh yeah,0,1
2873,our little dog really likes this food  she gobbles it up  however   i can t think of a delicate way to say this  so i m just going to say it  it gave her really bad breath and toxic flatulence  it s a gas,0,1
2473,i shop on both sides of the canada u s  border for groceries  i am faithful to brands on both sides  i picked some of these up in the u s  since the shape and basic ingredients are similar to a well loved canadian dad s cookie  they just don t even compare to canada s dad s goodie rings made by kraft foods  if you are a fan of this cookie and get the opportunity to pick up a pack of dad s goodie rings in canada  you will probably love them  so so,0,1
2685,these cans are  2 29ea at winn dixie      2 29 x 12    27 48  how do they come up with  46  aside from the crazy price the stew is delicious   great stew but ridiculous price,0,1
2479,in what can only be called an act of desperation  i consumed one of these for breakfast this morning  it can best be described as  dense  and  nonpoisonous   i feel that these would make an excellent diet food  as after attempting to eat one  most people would assuredly give up on eating except for what was absolutely necessary to consume in order to maintain basic bodily functions  sadness bar,0,1
2677,i had high hopes when i purchased this produce  shipping was amazingly fast and i ve tried it a few times  i don t enjoy the taste  and since i don t sweeten my tea  it wasn t that great  and it did nothing for my sinuses  will not purchase again but i do recommend the seller  didn t work for me,0,1
2676,shipped quickly and packed well   no issues at all with the seller   i usually drink the other guys double black diamond extra bold   but this was a little cheaper   and   i m paying for that now   while it is strong  it is very bitter and has no depth of flavor   i m going back to dbd  strong yes  good   no,0,1
2675,sadie is our three year old goldendoodle   i won t say she s a picky eater  but occasionally she turns up her nose at food that s supposed to be good for her  like iams   i was tickled that she loves chef michael s    eats every bit as soon as it s in her dish   i even mixed it with some of her regular food and she managed to pick out the chef michael bits and leave the regular food but in the eight days that she s been eating this  she s had several loose stools and two accidents in the house    her first accidents in all the time she s been housebroken   sadly  this yummy food is off her menu   i m no vet but there s obviously something in chef michael s that doesn t agree with her update  we stopped giving sadie this food and there have been no more loose stools  or accidents in the house   it may not have been related to the food at all    there s no way to know without trying it again   it s too bad  because she really  really liked it  sadie loves it  but it doesn t love her,0,1
2673,i m usually a pretty big fan of quaker products and i was certainly tempted by the picture on the box   it s great that whole grain oat flour is used to make these cookies  and it s also great that each cookie comes with 4 grams of dietary fiber which is about 16  of what we each need in an ideal day   the taste however  is merely ok and that s putting a good spin on it   i was glad to see that each cookie is individually wrapped and when i unwrapped my first cookie  it certainly seemed moist and inviting   but when i bit into it  my anticipation turned to disapointment  the fiber must come from sawdust because that was my first thought   the flavor was mediocre at best  not very strong and not  unfortunately  enough to overcome the fibrous texture   i wish i could taste some of the almond flavor and a bit more chocolaty goodness instead of the bland nature of the oat flour so if you re looking for healthy snacks  there are better alternatives out there that offer all of the fiber  etc  but without the 180 calories per cookie   and if you re looking for a good tasting cookie  well  then i d avoid this product all together  suprisingly not so good,0,1
2484,you are always better off calling or emailing your local florist  if the recipient is in another town  just look for a local florist online  you will almost certainly get better quality  better service and a better price  call local florist,0,1

2663,the treat looks cute and price is inexpensive  it was on sale for  1 at my local petsmart  i gave it 1 star because my cat refuses to eat it  he just sniffs and walks away  i have been looking for a soft treat for my cat as he has sensitive gum  he loves the friskies tender hairball treats  which is more a tasty hairball treatment than a treat  i ll just have to keep looking  my cat does not eat it ,0,1
2491,the addition of lemongrass with the green tea had always made this my favorite of all green teas i have ever had  i couldn t wait to brew it and smell the amazing aroma as well as enjoy the taste  it was my comfort tea  but the tea has changed  and i can t get used to the new taste  it just does not satisfy like it did  good earth green tea lemongrass  tea bags  20 count  boxes net wt  1 3 oz  pack of 6  new is not always better,0,1
2686,this is no innocent product   my dog got one of those stuck on his throat and is now almost dying   esophageal surgery  aspiration pneumonia and other complications   and now i just hope he makes it and i can afford it   i already spent over  3 000   and all because of a treat that claims to be highly digestible and natural  my dog almost died with this,0,1
2876,i find everything i need at amazon so i always look there first  chocolate tennis balls for a tennis party  perfect  they were the size of malted milk balls  unfortunately  they arrived 3 days after the party  the caveat here is  not everything from amazon may arrive at an impressive 2 or 3 days  this shipment took 8 days from the candy cosmetic depot back east to southern california  chocolate tennis balls,0,1

2882,good news for corn syrup lovers   it contains plenty of high fructose corn syrup it is very sweet personally  i don t understand why any sweetener is added to pickled beets at all and why amazon com doesn t give more info about products they sell  i never thought that pickled beets could have high fructose corn syrup of course  you can make your own pickled beets  i usually do when i have the time it is simple take 2 pounds of beets  wash  peel  slice or julienne them place them in a glass jar  cover with boiled and chilled water  or bottled if you don t like fluoride  add 3 4 table spuns of salt  a few cloves of sliced garlic  a small piece of horseradish  bay leaf and put aside for a week or 10 days in room temperature after that  remove any scum formed on the surface of the beets  you can strained through the cheesecloth  and place them in the refrigerator you get delicious naturally sweet  pickled beets and juice without any sugar added enjoy it  sliced pickled beets,0,1
2142,i really thought about buying another brand of this  just because my neighbors little dogs always runs into my front yard and i don t mind but it sets my dogs up to barking and that is annoying  well  i used the whole canister of this across the whole front of my yard and my neighbors little papillon and chihuahua just came right on in  right across the  barrier    so  i don t know how it works to repel varmints but i certainly didn t see any result with small dogs  sorry   can t tell it did a thing,0,1
2143,yes  pop more than doubled the price of this tea after dr  mehmet oz talked about it s health benefits  but the high quality pu erh teas found elsewhere cost several times more  and for good reason   prince of peace can barely get away with calling this pu erh because it is of such low quality   if you really want to enjoy an exquisite cup of pu erh  try the higher quality loose or cake type pu erh   it s a little more work to brew properly but the benefits and superior taste are well worth the cost and your time   in a pinch  you can brew the tea leaves in a drip coffee maker   when the brewing stops  carefully lift out the coffee filter with the wet leaves  tie it closed with a piece of string and hang it over the side of the pot so the packet is in the tea   steep it for 3 to 5 minutes on the heat plate of the coffee maker as for the health benefits  i ve never experienced such dramatic results so quickly   the second day after i started drinking a better quality pu erh tea my high blood pressure was gone and so was my expensive prescription   i was absolutely amazed at the fast results and an added benefit is that it is the best tasting tea on the planet   i have never found any tea that has the natural sweetness of pu erh and the exotic  earthy taste is almost intoxicating   i expected something this healthy to taste awful or  at best  tolerable but the opposite was true   some of the other health benefits may take longer to become obvious  but even if my lowered blood pressure is the only benefit that results from drinking this tea  i will be overjoyed   if you ve never tried it  do yourself a favor and shell out the bucks for the high quality pu erh   if you are drinking it to loose weight or burn fat  try brewing a 6 cup pot using equal parts pu erh  white and green teas   they are all beneficial to your health and will help you attain your weight loss goals faster   they taste great together too but you can drink them separately if you prefer   then drink a cup or two of chickweed tea in the afternoon to help remove the toxins from your colon i wanted to give this product one star because of the low quality  but since it is pu erh and the taste is acceptable  i am giving it two stars   if you want to try the better quality pu erh  buy a package from rishi tea com or teagarden com  i like the option of buying different sized packages of tea offered by rishi tea com   i also recommend the brewing instructions video on youtube by doctor tea   try the real deal and you won t mind paying more  you get what you pay for and maybe less ,0,1
2150,the flavor is good  but they are far too salty  the texture is good  but they could be more crisp  not the best,0,1
3072,those are green peppercorns  will do the job all right  but my main complaint is  that they are not actually green  they don t even smell fresh  they were most likely stored on a light or are fairly old  would not buy them again  green peppercorn  but not fresh,0,1
2154,ah  it s the old rule that things that taste good are rarely good for you   well  they can be made healthier but the nutritional label on this one is sketchy i think it s highly misleading to say a serving size it 2 tablespoons  you couldn t do anything with 2 tablespoons of sauce except for put it atop one baby red potato   however  in just that small of serving size you are already weighing it at 7 grams saturated fat and 9 grams total fat   in those 2 tablespoons you also have 100 calories   this is without the protein and rice you might add as a consumer  tack on 230 mg of sodium in those two tiny spoonfuls and 3 grams sugar and you are likely to finish this meal wondering why you didn t have a big mac the label says it s  family size  and you d best have a big family who plans on cooking other dishes for dinner if everyone is only supposed to eat 2 tablespoons this rates a d minus on the health websites that said  until you add meat  it has no cholesterol   there is some good  unless you  of course  do plan to add meat   then you are consuming basically a big mac and fries if you eat normal portions for me that s just too much  taste isn t everything   i believe in everything in moderation  but even in moderation with two spoonfuls of sauce you just have too much saturated fat here from the oil so let s look at the ingredients  normally coconut milk is used in curry which is a good fat   instead they used palm oil  vegetable oil  bad fat  as the main ingredients and then added in the flavor of coconut as a spice ngredientsrendang paste  heat sterilized  vegetable oil  palm olein   chili  galangal  palm sugar  onion shallot  sugar pandan leaf  pandanus amaryllifolius   garlic  salt  lemon grass  soya sauce  extract of soya bean  wheat  salt  sugar  carmel color   fennel  coriander  cumin  kaffer lime leaf  cloves  turmeric  white pepper  cinnamon prima coconut premix  dehydrated  coconut milk powder  coconut milk solids  maltodextrin  sodium caseinate   maltodextrinso basically this is a big ol  packet of vegetable oil with seasonings to make it taste more like a regular curry   and a whole lotta sugar to make ya love it not my thing  9 grams  fat in 2 tablespoons   and lots of sugar  this is mostly palm oil and seasonings ,0,1
2155,the bag arrived in very good condition the one star reason i was very disappointed that the bag of cracked wheat was not the coarse kind but was like very fine flour   it is the coarse kind that gives bread the nutty texture we so love in our family   i don t think it was advertised clearly enough for me to catch the difference but it s been awhile since i ordered it so i could have forgotten  cracked wheat,0,1

2162,i ordered this staghorn fern for my brother s birthday  it arrived at his brooklyn apartment and he hung it in his bathroom  the next day he walks into his bathroom   to find a little lizard      and the next day    another lizard   he had nowhere to keep them and they  escaped   he was going to buy a little tank to keep them in  but they disappeared from their temporary housing i let the company know to do a better check of the ferns before they are sent   this was definitely not what i expected   i had a good laugh about it   but i don t think my brother did   came with an unexpected surprise ,0,1
3054,let me start by saying that i am so happy this brand is out there   good  healthy  organic meals that are great to take with you when you are traveling or as a backup at a restaurant my almost 11 month old will not eat this flavor and he eats almost anything   i am not sure if it is a texture thing as he also doesn t like hummus  lentils and chickpeas are maybe a similar texture   but he loves the peach pumpkin pie flavor as well as tolerates the black beans and corn  these are the only 3 we have tried   i would recommend not getting a whole case unless you know your baby likes it   i have to say that of the three this was my least favorite  i try everything my son eats    my personal favorite is the peach pumpkin pie though   it tastes like thanksgiving but it is very healthy   i might squeeze a few of them into a pie crust and see if anyone notices it is baby food   i guarantee they wouldn t  my won t eat this one   but loves other sprout flavors,0,1
2168,late july recently changed the recipe for their dark chocolate sandwich cookies without any direct notification on the packaging  they disappeared from the shelves in the denver area and when they reappeared  they were different  the new recipe isn t nearly as good  there s less of the intense cocoa taste that we enjoyed  they re drier  the cookie is more like a dry  less tasty cracker now  sure they re marginally healthier   a bit less fat  more whole grain and fiber  less sugar  that s fine  but the taste of the cookie has been compromised such that they re just less tasty  empty calories now at 50 calories a pop  we originally switched from newman s chocolate creme filled chocolate sandwich cookies to late july s because they were so much better  now they re not as good  we live pretty far from the denver area so we stock up occasionally  since there was no obvious notification of the recipe change on the packaging  i bought our usual supply for a couple of months  mistake  i ll be donating several boxes to the local food pantry  hopefully  someone will enjoy them  they changed the recipe  thye re not as good now ,0,1

2176,i just found out through talking with a specialist moments ago that walnuts have a high number of bacteria micro organisms on them  the highest of all nuts your body system might be able to handle them   mine can t because of current health conditions if you are interested  here s how to do a comparison check on the degree of little critter infestation on the surface of different nuts   put the type of nut you want to test in its own cup and add maybe 6  oz of water   add some  cheap hydrogen peroxide purchasable at any large scale grocery store in the usa that is used for cleaner and let sit for a 5 minutes   i used 2 tablespoons   bubbling occurs in the water as the micro organisms are killed off   eating the nuts afterwards is not recommended because this hydrogen peroxide is not food grade so has additives to stabilize the hydrogen peroxide  the test i m doing as i type this review is compromised of organic walnuts and almonds  each in their respective cup   the almond cup had a few sparse clouds of bubbles at the top   the walnut cup has a 1 4  thick white carpet of bubbly foam at the top even cleaning the walnuts with food grade hp isn t workable for me      the good news is that good sense may start selling their organic almonds on amazon com   yay      wonderful taste  great source   price for organic  shipped as promised but   ,0,1

2193,i purchased this item as a gift for a good friend along with several other hot sauces   this was the only one that i was displeased with   first off the sauce is just too hot   i know what you are going to say     but the truth is i love hot sauce  and have only come across one or two that are just too hot to enjoy   this is so far beyond hot that i feel it s abusive   it was so strong that my lips were red and swollen for several hours   that was only from an amount the size of the head of a pin all that said  it would still be worth cooking with it  if it had a good flavor  but it doesn t   the initial flavor  before the heat kicks in  is nothing more than molasses  this gives it an unpleasant cloying taste that does not go well with the off the charts fire if you need something for self defense  this would make a good choice   but i would not cook with it  too hot and very little flavor,0,1

3144,i picked this up on a whim  my thought was to uses a very small amount as a sort of snack for my dog before bed i do this with my cats  too  i give them each a very small amount of a dry cat food that is low on the nutrition scale but high on the cat  junk food scale  i had been giving my dog an oatmeal biscuit or two each night  when i saw thisi thought i would try it and give him the same sort of treat as i do the cats first of all  he loves it  he practically kisses my feet when i give it to him  it has an odd texture  in my opinion  sortof similar to a handful of raisins  not quite dry but  and duncan gobbles it up and clearly wishes for more  i have afairly spoiled dog  due to health issues  i cook for him every week  he eats cooked fish  beef or chicken with rice or pastapeas  and some supplements  so if i ever do give him dog food in any quantity at all  it is a very high quality  not so yummyas this   apparently  dog food  so i am very concerned with what is in the food he is given  i see no problem with a tablespoonor two a night for my 70lb dog  but i would not feed this as his sole diet  the nutrition value is very low  which is usually theway it is with the food dogs like best so  i really wanted to give this a higher rating since he likes it so much  but since i am writing this for dog people who aresurely interested in keeping their dogs healthy as well as happy  i had to go with two stars  now  as a treat  or an occasionalmeal  i see no problem with this  dogs enjoy junk food  too  struggled with this rating because my dog loves it ,0,1
3142,it smells good  it s made to be used in african american hair or biracial hair  it works on natural black hair an on relaxed black hair  i m natural and i only use natural oils on my hair  two of the oils in this jar are bad for your hair  scalp and it inhibits hair growth  no one should put petrolatum and mineral oil on their hair  i guess some people can use it to seal with if they don t object to the petro and min oil  it has mineral oil and other bad oils in it,0,1
3139,this product is essentially ground up pepper ingredients   it even looks like pepper  and smells somewhat like pepper   the three main  active ingredients are  1   oil of black pepper   0 48  by weight  2   piperine  comes from black pepper   0 185  by weight  3   capsaicin  0 032  by weight the other 99 3  are  other ingredients  when you open the big blue jug  please note  it is five pounds by weight  but the jug is about 3 4 full  so visually you get the impression its a bigger quantity by volume than five pounds actually is i used it around the perimeter of my home  which is regularly visited by a couple of stray cats  chipmunks  and deer   i also have a pet dog and cat   i did not expect miracles  and as with any product of this type  you need to accept that it is a deterrent  which hopefully minimizes these unwelcome visitors  nothing tends to eliminate intrusion by these animals completely while pepper odor can be an effective deterrent to ward off some animals  i find it effective sometimes and ineffective other times   some animals will deal with it and others will move on i did not find that this product made any difference at all in the amount of pests who frequent my property   i tried a couple of applications in various places   none of the chipmunks  cats  squirrels that i observed seemed to notice its presence at all   i did not spread it thin and i followed the instructions   in fact  i ended up applying it heavier than instructed  and still no noticeable difference in animal visits but  if you do want to include pepper in your deterrent approach  i do not see any reason to pay  5 or  6 a pound for this product   5 pounds amounts to 80 ounces   since the active ingredients  various forms of pepper  make up less than 3 4 of one percent of this jar  or about half an ounce  you could buy black pepper and some hot pepper powder or sauce and make your own  homemade powder for far less for deterring deer from flowers and shrubs  i use a mixture of tap water  some chili powder and one egg  left to rot in a one gallon plastic bottle   along with some liquid dish soap for adhesion   so you could possibly not use the egg  attracts some animals  even when rotten  and add a little more pepper  dish soap or baking soda   you d end up with something that would work as well as this product  more like critter pepper,0,1
3133,i really loved the mio line   tried most of the flavors  liked most of them   really loved the blueberry lemonade   was great in water  but also in mixed drinks at happy hour   unfortunately  after about 5 months of regular use  i finally noticed a correlation between fits of explosive diarrhea and mio usage i searched online  and i m not alone  it seems to affect lots of folks this way   most seem to believe it s due to the propylene glycol in it    basically the same stuff that s in anti freeze   the body can t absorb it  and it s a slick oily feeling liquid  so it triggers a very negative reaction in most   since many things in modern diets cause a similar reaction  it might go unnoticed for quite a while but when i stopped  the difference was amazing so    sorry mio   so good  but not worth the emergencies  spectacular flavor   watch for side effects,0,1

3127,as adding any oil to your hair  there was a notable effect on shine and luster  but by the end of the day my hair felt more heavy and greasy than anything else   other than having some moderate immediate benefit  there was no long term gain of better condition of may hair or scalp   i really could not notice anything different about my hair during and after use  didn t note much therapy,0,1
2196,this used to be my favorite tea  but the formula has changed   i ve heard that if you can find the tea in the original pale yellow box  that it is still the old  good tasting  formula   read through the other negative reviews and comments for more info  and notice the dates on the reviews  good and bad    it used to taste like a liquid fireball candy  now it tastes like hot water with black pepper  used to be excellent  formula changed,0,1

2116,product had good flavor but was extremely difficult to work with and cooked way too thick  it really would ve been more in my best interests to find a home made recipe   create a pie shell by scratch if i knew i would ve had this much trouble baking for my mother on mother s day  if you have tons of delicate time on your hands to slowly piece together a pie by hand then this is for you  if not    you re like me  just look a recipe up   product was    eh   ,0,1
2118,this liquid water enhancer doesn t really taste much like sweet tea to me  if you really want sweetened iced tea without calories  it d be far better  and cheaper  to make the real stuff and just add a packet of splenda  which is the sweetener in this mio product however  if you just want a quick convenient no calorie flavor added to water  and you don t really care if it tastes like real tea  this will do  i thought it was too sweet in the concentration they suggest  but if i add less  it tastes diluted  you ll have to play with it to get the concentration you like  liquid water enhancer,0,1
2119,1   i m definitely a fan of the powdered drinks and recently noticed the craze surrounding the concetrated liquid formula   bottomline  the taste is fine and i can see the benefit of being able to fine tune the taste for varying sizes of cups   h20   but  in the end i was put off by the fact that you have to keep this stuff in the fridge and depending on how you squeeze it  it s inevitable that you re going to make a mess here or there   i think it s much more versatile to utilize the powdered form  at least for me   it s ok  but i m into the powdered products,0,1
2126,i don t know why everyone always seems to buy the chocolate hazelnut  the hazelnut adds a bitter taste both during and after eating  for a truly delicious rolled wafer cookie  try the dark chocolate or the vanilla flavor  both of them have the light and crispy outer cookie with the smooth yummy filling without any bitterness to destroy your enjoyment  unless you really like hazelnut  i would not recommend this cookie  hazelnut is bitter,0,1
2128,my wife and i have been going through the different brands of xylitol gums mints products for the past 2 years   we decided to try the xlear spry stuff because it was cheaper   boy can you tell that it s cheaper   while it does the job of delivering xylitol  it fails at the part of being a  gum    it s hard  and gets harder after a few minutes   i think the longest i was able to  chew  the spry stuff was 5 minutes  then it became so hard that it was decidedly uncomfortable to chew   on top of that  after a few minutes it actually started to dry our mouths  and it has a weird  and not pleasant  taste at that point too it s bad enough that we knew within a few weeks that the price difference was well worth it   after all our testing  xyloburst seems to be the clear winner in terms of best quality for the price   it stays soft chewable for as long as you want to chew  it never drys the mouth and the aftertaste is markedly less  and takes a lot longer to appear  vastly prefer xyloburst brand,0,1
2129,well don t really join me in my shower   just virtually join me while i describe this shampoo  it s thick and rich enough that a little is all you need to use  and it stays in your palm until you smack it on your noggin and start scrubbing  i also give points for the bottle design  which is easy to grip  squeeze  and close with one hand despite being an anti dandruff shampoo  it doesn t feel harsh   nor does it have a medicinal smell  in fact  despite some reviews mentioning the perfuming ingredients  i didn t really pick up a strong scent at all as far as its ability to control dandruff and flaking  i m not particularly knocked out  perhaps it s effective if such flaking is only from dry skin  as the shampoo seems like more of a moisturizer than medication  but for that same reason  it leaves my hair feeling slightly greasy  albeit looking nice   overall not a bad shampoo  but not my first choice for actual treatment of an active dandruff problem  come join me in my shower,0,1
2131,    before they started using white sugar in all of their recipes  you can just skip to the last paragraph if you don t care to read the whole thing  let me preface  a comment under one of my recent reviews challenged my credibility and accused me of  not being discriminating enough  posting too many positive reviews in the row  while i have written many low star reviews in more distant past  recently i have deliberately focused on the products that i love  and that have truly been very useful to me over the years  however  in an effort to make my reviews more balanced  i set out to look for items that i feel merit low rating and it did not take me long to come up with all current health valley line consuming white sugar has caused numerous problems for my health and i had to  happily and willingly  give it up long time ago the founder and original owner of health valley  george mateljan  was very passionate about good quality  healthy food and had pledged  among other things  to never use any white sugar  nor artificial sugar substitutes  in his products  true to his word  all of his cookies  bars and cereal were delicious  even though a little pricey  and they were sweetened with fruit juice only that s why these amaranth  and also rice bran cookies and couple of his cereals used to be my favorite and a regular staple in my pantry  just a brief insight into the history of the company   he founded it back in 1970 and it was the first company to produce healthy prepared foods in the united states using fresh  quality organic ingredients  they introduced hundreds of convenient  delicious items that were packed with nutrition and flavor yet completely free from white flour  refined sugar  hydrogenated fats  excess salt  chemical preservatives and artificial colors that are so common in highly processed foods george participated in every aspect of the production at health valley and personally created most of recipes used  that all has changed in late 90 s  when the company got bought by heinz very shortly afterwards  an  evaporated cane juice  became prominent ingredient in all of their goods  rose under a different name is still a rose  and no matter how glorified the politically correct  cane syrup  sounds  it still is a white sugar  a complete poison to my system to my great dismay  there are so very few options these days for really tasty healthy cookies  that would be fruit juice  or xylitol  sweetened  most of the  sugar free  varieties are made with artificial substitutes like sucralose  that are even worse for human consumption than sugar itself to sum up the previous  if consuming white sugar is not of any concern to you  then these cookies  and other bars and cereals from health valley  would still be a better option than many other commercial brands  out there   thanks of the overall higher quality of ingredients for me  just because of the white sugar issue  all of their products have been off my list long ago  health valley used to be perfect brand   ,0,1
2132,bought this paste in my local grocery store because it was the only thing they had  plus i didn t know any better   was making curried butternut squash bisque for the first time   the bisque was good  but little did i know  it could have been much better because this product was so expensive    it took a whole jar to give my bisque a mild curry flavor    i looked to amazon for an alternative   found mae ploy thai red curry paste   14 ounce per jar and gave it a try   prepared the same butternut squash bisque and oh  my  goodness   what a difference  try the mae ploy     you will get a huge container for a fraction of the cost  and the taste will be better than you ever knew was possible   kept in the fridge  it keeps for a good long while   but  when you taste the wonderful flavor  you ll be looking for recipes calling for curry paste   try the yellow and the green curry too   totally different tastes  used it once  but never again,0,1

3093,i just received this product and i am very disappointed the description led me to believe that the product included its own cup and the convenience was the only reason i purchased it what i got was a box filled with little bags of noodles and little bags of powdered cheese not so easy after all  if i had wanted the basic original version i would have ordered kraft mac and cheese   as it is  i feel like i am the victim of a bait and switch routine here is the actual product description copied and pasted from the page here on the amazon site consumers in the us are turning to kraft easy mac cups for the great taste of macaroni and cheese  easy mac cups are simple to prepare   just add water and put in the microwave for a few minutes   plus they are portable with a disposable cup that makes clean up easy  easy mac cups are perfect for any need to eat now occasion  kraft easy mac cups is available in several flavors like original  triple cheese  bacon  cheesy taco  roasted garlic parmesan and alfredo please note the frequent use of the word  cups  and the inclusion of the statement  plus they are portable with a disposable cup that makes clean up easy  i can t help but feel ripped off   i would not recommend this product to anyone   it is grossly overpriced for what you get and i will never order this product again unless you want to pay top dollar for tiny little snack sized bags of mac   cheese  do not buy this product kraft easy mac original macaroni and cheese dinner 18 microwaveable single serve packs not so easy,0,1

3171,when tony roma s opened his wonderful restaurant on biscayne boulevard in miami beach  florida i was an immediate fan   i thought i had surely died and gone to heaven every time i ordered a full rack of baby back ribs   there were no  heat  or flavor choices   he only had one sauce then and it s not this one   it was the very best of the best i ve ever eaten and i enjoyed them for many years   even when he and his partner  bobby rubino split up  and rubino opened his own rib place i sampled those and knew they had shared the recipe for this scrumptious delight   the sauce they tout as original here is by far and no where near the original taste  this is a tad worse than ordinary and not worthy of the baby back ribs i purchased especially for this sauce   i even cooked the rack in two different ways   i split it in half  wrapped them in loose foil  and slow roasted them in a 250 degree oven then browned them off at the end and i marinated the other half  steamed them through and browned them off as well   roma s had an open rotating grill on which the ribs were browned off for final presentation and eating   tender   yes   the slow cooking did that but that taste   that taste i remember so well was absolutely absent from the meat   don t waste your money or ribs on this  this is not the original bbq sauce,0,1

2933,clear scalp   hair beauty seemed like a good option as i keep my hair a bit longer and it does tend to be dry at the ends and occasionally at the scalp pros   it works well on the dry ends and if it were marketed as a product this way then i d probably give it 4 stars cons   it has lots of oil content  starting with mineral oil  and arrived with no directions on how much to use  when to use  how often to use  etc when applied to the scalp in a small quantity the hair gets an oily appearance and sheen  since that area of my hair is normally fine  just dry once in a while  that appearance wasn t needed  if you have very dry hair then you might want to apply it there  i used the product twice in one week and my hair then looked greasy   cutting back to once a week and applying it to the dry hair in a small quantity worked better and it looks as though it might be just as effective if only used every 10 days  misnamed and confusing to use   2 1 2 stars,0,1

2286,during my recent visit to new orleans in june of 2012  i fell in love with etouffee  sauce on redfish   oh my goodness  delicious   i picked up a few packages of the louisiana cajun etouffee mix  for  2 00 per package  and made it at home  it was fantastic   i ordered the product on amazon from a particular seller and for the price of more than 7 dollars  was delivered one package  the product description on the website did not clarify the number of packages to be delivered for this amount   i assumed three packages for that price  i received one package and returned it to them immediately   you can purchase this product on line from the retailer for less than two dollars per package with free shipping   so  avoid purchasing this via this seller   great product however  item is delicious  price is ridiculous,0,1
2908,everything about this product is perfect  price  ease of use  portion size   everything except the taste   not as strong as other brands  which is fine  but the acidic lemony aftertaste is too much to bear   very disappointed  not so perfect tea,0,1
2291,i ordered a bright red adenium with white and on the amazon site it is called miss beauty  on the 9greenbox website the miss beauty is completely white further down the amazon page the sparkle star is shown as white  and on the 9greenbox page the sparkle star is the one with red and white  i contacted amazon about this and they sent an email to 9greenbox to get it corrected  it has not been corrected as yet i ordered a sparkle star from 9greenbox  i wonder what they will send me next new customers heed the warning  there are others who sell the adenium plants  website images incorrect,0,1
2295,for any who like this fruit  it does not require refrigeration and is a perfect size to give as a desert or a sweet snack   for those on a diet  it provides a delicious treat with low calories   however  the cost for shipping   handling is insane   however  go elsewhere to buy this excellent snack dessert  delicious but   ,0,1

2893,purchased as a gift for my wife  looked great on arrival and went down hill from there  three weeks later all gone  unless you like minature brown trees   if i took care of it i d expect that outcome  but my wife has a green thumb and really tried to save it  dead bonsai tree,0,1
2307,price seemed good service good i was pleased with the color produced in my rice but the flavor was very weak i have used penzys spanish saffron for years and pinch for pinch the penzys is far more flavorful than the mc cormick  disappointed,0,1
2311,we ordered one of these and our dog loved it   the peanut butter in the center was hard for her to get at and kept her occupied for weeks she liked them so much we ordered a bunch more   we opened our first one today and she pushed the peanut butter out one end in under 30 seconds and ate it   so we paid for about 30 seconds of fun   really too bad  variable quality,0,1
2943,it is true that the shipping costs really make this some mighty expensive product   i have a disability and sometimes like delivery on heavier items   believe it or not when i have to order from a local  nationwide office supply chain i can throw in a case of cokes and the shipping is the same as the other items   much better way if you want or need to have it delivered   otherwise   i buy smaller quantities and make a few trips to the car      shipping costs,0,1
2261,first i must say that this is not my kind of granola  i love crunchy granola  not soft  and this one is definitely soft cons  the oats had a burnt flavor that tended to overpower the cinnamon and raisin flavors  there were very few clusters pros  the price is very good for granola  typically granola costs more than  4 per bag but with subscribe   save you can get this one for under  3 per bag  not very good  but a good price,0,1

2951,recently discovered ginger beer  it s just like ginger ale  but more spicy and gingery  to my tastebuds anyways   i picked this up because it sounded like it was  spicy  and was a good price  but i found it to be too sweet  42 grams of sugar per serving      i like fever tree premium ginger beer  6 8 ounce glass bottles  pack of 24  much better  good  but      ,0,1
2204,this used to be my favorite tea  but the formula has changed   i ve heard that if you can find the tea in the original pale yellow box  that it is still the old  good tasting  formula   read through the other negative reviews and comments for more info  and notice the dates on the reviews  good and bad    it used to taste like a liquid fireball candy  now it tastes like hot water with black pepper update aug 2012  i purchased this tea from another source  referenced in another amazon review for this product  and although it did come in the newer purple packaging  the box says   with natural flavors   whereas the one i ordered from amazon says   with natural and artificial flavors    the one without the artificial flavors has the excellent taste you re looking for  used to be excellent  formula changed,0,1
2205,i love the clear scalp shampoos and conditioners  so naturally i jumped at the chance to get this   i  like others who have shared was fooled by the labeling   it s really an ethnic product  which i did not initially know   it wasn t for me   as another us reviewer noted  it might be okay as a light coat on dry ends  but i would not go beyond that   as another reviewer on amazon us noted  i will pass this along to someone i know who could use this for its indended purpose i do have the shampoos and conditioners from clear scalp and love them  especially the ultra shea smooth   the ultra shea has an especially pleasant aroma and is wonderful had i known this was really an ethnic product  i would not have chosen it   i am giving it a 1 star rating because there are no instructions and it comes with no head s up as to its intended consumers   this didn t work for me  but i m sure it will work for its intended consumers  head s up ,0,1

2991,took these camping  while convenient to lug around  i ended up using 4 packets in a cup and there was still no strength  both in flavor and caffeine   next time will just throw some dirt in the cup and swish around with water  mmmm   brown water ,0,1
2224,i bought this product hoping it would help keep my cats teeth clean and their breath fresh  i wish i had read the ingredients before i purchased it because it doesn t seem to have any enzymatic ingredients found in true  working dental treats  it also doesn t have any breath freshening ingredients  i think the only reason why they are  dental  treats is because they are crunchy and not moist treats  which is very good  these are much better than the pounce soft and chewy varieties or any soft and chewy treat that can stick to cat teeth and cause bad breath and tooth decay  another issue i have with these treats is that my cats only like this product while its very fresh  they seem to go stale really easily  like within a week  and then after that my cats don t care for it  i always close them tightly and i ve even tried putting them in a separate bag  in container  but still no luck  if your looking for a real dental treat i would crunch n  clean with dentashield  greenies brand doesn t have many beneficial dental ingredients either  but they are another pretty good one as they too contain vitamins but with a little bit of added breath freshening ingredients in them  so they are much better than these  this treat my not help teeth  but they definitely won t hurt them  also there are vitamins in these  which is pretty cool  they really are pretty decent treats  and i would probably give them 3 stars if they were just treats  however  to be marketing them as  dental   they really should have at least one dental ingredient  decent  but not very  dental  ,0,1
2226,mrs  js says i have two main requirements for shampoo  lather well  and leave my hair clean with no residue  i also always hope for a shampoo that will calm my somewhat frizzy curls into softness while this shampoo was outstanding for the lather  really does a nice job there   it did leave a perceptible residue buildup in my hair after a few shampoos   i do not use a conditioner   i also didn t notice any impact on making my hair more manageable or softer looking  sadly it has a coconut y smell  maybe that s the shea    and it does leave my skin nice and soft  i tend to use shampoo as a body wash as well   but since that s not enough i won t be running out to buy more while mr  js says  as a guy  i review from a solid position of ignorant indifference  i say this shampoo feels good and makes nice lather  on second and third day not so much squeekiness from my hair  is that a residue thing  maybe that s the  nourish  part  but it smells nice  residue kills it for me ,0,1
2235,i picked a 4 pack of q tonic up at the grocery store  not knowing it was supposed to be an  artisanal  product  frankly  i just don t think it tastes very good  i think the main issue being that the taste of agave clashes with both the quinine and with the gin  and i tried it with two different kind of gins  bulldog and hendricks   it was also quite flat  which didn t help  though that could have just been a problem with the pack i bought  at any rate  it just doesn t make as good a gin and tonic as your standard variety tonic  despite costing a good deal more  not very good,0,1
2976,well i had to try it based on the rave reviews  glad i only purchased 12 cans     i just don t like this stuff at all can t give them away fast enough     tastes like carbonated perfume to me  if you want a really delicious creme soda try hansens cherry vanilla creme  now that is a great creme soda big red  not so big with me,0,1
2198,my 3 toy dogs like just about every treat put before them except these and the other plato organic chicken treats  family doesn t like these,0,1
2975,the only great thing i can say about this product is that the tins are nice  the tea inside is about as low quality as you can get  i think there is more stems and twigs than leaves  i ended up throwing the tea away and reusing the tins if you have a relative you dont like  this may be a great gift for them  otherwise continue searching for tea  not worth the money,0,1
2965,just fyi  for those that don t prefer coconut like me  these almond and apricot bars are loaded with coconut  it is the 2nd ingredient  you can taste the apricot  as a subtle aftertaste  but other than that  it might as well not be in the bar  the coconut pieces linger in your mouth  so carry a toothbrush close by  almond and apricot  no  almond and coconut ,0,1
2964,the sugar substitute and another ingredient used in all these products is a strong laxative  its unbearable and therefore uneatable  the bars taste great and would be the best out there except you will regret it within 30 minutes  for crying out loud  everyone knows maltodextrin and maltitol is a serious diuretic  laxative  use splenda  laxative diuretic,0,1
2247,has made my daughter s very curly hair  like mine  more manageable for a time  but very drying  we both can tell that this product is not good for our hair  especially considering its high alcohol content    could be used as a decent de tangler when used sparingly update had to downgrade my reviews for this line when the skin on my arms and neck started breaking out after accumulated exposure washing my daughter s hair in the sink in addition to using other products from same line on myself that day  not the best choice for sensitive skin  found a  silver lining  when scalp became extremely dry as a result  with dandruff  raining down  to the touch  i did an internet search  i found that vinegar is an excellent conditioner  i used 1 2 vinegar water amazing results  my scalp calmed down and my hair seems to have recovered now soft to the touch instead of brittle  ok for once in awhile ,0,1
2248,i must say that i am a fan of gingersnap cookies  i love the combination of crunch and ginger  while these had a definite ginger flavor  they were very soft and that was a bit of a turnoff for me  i do like gingerbread cookies but these didn t seem sweet enough for my taste and the almonds seemed a bit out of place  not very good,0,1
2250,i love the bottle closes with a screwing motion like the average bottle of school glue to be clear  this is product is  dressed up  mineral oil  the last time i used mineral oil for my hair  the bottle got knocked over beneath my sink  so  i can appreciate a bottle of oil that closes though nicely fragrant  this is consistent with what i am seeing from other products in this line   the  junky  ingredients are listed first  being most abundant   the decent ingredients are listed last  in small quantities  so  i use this nice smelling mineral oil sparingly  if you re into using mineral oil  without additives  on your hair and are not concerned about the fragrance and the fancy packaging  straight mineral oil is much cheaper update had to downgrade my review due to allergic reaction after using multiple products from same line  this is one of the products used  although sparingly  may not be best choice for sensitive skin,0,1
2252,attractive bottle  smells nice  thick enough  like thick lotion  i can stick my finger in the bottle  get a big glop on my finger and it stays there when i hold it upside down  so i did not experience it being runny at all my main issue is a concern over the high alcohol content  cetearyl alcohol being  2 after water on ingredient list   alcohol is too drying for my thin and super curly hair  i tried it out  anyway and found that is seemed to strip out some possible oil buildup i had from using natural products  including real shea butter  update had to downgrade my reviews for this line when the skin on my arms and neck started breaking out after accumulated exposure washing my daughter s hair in the sink in addition to using other products from same line on myself that day  not the best choice for sensitive skin  found a  silver lining  when scalp became extremely dry as a result  with dandruff  raining down  to the touch  i did an internet search  i found that vinegar is an excellent conditioner  i used 1 2 vinegar water amazing results  my scalp calmed down and my hair seems to have recovered now soft to the touch instead of brittle  not best choice for sensitive skin,0,1
2957,i ve been giving my daughter gerber fruits  veggies  and meat as everyday meals since she was 6 months old  thinking that she s got enough vitamins and prebiotics  however  she developed digestive problem and chronic constipation  she almost stopped gaining weight since she was 9 months old  i took her to gi and she told me that those packed fruits are all cooked  and there are additives to keep them fresh for long period of time  i started to puree fruits and veggies using vitamix  and only use gerber fruits veggies when we are out and about  now  after half a year of probiotics and wholesome food  she s slowly getting better and opens her mouth to food now  think about this  if you puree an apple and leave it alone for 5 minutes  it ll change color due to oxidation  so  how can gerber s apple puree keep the same color for so long a time  gerber s fruits are cooked,0,1

2253,i ordered a bunch of different products in this line to make a comparison between them i think i was exposed to too much of whatever is now making me itch and break out all over  it started with my arms after washing and conditioning my daughter s hair in the sink  i had already washed and conditioned my own hair with different products from the line    i noticed red spots along my arms  small bumps and itching  my kids then saw the red rash across the front of my neck chest  which happens when i am allergic to something  for the last several years  my previous shampoos and conditioners were mostly ph balanced and all natural these clear beauty products have a  common thread  between the shampoos conditioners  despite have slightly different smells   they are most abundant in ingredients that may initially detangle  but are drying and irritating on my hair and skin with accumulated usage exposure  it is now clear that these products are not good for me to continue using  not the outcome i had hoped  but found a  silver lining  when scalp became extremely dry as a result  with dandruff  raining down  to the touch  i did an internet search  i found that vinegar is an excellent conditioner  i used 1 2 vinegar water amazing results  my scalp calmed down and my hair seems to have recovered now soft to the touch instead of brittle  not best choice for me,0,1
2254,the number one ingredient    literally    is high fructose corn syrup   and that really sucks because this is otherwise great sauce   it taste great and it easy to cook with  and everyone loves it but i just will no longer consume products with hfcs   i m begging sweet baby ray s to sell a version that is hfcs free kraft s bull s eye brand contains no hfcs and this is a point of pride for them   sweet baby rays can do the same   please great flavor  but,0,1

3756,this rice vinegar is absolutely the best salad dressing just as is    low in calories and delicious  i also puree raspberries  either fresh or frozen  and add to the vinegar  best to strain out the larger seeds  and it makes the most delightful raspberry vinaigrette ever  i ve even tried it with fresh strawberries  no straining needed  which is a completely different taste but equally delicious the low rating is not for the product  but rather for the price     11 99 for a 12 oz  bottle when i can  and do  buy the identical product for  4 09 at safeway  less than a mile from me  for anyone who is completely unable to locate it i d say   get it even at this price   but in my case  i d be a total fool  omg    the price   ,0,1
3765,my older dog loved this dog food  maybe because it is soft and easy to chew  my  puppy  scarfed it down  but she had bad runs afterward  though to be fair  i have heard that anytime you switch up your dog s food that can happen  i researched this dog food at dog food advisor  they analyzed the ingredients in chef michael s  concluding that it uses soybean meal  soy protein concentrate and corn gluten meal to boost the protein content  and that it likely only has a modest amount of meat  they do not recommend it  based on my experience  that is good advice  i would not use it,0,1
1022,of course when i buy anything  i want it to be useful  when i first started drinking this tea  i did notice an increase of maybe an oz or two per day  i was happy with that  so i started drinking 2 3 cups a day  i think the taste is fine   i didn t add sugar  honey  or anything  and i didn t find it nasty at all but then my production started to slow down a bit  which i figured was a normal side effect of pumping 3x a day rather than nursing  then i forgot to drink the tea and i actually got more milk than when i was drinking it  when drinking the tea  my average was about 13oz per day  and for the past 4 days i haven t been drinking it  i ve gotten 18  15  14  and 16oz  on a side note  i love the bai drinks  and i swear they increase my pumping output http   www amazon com bai 5 calorie fruit variety 12 count dp b0088mxs6u ref sr 1 10 s grocery ie utf8 qid 1339675640 sr 1 10 i do have some teabags left  so maybe i ll take a break from it and then start drinking it again in a few weeks in hopes that it works for a short term boost  i wish i could say it worked,0,1
1027,i love mochi   love  love love it   i ve never had brown rice mochi  but i thought it would be fun to try it   i couldn t finish the pack because the brown rice flavor was so different from the white rice mochi that i love   and when i cooked it up  it was a bit chewy  but if i cooked it longer  it became very hard and difficult to bite   i wish amazon had white rice mochi available because it is a long drive to our nearest asian store  the brown rice flavor is very strong,0,1
4525,i m sure this item would be amazing if it arrives nice and cold   by the time we got it  it was hot and runny and smelled really funny  but had an ice pack  that was also hot  in the box with it  indicating that at some point it was cold   we have to send it back  a waste of our time  came hot and separated,0,1
1029,lol i bought two jars of this stuff  and i cant tell you if its any good becauseit was like cement  i thought this might be a good shortcut  but the ingredientswere literally frozen solid in the jar  i m still laughing at my feeble attemptsto extricate this  roux  from its glass housing this price is hilarious  its oil and flour fer chrisakes  learn how to make yourown roux  its easy  and not as daunting a task as it may seem  this stuff    i msurprised they re still in business  1 lonely crawdad uh no    no no no ,0,1
4523,well  we gave it a shot    reveiwed after 4 out of 5 in our household wasn t pleased  the concept was a good one   add some chocolatey goodness to a special k cereal   however  it failed   out of our house  only the 6 year old liked it   why   because it was literally like sticking little chocolate candy bars on your cereal in the morning   now  who doesn t like their regular chocolate cereal  we all do  we love coco krispies and such   however  this was not the same   there were mini chocolate bars in a  healthy  tasting cereal   it just doesn t quite mix   then you add milk on top of those chocolate bars and it was just hard to eat   my husband other children didn t want any more  and he had bought 4 boxes   it was too much for the morning time   maybe if i bag this up and stick it in someones lunch box they will see it as a wonderful treat in the afternoon  and since no one here will eat it for breakfast  i may just have to do that  we are big fans of most of the special k cereals  the yogurt clusters is our fav and a staple item in our house    this won t stop us from trying more  just not gonna add any chocolate candy bars to our cereal again anytime soon  hate to complain    but     ,0,1
1030,i recently purchased this cereal at our commissary due to the fact that my family has always loved quaker oatmeal squares  crunchy oatmeal cereal with a hint of brown sugar  14 5 ounce  pack of 4   but  unfortunately  it was unanimous that none of us liked the quaker honey nut squares in my opinion  it didn t taste at all similar to other honey nut cereals like cheerios or chex  which we love and currently have on hand  because the quaker squares left an aftertaste that was a bit too artificial   i was left feeling as though i were trying to identify an unknown ingredient  instead of enjoying a familiar and well loved flavor   while most cereals don t last long in our pantry  this one has not been touched since we first tried it  not our favorite cereal,0,1
1035,i will echo other reviewers in asking why advertise a product as  ultra shea  when the first ingredient is mineral oil and shea comes several ingredients after i tried it  but as another reviewer said  i didn t know quite what to do with it  there weren t instructions  i read a bit but geez  i don t have time to research this item  it only made my hair limp  and it was hard to wash out  surely that would dry my scalp more than at baseline all in all  i distrust products that advertise  shea  but contain primarily mineral oil and my mother s method for keeping her girls  locks strong and shiny still works for me  apply warm olive oil to scalp and wrap in a towel for a few hours   ultra shea    mineral oil,0,1
4513,this is just ok   the good news is that it s cheap   but a few days ago i drank a really high quality  and really expensive  organic coffee and there was absolutely no comparison   if you put lots of sugar or flavored creamer in your coffee  this might be fine   but if you drink your coffee with little cream or sugar  get a higher quality coffee   if you french press your coffee and love the ritual of making coffee  spend the money for better and fresher beans  not that good,0,1
4506,i received this as a gift  bought mostly for the packaging  i suppose  there is no mention of the type of tea anywhere on the box other than  afternoon tea     usually  tea is identified by type  orange pekoe  ceylon black tea  etc    i even went to the company website to find info on the tea  but only found pictures of the assortment of  keep calm and carry on  and  the queen s diamond jubilee  products they carry  with no descriptions available the bags were cheap and had no string  i made myself a cup of tea  and found it to be pretty bitter  save yourself the trouble of throwing this out  if you like the theme  buy a poster  tshirt  or something useful with your money  because for any regular tea drinker  this stuff is no good  poor quality tea,0,1
1047,i love peanut butter and at 200 calories a serving it just doesn t fit into a healthy diet  especially when you re trying to lose weight  i m a nurse and i work with patients who have kidney failure and they have to limit their peanut intake due to the high potassium  so i thought this would be a good peanut butter substitute for me and the patients  i did not buy this through amazon  i came across it by accident at wal mart  it was only  3  i was so excited  couldn t wait to get home to try it  it was the first thing i opened when i got home  it smelled like peanut butter  looked like peanut butter  tasted like rotten peanut butter  what did i expect for 0 calories  0 fat  and  3  i got my mom to taste it and she just gagged  i gave it 1 star because you have to rate it  rotten peanut butter,0,1
4498,esther loved them  but they re way too big for all but the largest of dogs   breaking these at any point in the stick will lead to a mess   it s like a pepperoni skin on the outside  but like dried fish pulp on the inside   so  cutting or breaking will lead to dried fish powder in one hand and the outside of the treat in the other   again  esther loved them  but it s a one size serving   period  each stick is one serving,0,1

1055,it s canned vegetable chili  if you re hungry  eat it  it wasn t worth going out of my way to get it  it has a burnt flavor to it that is sort of unappealing  and is the only note that really stands out in what is a rather bland chili  i was really disappointed  since other flavors of stagg chili are surprisingly good  my favorite is the steakhouse chili which is generally available from costco  a little on the spicy side with nice chunks of meat and a very satisfying chili overall  that isn t the case with the vegetable chili  acceptable  not great  stagg has better stuff,0,1
1056,while the chocolates from chocolove may be tasty  their treatment of folks they do business with is anything but  i shop and support small business because i believe them to be responsible to other small businesses they work with  when the management of chocolove refused to pay for work done for them by friends of mine  also in boulder   i can no longer buy their chocolate  there are many other small chocolate companies around and from now on my money will go to folks who do the right thing  no love from chocolove,0,1

1013,all baking soda is aluminum free  this is an unnecessary marketing ploy to get you to buy their product  buy this because it is naturally mined and is cruelty free  but do not be duped into thinking that good ole   59 arm hammer has aluminum in it  btw the chemical process used to make a h is almost exactly what occurs in nature  just faster but not cheaper  it costs no more to mine sodium bicarbonate than it does to manufacture  so yes you are paying for a name  all baking soda is aluminum free,0,1

4591,fresh ginger is spicy and hot  clean your sinuses out hot  in all my years of consuming grated ginger  powdered ginger  ginger ale  ginger beer  candied ginger and a favorite when i have a writing project due  chocolate dipped ginger    none of it has ever tasted bitter  just hot and spicy  a tiny bit citrusy  but clean and mouth tingling not this  it is a powder in a foil packet  i boiled fresh filtered water in a clean kettle and poured it into a clean mug  i could taste the ginger and the lemon flavor    then a very bitter aftertaste  old  gone around the bend  wheat paste flavor  if i was sick with a very bad cold it would serve the purpose to clean my head out    but if you have access to a fridge at all   get a jar of grated ginger and a bottle of lemon juice and mix your own  a teaspoon of honey  teaspoon bottled grated ginger and teaspoon lemon juice with 8 oz  boiling water and you ll feel just like new  or pour boiling water over a few slices of fresh ginger and a fresh squeezed lemon wedge and let it seep 5 minutes    but i have trouble with fresh lemons shriveling in the crisper drawer before i use them this powder would be good to put in your carry on luggage to clear your head on a long trip  but i think i actually prefer     trade secret here     lemon flavored gatorade made with hot water  i think will actually prevent a cold if you drink two cups the minute your throat gets itchy oh  ginger is also good for digestion  again   i d prefer a spoon of fresh grated in a tub of yogurt to this powder   but this powder would help if you were traveling good luck  may you never need to know what hot gatorade tastes like  bitter aftertaste   but ok for emergencies when traveling ,0,1
4589,i have been drinking lipton s tea since i was a child but as an adult i have expanded my horizons and have been drinking many other brands   i m not sure if this fact has influenced my palate or not but i found this tea unpalatable   first of all i love the idea of the pyramid   teas that have this shape of tea bag always release their essence much faster and more fully   so  i really enjoy the shape because of this function and the shape is also esthetically pleasing the color of the tea in the cup is beautiful   it is a rich purple color and the aroma of the tea is quite nice   you can smell the fruit and that hint of vanilla   however  i had about 3 or 4 swallows and that was enough for me   i found the tea harsh  astringent  and really on the sour side   if you have ever gotten berries that are sour  just not ripe enough   that is the taste of this tea   for that reason i just could not drink it   it is a great idea but when i have tea i am looking for something mellow and smooth   while i do love my full caffeine teas  i often drink tazo chi   i do like a nice caffeine free herbal especially at night   one of my favorites is twinnings honeybush  mandarin  and orange   now that is one smooth and flavorful herbal tea i really like the idea of mixing blackberry with vanilla but this tea just do not sit well on my palate  astringent and sour,0,1

1153,has a strange  chemically  taste that is really not identifiable as any sort of real fruit   the instructions say to squeeze once per 8 oz  but  i can squeeze harder or softer and a different amount will come out so it is hard to know how much you are getting   the product label design seems like it might be for kids with the bright colors  playful fonts  fruity flavors  and product name   what is  natural caffeine  anyway   does that mean it is safe for anyone   it needs to be refrigerated after opening   you can t take it around with you and add it to water you might get from a fountain or someplace   the appealing part of these water  enhancers  is that you can usually take them with you to use if you are out and about or camping backpacking  for adults or overstimulated kids ,0,1

4360,i bought these because i m a sucker for low calorie carbs  i just loves my rice  noodles  pasta  etc and thought these would be a great substitute   these are a no calorie substitute  but like substituting tofu for meat  the taste is in the myriad of ingredients you cook them with  they have no taste on their own and a rather obnoxiously slimy texture  the fishy smell you get when you open a package quickly dissipates with rinsing in cold water  they firm up a little with a quick parboil  but on their own they are blah  i have stir fried them and boiled them for soup with veggies  garlic  sauces  you name it  they aren t worth the effort  i will continue to stir fry and boil veggies  but i probably won t bother with these  noodles  again  a tofurkey will never be a turkey and these will never satisfy a noodle craving  different  not unpleasent  but not a treat either,0,1

4327,this matcha smells like hawaii in tea form   i ve only been there once and have missed it ever since   i m sitting here in 60 degree weather drinking matcha that will take me to a warmer place my first impression of this matcha was heaven   i opened up the pouch  preparing it for the tin that will keep in the yummy goodness   the small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room   enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in   i could not wait to dig in to this matcha   if i had a piece of pineapple in the fridge i would have paired this matcha with it   i think that next time i will try preparing this iced and be sure to have some pineapple on hand i always make sure to warm up my bowl and chasen under a bit under water  sitting in the bowl   my matcha does not cool down as fast when warming the bowl   all items ready   bowl  chasen  matcha  water and my sifter   i didn t forget it this time   i think i might need to get a matcha preparation bag so that all my tools are handy   i tend to get excited and forget a key item first i mixed 2 oz of water with 1 perfect teaspoon of matcha  once that was properly mixed i added a teeny bit of sugar and 5 oz of water   i added a bit less water this time as i wanted the matcha to be thicker the smell of this matcha once mixed with water takes on different notes   almost a chemical smell   i did get notes of coconut and a touch of pineapple but it s almost a fake smell now like an airfreshener   i m surprised that the smell would change from the powdered form to when water was added   the quality of the matcha is very good  i think it s the flavoring that is throwing it off i m just so sad that this flavor will not make my keep cupboard   my plan for the rest of pina colada is to mix it first as a latte  then try it over ice   i might try cold brewing it in the fridge  but i m not sure you can do that with matcha   if all else fails  i will add it to my health food drink which is a vanilla base   i m hoping that maybe it ll be perfect one of these ways so i can add it to the keep cupboard to try pina colada matcha from red leaf tea visit here       pina colada best cold,0,1

4379,i really liked how my hair looked at first when i tried this shampoo but by day 3 and 4 i started developing itchy bumps on my scalp   i also realized that this product was leaving a film on my hair   i had been using sulfate free shampoos for the last few years but i broke down and bought this because of all the great reviews   this shampoo is not for everyone   if you re at all sensitive to chemicals  stay away   i went back to an awesome shampoo that i stick with   every time i try something new  nothing treats my hair and scalp the way henna hut shampoos do   i ve tried them all and i like their neem shampoo the best   i don t work for them  i m just a customer who appreciates them more and more every time i try other products  itchy bumps on scalp and shedding,0,1

4442,one of the reviewers claimed that the flavor of the ginger exploded in mouth    do not count on it  i am frustrated over not being able to find old fashioned gingersnap cookies that are hard  flavorful  made with molasses and are low in calories  the cookie makers left the market  they have robbed me of favorite memories of my father  he would take us  the family  for ride in the country  stop at country store  usa  and buy local cheddar cheese and gingersnaps and make a gingersnap cheese sandwich for me  the stores no longer carry a comparable gingersnap since a japanese company bought stouffers  for example   and then voila  nothing to be found anymore  i do love the buttery walker s shortbread style cookies and gift them to my family and friends during holidays   they all love them  this walkers cookie biscuit is nothing to brag about and definitely should not be recommended to people as a good example of a walker s cookie  it is most similar to the stale taste familiar to americans when tasting a pecan sandie cookie  unlike a good gingersnap  this cookie has saturated fat and is made with canola palm oils  if i am going off diet   let me have butter  please  not gingersnap replacement  more like pecan sandies,0,1

4851,out of all the artisan blends this is the nastiest one  i am not sure the term flavor applies  unless you dunk it in something  it is not satisfying  and it is a bit on the spicy side because of the garlic  i have tried them all  being a lime tostito fan i have discovered the three cheese artisan blend to be a substitute  yeah i know you are thinking lime to cheese  well the blend included not only cheese  but garlic  oregeno  red pepper  and jalepeno amongst other spices  it has just that right wang to it and the flavor is li e a super dorito  and of course the southwestern blend is also a great choice  but the flame factor increase on this one  not too hot  but as a non spicy person i had to put them away  these are nasty unless you cover them in dip,0,1

773,i bought this product due to all the good reviews   i bbq using a weber smokey mountain often   i usually make my own rubs   i thought this might be a good product to keep on hand in case i didn t feel like making a rub most good bbq rubs have a base of salt and brown sugar   this rub does not contain any sugar   it is however very heavy on the salt   i am used to using a large amount of rub when bbq to get a nice bark   i made some ribs using this rub and they were so salty they were almost inedible   i tasted the rub before hand and cut it with some brown sugar but clearly not enough i have used this rub on other foods and had better results   a little is very delicious on french fries or corn on the cob where i use this in place of salt if you intend on using this rub heavily for low and slow cooking plan on cutting it heavily with brown sugar   i prefer a salty spicy rub over an overly sweet rub but this is too much on its own   i just wish they used more of the other ingrediantes and less salt as the spice is very tasty if you plan on using this to spice up other foods in place of salt you may be very happy with this  beware of the good reviews this is a very salty rub,0,1

820,i was doing the 5 6 meal a day thing and trying to get some lean protein in between lectures until i could get some lunch  i work out and eat pretty healthy but was trying to lean up some more but as a college student don t always have the time and resources to cook a bunch of chicken breasts  overall  these are pretty bad  they have low sugar  and are just about the cheapest protein bars you can get  but i m 175lbs and these just don t really satisfy any hunger  and in fact only whet my appetite and make me hungry for some real food  i think the cheap price is just not worth the bad taste  and hunger they don t fill   if you re looking for quick convenient good tasting protein that gives you a little sometime to go on  i would go for some protein powder like syntha 6 or something  or at least get a little more expensive  slightly more sugary but more filling and better tasting bar like builder bars  these can be a last resort if you re just looking to stash them around here and there in case you find yourself without something to eat but you can definitely do better  if you re going to go against my advice  i would recommend getting the peanut butter instead of the chocolate  because cheap  fake  crappy peanut butter still tastes better than cheap fake crappy chocolate  and i ve had both  the chocolate is much worse  also  pair it up with an apple or banana or something to help fill you up a little more and have at least something with some nutritional value in there  nothing special  gets the job done,0,1

718,save yourself  10 and make this at home  you can make your own syrup by combining two parts  i e  2 cups  table sugar to one part  i e  1 cup  fresh water and boiling in a pot on the stove for a couple minutes  this will keep in the fridge forever  if it crystallizes just reheat to dissolve  any higher sugar to water ratio will likely crystallize too easily  and less will dilute your drinks recipes  save yourself some money,0,1

4899,the younger members of dream factory have taken a liking to mozzarella cheese sticks   we don t frequent restaurants often   so we tried these here tgi  fridays sticks what a grand disappointment   a disappointment at many levels a   chinzy on the cheese   mostly breading b   after numerous attempts the sticks always leak  and your left with a half empty shell in a cheese glue pool c   in order to crisp up the breading crust you have to keep em in long enough  but then that allows for the cheese to leak out   so it s either a under crisped stick or a half empty one d   the overall yum yum taste just isn t there the king of mozzarella cheese sticks is at the fast food joint  sonic    but they don t cater to the make it at home crowd  disappointing product,0,1

738,my dog is a 62lb english bulldog german shepherd mix that repeatedly suffers from allergies  especially food allergies  he can also be a bit of a picky eater when it comes to his food so finding the right mix can often be difficult  while he loves just about any treat  i always have reservations about trying new food  unfortunately  a large majority of popular dog foods today are filled with terrible ingredients not to mention carrying a high price tag  i m always willing to try a new food so here are my thoughts on chef michael s grilled sirloin dry dog food pros  dog loved it and gobbled it up   some moist and tender food chunks along with the kibble cons  filled with tons of poor ingredients for your dog such as soy  chicken by product  wheat  corn  artificial preservatives  flavors or colors  artificial colors  seriously  do you really think the dog cares what color the food is when they eat it  who are we trying to appeal to here  the dog or the person   expensive for a 4 5lb bag my dog really enjoyed chef michael s grilled sirloin dry dog food   however don t we all enjoy food that s bad for us  unfortunately  that s exactly what this dog food is  bad for your dog  someone said in a previous review if my dog was reviewing this food it would get 5 stars and my dog would agree with that  lucky for him i know what s good for his health and chef michael s grilled sirloin dry dog food isn t it  with so many questionable and downright poor ingredients it s hard to really recommend this food for your dog  i definitely wouldn t purchase it again  our current food is nature s domain turkey meal and sweet potato which is sold at cost co  it contains no potentially harmful ingredients  settles very well with my dog and is only  30 for a 25lb bag  if you re looking for a good healthy food  i recommend nature s domain brand or if you want to better educate yourself on what s actually in your current dog food i suggest visiting dogfoodadvisor com  it s a great site that lists nearly all dog foods  breaks every ingredient and its properties down and gives a final overall rating on the food s quality  dog loved the taste but i disliked the ingredients,0,1

825,i bought this because i had some at a hotel and thought they were yummy   i have made these by the directions on the can  and have found them well    not soo good   they just don t taste the same as the hotel ones do  and they frankly are really just not that good   i has signed up for recurring deliveries of them  but i will cancel that soon  and will give away the remaining 5 cans i bought   the best kind i have ever made or found thusfar has been maple grove farms waffle mix  but the local store i used to get them at no longer carries them   i am still hunting for good waffle mix  and just haven t found it in this product erik not the best tasting,0,1

744,this is an edit of my first review  where i said the price was a little high  but at that point i hadn t noticed that both my local walmart and target carry it for less than  9 so don t buy it here   though it s a great coffee  i use this coffee as a drip grind coffee  not french press or expresso where so many people love it  it s still 5 stars this coffee is excellent  it s called a dark roast but it tastes more like a medium or medium dark roast and doesn t have much bitter burnt taste so common in such roasts  it s woody with a hint of a citrusy taste  it s a little creamy and earthy  there s a considerable complexity of tastes which reminds me of eight o clock s bocar blend  but bocar is not as bold   but it is around 2 3 the price   eight o clock s columbian  my most brewed in the am coffee  is as bold with a little less complexity and a more woody taste  again at 2 3 the price  it most closely reminds me of starbuck s caffe verona  which is a little more chocolately in taste and is usually around  8 for one about same sized bag at amazon  1 star for price  5 stars for taste,0,1

4873,i have been cycling a few hours in the heat on weekends  and using this type supplement to get what i need while riding  so i bought a case of the tangerine with caffeine  i have to say they seem to do the job and give me what i need  and the boost from the caffeine works as desired  the problem i have with the product is the taste is pretty bad  like concentrated children s aspirin  also  the container package seems to react with the my teeth or fillings  like having a battery on your tongue  so  basically consuming these is not pleasant  and i dread having to do it  like taking medicine   so  i will stick with the main competitor in this marketplace  gu   which taste great  not yummy  package reacts in mouth,0,1

749,i got this fence because i worried the one i got from my dad was to powerful around my pets and kids   i went through putting this one up and it worked for a little bit but the same day we put it up i bumped into it and no zap  so my husband check it out  and tightened some things and it worked he touched it and said it felt about like a 9volt battery as he was telling me he showed me again and he said it did not work  this went on for several minutes   also the poles are pretty flimsy pvc pipes not the ones it showed in the videos along with the product showing how to put it up    which is why i picked this one i gave it 2 stars because it looked a lot nicer than my previous fence that i now have to put back up after going to the store because i cut the wire in several places to put the new fence up  worked off and on  also not same poles as in video on product page,0,1
753,you know i read also about the health benefits of goji berries and i tell you the consumer is being hood winked   i dont disbute the antioxidant potential of the berry but it is extremely fattening   per 1 oz of berries you intake 100 calories versus only 16 for blueberries   now the sob s out there selling the plant and berry dont tell you that do they   man you cant trust anything   no wonder they are not popular despite the cancer causing potential id rather have a chocolate bar for that amount of calories   lol taste ok but boy its fattening,0,1
754,this cereal is masquerading as healthy   yes  it is organic and gluten free  but it also is a processed food containing a fair amount of sugar at 7g per serving  second ingredient is organic evaporated cane juice  and gets its fiber from added inulin  and maybe additional sweetening from this ingredient   rather than just from whole grains   the major grain constituents of corn meal flour and brown rice flour are not the healthiest grain ingredients but might be needed to get a decent gluten free cereal  this contains no oats  which are also gluten free    the amount of fiber per serving is 3g  not too great for a healthy cereal   this is not a fortified cereal  so vitamin a  c and calcium are 0  and iron only 4  of rda the package is somewhat deceptive in that it lists a serving as having relatively low calories  110 calories   but the reason becomes evident when looking into the serving size   the cereal serving size is 2 3c   30g   1 10 oz  which is smaller when compared to standard natural cereal serving sizes  which i have found to be more in the 1 5 to 1 8 oz range   so this is the reason that the calories appear lower   possibly this serving size may be more appropriate for children   as an adult  eating only 1 10 oz of this cereal does not fill me up the cereal tastes pretty good  if you like a sweet cereal  and i think kids would like this   it appears to be a mixture of organic versions of kix  hollow corn spheres   tiny rice krispies and some kind of fiber flakes  with tiny bits of other stuff  possibly sugar coated puffed quinoa etc    maybe it has a hint of vanilla flavor  but it mostly tasted sweet to me   it was quite good with fresh sliced strawberries on top and regular milk   the cereal did not appear as appetizing as the glossy photo on the package the box is only 10 6oz  so it won t last long if increasing the amount per serving and thus is not the best value   i suppose this cereal may be a good option for people who need a tasty sugary gluten free cereal   but there certainly are healthier and cheaper options out there  even standard oatmeal    rated 2 1 2 stars  rounded down to 2 stars  there are better choices out there,0,1

4880,the 4 pounds of sliced meat itself are contained in a single cardboard box  no vacuum seal or even plastic wrap   that box is placed in another box that is lined with styrofoam sides  styrofoam peanuts  and three frozen  ice  paks   it was shipped fedex 2 day  that s what the label says   not overnight or next business day  which begs the question  what exactly did the  52 in shipping charges for 4 lbs of meat and minimal packing materials actually go towards   i think i know  and it wasn t shipping years ago  grecian delight   the brand on the box  was sold in a local supermarket chain in gyro kit boxes   each contained a pack of sliced gyro meat  one pita  and a small container of tzatziki sauce   i loved them  but i haven t seen the kits in decades and was happy to find a way to once again stock the freezer with gyros in waiting the gyro meat itself  which i have ordered before  tastes just like     gyro meat   as i said  i love gyros  but there s no place nearby where i can drop in and enjoy one   so i have ordered the product in the past  but in this case  i ve ordered for the last time i ve gotten the individual 1 lb vacuum packets before 3 at a time and they ve arrived frozen or nearly frozen  not so this box   the meat was not only thawed  it was only slightly cool  i m afraid i m going to be throwing it out   too risky   for  52 shipping charges  it should have arrived in perfect condition  overnight  i won t make this mistake again   i can t afford to  have ordered before but this shipment was unusable,0,1

828,if you have a nostalgia store  or other shop that might have nostalgia candy   go there  for  18  you don t get a whole lot of candy  yeah  some of it is really fantastic and delicious  but it seems to have just been repackaged from recent productions of the candy  the box is also somewhat small and contains that crinkle paper confetti stuff for effect  i guess    but it takes up a lot of space in the box in all  i wish there was enough candy to justify paying  18 for it  but there really wasn t  cheaper just to go to wegman s or something ,0,1

4664,hmmm  i cannot say that i am a huge connoisseur of anchovies but i do enjoy them on a variety of dishes   my mother even made an amazing anchovy dressing in my honor   so it goes to say that i have tried a number of them and enjoy them thoroughly   now the jar is nice  it has a strange plastic thing in it which i do not care for personally  i think it is to hold the anchovies up or something   the olive oil is not anything special  extra virgin it may be but given that it is not organic and had a piece of plastic in it  i cannot really vouch for there being a superior aspect in that department   as for the chovies themselves  fairly standard   nothing really spectacular or amazing about them other then the fabulous price tag on these bad boys    16 00 for a jar of anchovies that in and of themselves do not distinguish themselves from any other standard anchovy   i tel you this much  i will pay for a product if it is good  even if i don t think i would pay that much given the option  i will pay it rather than not have that delicious taste   this  i will not be buying again   i will stick with crown prince anchovies in their little glass jars   thank you  anchovy fillets by scalia extra virgin olive oil,0,1

4645,there was a guy promoting these chocolate bars today and giving samples at whole foods  i overheard him talking about stevia and i approached somewhat curious  he invited me to try some of the flavors and i tried a tiny bite of the almond and coconut  i remarked it was impressive that they were really sweetened only with stevia  if you look on the front of the package it says  sweetened with stevia   he smiled and nodded and told me about how fast they were selling them  everyone loves them  i said great  i will buy 2 bars  and off i went now home with my reading glasses on i am reading the ingredient label these are the ingredients on the label  of the coconut flavor lily s dark chocolate bar unsweetened chocolateinulindextrin  from non gmo corn erythritolcocoa butterorganic coconutmilkfatsoy lecithinnatural flavorsstevia extractnatural vanillainulin  dextrin  from non gmo corn  and erythritol are featured a little too high on the list to make this food product i would consider  hardly a  whole  or  natural food  in my opinion  dextrin  which i had to google and is made by heating corn starch at a very high heat over an extending time and seems to be used in pyrotechnics and firecrackers  among other things  is the 3rd ingredient  notice where stevia is on the list  it seems that erythritol is the primary sweetener  which i guess sounds a lot less sexy  stevia people associate with the herb  even though the extract is highly processed read carefully before you buy  even at whole foods market it seems this product is being marketed in 2 primary ways as an  all natural  and  sugar free  stevia sweetened chocolate candy bar   through an association with the namesake  a little girl named lily who had brain cancer as a child    the company gives a portion of profits to non profits that help childhood cancer survivors in honor of co founder chuck genuardi s niece lily  who battled childhood brain cancer   of course it is wonderful that a portion of profits will help childhood cancer survivors in lily s honor  and it feels good to have our buying dollars support a good cause  i would just like to know what that means a little more precisely  like  what portion of profits and how will it help  childhood cancer survivors   if you are making an association like this  make it clear to make it credible  again  i am not implying any wrong here  it s just  fuzzy  and more so because of the ingredient label as far as i m concerned  and the way it is being promoted  read the ingredients carefully,0,1

4631,we picked this up as a sometime treat for our dog  we definitely will not be using this as the main food for her and i ll tell you why  if you note in the ingredients  the very first item listed is corn  which is not good for animals  it is a filler and isn t nutritious for them at all  the first ingredient in any good food should be meat  and corn should definitely not be in the top 5  let alone the first item  the next four ingredients are also terrible   chicken by product meal  corn gluten meal  whole wheat flour  beef tallow preserved with mixed tocopherols   chicken by product means not the actual meat of the chicken  but everything else  e g  bones  skin  organs  feet  etc    corn gluten meal is just more corn  wheat is the single most common allergen for dogs  beef tallow is rendered fat and tocopherols don t actually have vitamin e in them  but  may have  vitamin e sometimes so while your dog will love this for the same reason that people love big macs  it doesn t make it good for them and you can find better food for them for a similar price  just remember  no corn ever and meat should be the first ingredient  not good for your dog,0,1

4753,i have tried a few different clear shampoos and conditioners and so far  i have not liked any of them particularly well  this one is no different while the scent is nice   it smells like shea butter of course   it just doesn t perform well for me  i need to use a whole lot of it to get any kind of good detangling and softening conditioning  after i shampoo  i add conditioner  comb it through with a wide tooth comb and then put my hair up in a clip with the conditioner still in my hair  while i wash my body  so  conditioner always sits in my hair for a good 5 minutes or so  with this conditioner  i felt like i had to use so many heaping piles of it to get just a tad bit of detangling action  once i rinse it out  it almost feels like i never even used conditioner  most of the time i use my other conditioner  infusium23 or redken extreme  after rinsing this clear one out  if not  i use a leave in because my hair just doesn t feel moisturized or soft enough after using the clear  my hair is not particularly rough or damaged  so i shouldn t really need to use so much  i definitely don t need to use as much when using my regular brands it does smell good and rinse well  but there are no benefits to using it  it also does not seem to coat or weigh my hair down  but again no other benefits  i need a conditioner to help me detangle and soften my hair   things a conditioner typically does   this one just doesn t do any of that for me  not for me,0,1

859,the headline says it all  this flavor of nong shim soup smells like cat food  i don t know whether it tastes like cat food  because i ve never tasted cat food  but the overwhelming similarity in odor makes this soup very difficult to swallow don t take this as a negative review of the brand as a whole  i ve eaten a lot of nong shim noodle bowls  and i generally like them  the spicy chicken is probably my all time favorite powdered soup  it s a good way of getting reasonably full reasonably fast for very little money    and the spiciness can help you drink a lot of water if you need to  the packages are designed so you can use boiling water or a microwave  and the individual bowls are sealed  all in all  a good line of products    but this flavor stinks nong shim makes a lot of flavors  pick a different one  smells like cat food,0,1

888,as a general rule i gravitate toward heavy bodied  dark coffees but rules are made to be broken  from time to time even i bring home a medium blend to break things up  i was quite excited to give marley coffee a try but found that a name can t make up for a yucky cup as lovely as the idea behind this particular line of coffees is i found it lacked the body i look for in a cup of coffee  that said the taste was so pleasant and delicate i actually tossed a couple of the pods into my tea pot and used them like tea bags  the result was actually delicious but far more tea like than i would pay for in a coffee pod if you enjoy lighter roasts or prefer tea i would definitely recommend the one love organic coffee pods  otherwise i would suggest a pass  coffee for tea drinkers   ,0,1

4321,having worked in the canned seafood industry  i sampled this product at work for consistency  quality  and taste  it was excellent back in 2007  i soon relied on this product for lunch  with ritz crackers  genova tonno was very  very good  and also sometimes for snacks  i d buy them in bulk here on amazon at reasonable prices having worked with canned tuna  i can tell you the prices of the  commodity  have gone way up across the board for light tuna  e g  skipjack  and white tuna  e g  albacore   this is due to increased fishing cost and decreased supply of fish  as sad of an issue as overfishing due to the trawling methods  the reality is we re seeing this reflected in the cost and quality of various seafood products  most notably via the traditional 6oz cans being downsized to 5oz first by starkist followed by other shelf stable seafood manufacturers so this genova tonno product used to be chunks of tuna in extra virgin olive oil with a nice balanced amount of salt  however  this product is now watery chunky tuna that has a bit of olive oil in it  and in case you didn t know  genova is owned by chicken of the sea  who is actually owned by a thai based company called thai union  which has its own packing facilities in thailand  this is not italian tuna  do not let the name fool you  it is italian style  and like most of chicken of the sea products  genova tonno is packed in thailand  genova products are still very good and of a decent quality  but it just is not what it used to be because of the rising costs given the higher prices of this product  i no longer recommend this due to the  2  per 3oz can price tag  this used to make for a relatively healthy  affordable and delicious lunch or snack  but it is now not a very good value  i recommend other alternatives  skip the pre made canned tuna spread  it s got too much mayo and salt in it   or consider making your own tonno olive oil tuna  just try and look for  natural  tuna if you can since trusted brands  old fashioned canned tuna in water contains vegetable broth hydrolized protein that is injected to allow the fish to soak up more water  industry s dirty little secret   there are plenty of fast and easy to prepare tuna salmon options online if you look close hard enough on amazon    used to be excellent product  now watered down  i ll tell you why,0,1

3968,vitamin squeeze water enhancer is a water flavoring system like mio or other competitors  it has no calories  no carbs  and no sugar  how does it compare first  the container  this is a fairly large container  a bit larger than a can of soda  for 24 servings  other packages like the mio are able to provide the same flavoring amount in a much smaller  purse sized container  this vitamin squeeze also has to be refrigerated and used within 30 days  so that also makes it less of an easy to use product it is true that it has no calories  no carbs  no fat  no sodium  no protein  and no sugar  it also provides 120  of your vitamin c  as well as 40  of your vitamin b6  b5  b3  and b12  so you are getting some vitamins here ingredient wise  you get water  citric acid  vitamin c  natural flavor  sucralose  natural caffeine  and then a pile of chemicals but really  it all comes down to taste  my boyfriend and i have tested many water flavorings over the years  and this was just not good  it tasted like medicine  we experimented with different amounts  different techniques  and it simply was never as good as the many other options on the market  even let s say we wanted to have vitamin c in our diet  we d gladly eat a chewy  tasty orange vitamin rather than have to drink this  there s really no up side to using this as an alternative if there were no other water flavors at all available  and this was the only choice  then i might think about trying to get used to this flavor  but why would i  when there are delicious options out there  not only are there options that taste far better  but they re far easier to use and don t require refrigeration of course  i will caveat that we all have different taste buds  undoubtedly there will be some people who  for whatever reason  adore this flavor  that s fine  for them  this might be a good fit  after all there are people who adore the taste of cough syrup  so maybe that s a good way to judge  if you adore cough syrup and would drink it all the time  then this is probably to your liking  if not  then you probably want to try one of the many other options out there i was provided a free sample to review by the maker  cough syrup tasting,0,1

1476,immediately after drinking penta  i definitely felt  refreshed   whatever that means   the texture seems  smoother  and the water appears clearer  but i believe that these characteristics are merely psychosomatic and fall in line with thinking of what pure water means  i felt calmer overall  but i attribute this to the water  not the oxygen  otherwise  i think the oxygen takes away from the full benefit of the product after a few cycles of testing penta  my instincts kicked in and i started reading about the effects of too much oxygen in the body and brain  since it stands to reason that if penta is infusing their bottles with oxygen  their water would end up being impregnated with it  though the oxygen in their bottles could be minimal  it could be enough to offset the nitrogen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood after drinking enough of it  especially with their patented level of filtration  there s no doubt that penta water feels like it is being absorbed more readily than others  an effect which seems enhanced when drinking it cold  i have noticed this effect also when i had a bout of altitude sickness in colorado  at the time  someone recommended i drink plenty of water to feel better as it had oxygen in it  i found some bottled water  from another commercial brand  and drank as much as i could  i could literally feel the water oxygenate my body as i drank it logically  then  one might assume that water impregnated with oxygen would be better for you  i believe  though  that the benefits of oxygen in water are only met if the oxygen is within natural levels  penta claims they add oxygen only to tighten the bottle  i m sure their marketing team knew that people would come to their own conclusions about this statement and may assume that this was yet be another  purifying  aspect of penta water  i know of no other drink manufacturer adding oxygen just to tighten their bottle  so i doubt there is a real concern about its use for packing purposes  for some of you who drink several bottles of penta a day  you may want to consider how much you are over saturating your blood with oxygen i started doing some research on penta with a much more critical eye  that is when i found james randi  mr  randi  as some of you know  is a hyperbolic debunker and skeptic who has offered a one million dollar prize to anyone  who can show under proper observing conditions  evidence of any paranormal  supernatural  or occult power or event   after reading the letters   which can be read publicly online  exchanged between mr  randi and the owner of penta  i got the impression that the owner was just another health trend exploiter  not some arbiter of a new scientific frontier  the guy can t even spell  my thoughts are that this person stumbled upon the next trend of water purification and made a business decision to add a little something extra to merit a higher price point that would reap a greater profit than a competitor s brand  don t get me wrong  i believe that deionized  low ph  metals  and  trace pharma free water is legit  but claims that penta water is somehow more special than others using the same methods are truly unmitigated i think people who are health conscious these days are toeing the line between reasonable skepticism and hopeful hypochondriacs  i wanted to believe  like many people these days  that i could use an inexpensive regimen of pure supplements to undo any damage i ve done to my body  i imagine that people think that when something like water  a necessary ingredient for sustaining human life  is hard to come by in an unadulterated state  it somehow means that ingesting great amounts of pure water must act as some sort of great equalizer in the body  that if you drink clean water  you are aiding your body in being able to reverse and repair damage i m sure some of you think my impressions of penta are crackpot science at best  but consider how it is no different than staring at a few pdfs on the manufacturer s site  understanding none of it  and yet still believing a doctor claiming better benefits who was likely funded by penta themselves to do the research  this method of boosting the appearance of legitimacy for purified water is common  look up  ilumati lithia water   it appears they had involvement with a clinical trial from the university of british columbia  a study that has been suspended due to  logistical issues   it s not that as a given i don t believe in the truthfulness of clinical trials  i just won t fall prey to believing that a product is better simply because it was involved in a clinical trial  especially if the product developer has anything to do with it  think of how you yourself may be buying into quackery just by taking what a business driven for profit says at face value i urge you to take stock of your own body and share what you ve realistically experienced with penta  i still believe pure water is extremely helpful for the body s regulation  though this is not a cure all  based on the competition out there  i believe this could be the best water on the market   if oxygen wasn t placed in the bottle as  added value   hoping to start a less biased discussion,0,1

1490,we switched my son from enfamil infant looking for an organic comparable  we decided to try earth s best and although my son would drink it within the next day he was constipated  we decided to keep trying the formula until we finished and supplement him with apple juice and apple and pear purees to help him digest  four days later and he was still terribly constipated  and he struggled  we decided to change to baby s one and within a a day he was having some normal looking bowel movements  i was really disappointed that this formula was so harsh for his stomach  i think the intentions were good but it obviously isn t a complete trade off and i have read that they extra fortify the milk base formula with more lactose which makes it difficult for children to digest  my son is taking really well with baby s only and we will continue with this formula since its better than non organic  constipated my infant,0,1

3917,i ordered this without first reading the ingredients  was suckered in by the name and the packaging when looking at amazon s vine program offerings last month as a compulsive label reader and nutrition researcher this was completely my bad and i own it that said  this is one of the more expensive  junk foods  for dogs that i have seen lately   while it may have beef as the first ingredient  when you factor in all the remaining negative ingredients there is simply no way to offset the good with the bad   other reviews have gone into great detail on the ingredients and their negative impact on your pet s health so i m not going to repeat that   just chiming in it frustrates me when people say they can t afford to feed their families or pets good quality  nutritious food  as opposed to factory produced calories packaged in grocery stores and served in restaurants  when you factor in the cost to your health and the fact that you are nutritionally starving yourself  or your family pets  the cost for good food  and i mean food  not calories  is actually less expensive off the soapbox    junk food,0,1
3914,our family has liked every other flavored we have tried  bbq is the best   we like sweet potatoes so we assumed would like these pop chips   i was wrong  no one in the family likes the sweet potato pops chips i highly recommend you go to a store that sells the sweet potato before deciding on purchasing a large quantity  not a fan of the sweet potato pop chips,0,1
1504,for a couple of months my stomach had a  tight  feeling   like i couldn t relax it  i realized it started feeling that way around the same time i started drinking coco libre every day  i stopped drinking it and right away my stomach  relaxed  and it s been fine ever since  gave me tummy trouble,0,1
3908,some of the other reviewers have gone into great detail about the nutritional content of this  as well as the price difference   not only is there no need for me to repeat it all  i don t think i could do it justice as they had what i can do is agree with them   the dogs really like this   but the dogs don t know what s good for them  and they don t know when to stop   our dogs have been on rationed food in order to keep them trim and fit   one of them  a labradoodle  scarfs up the food so fast that she has to have her small portions doled out to her in smaller portions   and even then it seems half of it must go into her lungs since she s inhaling  not eating   this made it even worse as others have said  it s like candy for dogs compared to the other foods out there   and while the dogs seem to really love it  the owners have to be the ones in control  and use common sense   for a regular diet  i just don t see the content this offers as matching up to some of the better designed foods out there for pets   let s face it   in the multi billion dollar pet industry  there s more than enough choice out there to find what s the best content and at a reasonable price   i just don t think this is the answer for our dogs  like many others  i don t see this as a good long term food for pets   ,0,1
3901,my son loves these fiddlesticks so i buy them   yes  it s expensive and yes  i worry about giving it to him in the car  in case i slam on the break  or when he is running around  in case he falls  but overall  i m happy with the ingredients and i will keep buying   having said that  i am not completely happy with regard to amazon s fulfillment   i purchased these in september 2012 and the expiration date shows october 2012   this is the second time i received  nearly  expired fiddlesticks from amazon   i purchased different flavour fiddlesticks from a local retail store before i purchased these from amazon and its expiration date is april 2013   that makes me think that these particular fiddlesticks have been sitting in the hot amazon warehouse for over 8 months before my son gets his hands on them   technically  they are not expired but i don t think i will buy these again from amazon   i don t like to give snacks to my son that often and i m not sure if he will finish all 6 boxes in 30  days  questionable expiration date,0,1
3974,checking nutrition info on this product today at the eugene  or costco  these snacks appeared to be remarkably healthy for a fruit snack  i did a double take  and  a triple take on the number of servings per box  number of servings is triple the number of pouches in the box  serving size   9 pieces  if the snackers in your world are sufficiently disciplined  or smallish of appetite  to be satisfied with a third of a pouch of fruit snacks  bon appetit sidebar  if you could be so polite as to not add to costco s excessive packaging habit by re packing your fruit snacks into baggies of nine  well  that would be appreciated and more power to you  nutrition info misleading,0,1
1453,i have to say this is a bewildering product   when do i apply it   during a shower  afterwards   there are no instructions  so i simply tried many ways of using it before writing this review using it in the shower  this makes my hair too oily to dry and style properly    what would be the point of washing the product out   and  anyway  i tried  and found it took at least two shampooings   which defeats the purpose of  nourishing my scalp     using before bedtime results in oily pillows   before brushing my hair in the mornings is a bit better  but then my hair looks oily and flat probably the most worrisome effect associated with  clear scalp  would be  get ready for  eewwww     bigger dandruff flakes   that s right  my scalp felt nice  and i got less flakes  but they are much  much bigger in diameter since i started using this product as another reviewer here says  it is basically mineral oil with fragrance  oil that smells nice,0,1
3978,the ginger taste in these cookies is just about right but i would have preferred a cookie a bit less hard crispy  these are a bit too difficult to eat in that respect for my liking although i guess that s why the call  em  snaps   too hard crisp,0,1
1447,this shampoo definitely looks good from the packaging so i was hopeful that it would also be a good shampoo  upon opening the bottle  i can tell that it smells great  it kind of reminds me of pantene pro v or pert plus  i got compliments from my husband after that it smelled good and it did smell good for days however  the shampoo didn t seem like it really cleaned my hair  afterwards  it was still a little slick and after just one day  it was filled with grease and needed another washing  i also started to notice that my hair was falling out more than usual so i stopped using this i really thought it might be good from the smell but i can t have a bald head  left my hair feeling greasy  only pro is that it smells good,0,1

1411,i ve got a tiny hamilton beach single cup coffee maker that uses senseo pods  these melitta pods make a terrible cup of coffee in the machine  versus senseo pods that actually turn out reasonably tasty for something so easy  i usually like a nice strong coffee  ie french press  aeropress   but for weekdays i settle for a quick and easy cup to get me going  however  the melitta pods don t meet even a basic definition of coffee as far as i can tell  i ve actually tried soaking the pods directly in hot water  and even then there is very little flavor  kind of unbelievable  there is plenty of caffeine  just no taste whatsoever  makes very weak coffee with a hamilton beach single cup machine,0,1
4031,ask a chinese friend about  forbidden rice     31105   31859    unless they are history buff like myself  they will give you a puzzled look   the term refers to an obscure trade policy during manchurian dynasty  not an exotic rice   i will not going to bore you  with history here the story about emperor depriving commoners of red rice is a hoax made in america  like the legion of fortune cookies  most fortune cookies are made in a wholesome factory near atlanta   we trust that fortune cookies are safe to eat    forbidden rice  there is a red rice in china  dark red  close to red bean   the color varies from gran to gran  its thick bran provides a pleasant nutty flavor and al dente texture   the color does not come off easily   you can get them from chinese grocery store what is sold as  forbidden rice  at amazon and costco has a uniformed black to deep purple color   it appears to be rice over milled  dyed  and polished   drop a few grains in water  you can see color coming off   and the color tent to sink to the bottom  that is a easy tell tail   when cooked  the favor and texture of bran are absent   if they use red rice  they have milled away its bran to make the rice easy to dye there is nothing wrong with using food coloring   but is the ink fda approved   we do not know   the label does not say i am returning mine to costco   i will ask costco to pull it off the shelf  stop  read my review before consuming this product,0,1

1412,the product description on line that i read  doesn t mention that this is for relaxed and natural hair   when i got the product  the container says it s for relaxed and natural hair    relaxed to me means curly hair that has been chemically relaxed   i wouldn t have got this product  had i known that   typically  the type of hair that gets straightened is very thick and dry  so this product could be for them   i would still question even that though  knowing how difficult this stuff is to wash out  with no instructions with it there s no telling how exactly to use this   as a former hairstylist  i ve seen similar looking products used on straightened hair to help smooth it down with a flat iron  but  it s not advertised to use that way it s thick and by the other reviewers seems to be very difficult them to wash out too   maybe similar to putting vaseline on you hair   it says for the scalp and hair  but to even get on my scalp  it would get on my hair  so not a product for me  not sure who could use this product ,0,1
4028,product was received in good shape  the problem is that there was little packaging of the individual packets  and no date of manufacture nor  best used by  date  which leaves one wondering if this is a way of dumping outdated stock  disappointed    good seasons salad dressing,0,1
1414,it is zero calories so i figured i would try  grocery store brand was much better  but still not great  only way that it is tolerable is after cooking them  you store them overnight with chili  spaghetti sauce  etc  it will soak up some of the flavors that do make them tolerable  not very tasty,0,1
4025,i had purchased a bottle of this manuka honey earlier from amazon and it had done wonders for my dog s intestinal problems   this is my second bottle but the consistency of the honey is far different from the first one i ordered   this bottle of honey is thin and runny   much more like a sauce than a real honey consistency  and lighter in color   i have never seen honey this texture in my life   a new whole foods just opened up nearby and i purchased a bottle of wedderspoon 16  there   when this bottle runs out  i will be very interested to see what texture the one purchased at whole foods looks like  confused about texture,0,1
4024,wow  am i ever intrigued  schwan shipped my order from their minnesota headquarters to florida by ground ups  and  among other perishables  was included chocolate almond ice cream and strawberry yoghurt  i haven t received the shipment  and i tried to cancel the entire order because i saw that schwan wasn t taking any action on it  but they pre empted me by ignoring the cancel request and shipping it ups ground two day actually  what is even more mystifying is that schwan s knew there are schwan delivery trucks all over this region of florida  and i am positive that there is a schwan delivery route only 3 10 of a mile from where i live  so  they could have been less malicious about this by getting a refrigerated schwan delivery truck to deliver the goods in the insulated bag with the ice cubes and gel packs that is standard for such deliveries this is written after i got delivery of the above by ups ground three days later  schwan s replied to my requests to cancel two days after i sent them  in other words  on the day i received delivery truth to tell  schwan s was playing a joke  because they use plastic insulated picnic chests full of dry ice to ship their products by ups ground  and the products all arrive frozen solid  many with nearly quite acceptable wholesome ingredients  they don t mention the dry ice  so wondering how the product would survive shipping is the joke on the customer so far  i ve sampled the ice cream and the strawberry yoghurt  both of which are better quality from a wholesomeness standpoint than available at local markets  the wonton soup with the pork wonton has an ingredients list that is anything except wholesome  almost like a joke on people who eat pork  undoubtedly  the next time you read a schwan s catalog on the amazon web site  the wonton soup will have fake vegetarian pork in it so  for the dairy goods sampled so far using my microwave to defrost  like my kids used to say   yummy  yummy in the tummy  oh  and it s a good idea to dispose of the ups packaging quickly  because the dry ice evaporates into carbon dioxide which is not safe to breathe in quantity in an enclosed area and could become a lawsuit issue of the kind we innocent consumers are so fond of these days  mystery of ground shipped ice cream,0,1
1419,ok   so i wrote my review too early   since the initial  capture   i have bagged a couple more of the furry garden  terrorists   unfortunately  their relatives continue to excavate in and around my garden   the problem  the trip mechanism is not sensitive enough  as i suspected and wrote in my initial post    my catch rate is less than 10   and i usually find the unsuccessful sets filled with dirt and untripped   i just ordered 6 macabee traps and will post a review there after a few days of using them initial post   i have pocket gophers running amuck in and near my vegetable garden   tried the smoke bombs without success   after watching a number of videos on you tube about trapping gophers  i decided to take a whack at it   at two different sites  i found new mounds  probed for the main trench  excavated  set traps in each direction  wired the traps to a stake  and replaced the sod   18 hours later  the first set had caught a gopher by the tail   one clunk on the head with a shovel and i was on the board  the other set  i presume  was not placed deep enough in the hole as the gopher simply pushed dirt up into my trap   the only drawback that i perceive about the product is that the bump plate requires a pretty hard  bump  to spring the trap   but  with one gopher in the bag after the first 18 hours  i am willing to keep using   update to  caught one on the first try  ,0,1

4005,worthy of 2 stars because  quite honestly  this is probably the  best tasting  con queso dip i ve tried among any supermarket brands out there not worthy of more because i recently decided to read the label and was shocked to find why it s so  great tasting  and incredibly addictive at that  sure it doesn t have  msg  in the list of ingredients  but it does have  maltodextrin    modified corn starch    spices    natural flavor   all of which are controversial  maltodextrin commonly creates free glutamates  modified corn starch is pretty much used exclusively for that purpose   modified  by processing to free the glutamates   and of course  spices  and  natural flavor  are most commonly known as just another way of labeling msg without having to actually put  msg  on the label shame on any food maker that loads up foods with heavy amounts of free glutamates  poisoning us all with addictive neurotoxins just to turn a profit further shame on any food maker that does so and then has the cojones to dare say  no msg  as part of marketing that product and honestly  i can t understand for the life of me why this comes from on the border  makers of one of the only good salsa s on the market that actually doesn t contain any of these controversial ingredients  how about creating a spin off of this product with all the neurotoxic free glutamates removed from the mix so people who care about their health and mental well being can enjoy one of the best tasting con queso s on the market  without worrying about any adverse side effects  addictively good  but that s the problem   ,0,1

1581,i m almost on the fence with this one  but more body weight is leaning toward the  no  side   the tea leaf flavor itself is quite nice   the subtle flavor of south carolina s black tea is interestingly different from what i drink on a daily basis  and i like that change every once in a while  also  the tea leaves seem very fresh   i like the governor grey and breakfast teas for a simple  linear tasting black tea  but there are still other brands i gravitate toward for more complexity  mighty leaf has a wonderful earl grey with stronger bergamot flavor    the problem with this particular tea is that the peach flavoring is strange and sometimes reminds me of chemically scented plastic  a warning sign of artificial flavoring    i did double check to make sure the  peach flavor  mentioned in the ingredient list is natural  and the website for the charleston tea plantation affirms that a natural essential oil is used in all of their teas  but the peach tastes so chemical compared to other  more natural teas i ve had   you know  the teas that have visible bits of fruit in it   when i checked the reviews on the charleston tea plantation website  i noticed that someone else had left a review mentioning the same chemical taste   this tea is refreshing and easy to drink  but i just can t get over the weird peach aftertaste that lingers just a bit too long and too strongly   maybe it s just a personal preference  many other people seem to love this tea   but i m going to stick with green hill tea s peach apricot loose tea because it is much better  and the ingredients seem better  taken from their website  black tea  natural dried papaya  freeze dried peach   apricot  blackberry leaves  sunflower   calendula petals  natural flavours   strange chemical peach flavor   is this natural ,0,1

3795,in my experience  working with around 300 cats at our local animal shelter   fresh step tends to be too strongly scented for most cats   they would prefer to use an unscented litter and sometimes will go outside of their litter box so they don t have to use this litter  not often  but sometimes    as far as its consistency  most cats are ok with it because it is so smelly  it does a good job of camouflaging odor  but if you have a picky cat  i d choose an unscented or less strongly scented litter  scent is too strong for many cats ,0,1

3773,it was the packaging that sold us with this leonard mountain boot scootin  green chile chili when my son and i were online here  looking for some interesting new chili variations  this one seemed different from some of the others  so we bought this pack of three 12oz bags  not cheap  but it seemed interesting at the time we unpacked the shipment upon arrival  and found that each one had the following   one genuine boot scootin  burlap bag  with a drawstring  see the user photo   one miniature bottle of genuine tabasco green pepper sauce  enough for one person   chili seasonings  containing onions  garlic  salt  black pepper and green chilies  10 oz  of whole pinto beansthe nutritional info states the following  serving size 12 oz  servings per container about 6  calories 90  calories from fat 10  total fat 1g  saturated fat 0g  trans fat 0g  cholesterol 0mg  sodium 101mg  total carbs 19g  dietary fiber 2g  sugars 1g  protein 2g  vitamin a 0   vitamin c 0   calcium 4   iron 2   based on a 2 000 calorie diet the product description was quite unusual  to say the least  uncle charlie jus adds in sum of his real special dried green tabascy plants to het up this chili  now the boys  round these parts reely lak this chili bettrn the red sissy chili  most the womens think the green s a little hot fer thur sweet lips  taste test without all of the boring details  we followed the enclosed directions to the letter  adding ground beef to keep the initial batch as simple as possible  it smelled good as it was cooking  but we had to increase the cooking time  simmering it gently for an extra hour as it was a little flat  let s just say that it was disappointing  and that s an understatement  for the next attempt  we tried the time tested method of cooking the chili the day before  letting it cool down  then refrigerating the batch overnight to give all the flavors time to blend  that was a very slight improvement  but not by much  let s just say that it was reminiscent of some chili that i once had at an obscure new jersey diner that s no longer in business  there never was a third attempt sometimes it s just better to do it yourself  this is the recipe that i use for  diy slow cooked chili  that i learned years ago when living in the south  and the one that i fall back on when in the mood for cooking   2 lb  ground beef  1 1 2 cups chopped onions  1 2 cup chopped green pepper  2 garlic cloves  finely cut  not chopped   28 oz  can whole tomatoes  2  16 oz   cans kidney beans  2 tbsp  chili powder  2 tsp  salt  2 tsp  cumin  2 tsp  black pepperbrown the ground beef  add onions  green pepper  garlic  tomatoes  kidney bens  salt  chili powder  pepper and cumin in a slow cooker or crock pot  cover and simmer on low setting for 6 to 8 hours  makes 8 to 10 servings  serve with cornbread and whatever hot sauce you like  looking forward to trying tabanero hot sauce picante  as it s been highly recommended notes this company also makes redneck chill e spicy and redneck habanerah allives  you ll just have to look at that one   but to date this reviewer has resisted the temptation to try either of these or their other offerings  however  i did receive a box of leonard mountain 3 amigos enchilada stew as a gift from a friend  and this product was easily worth a 5 star recommendation  that was one of the reasons that i tried their chili mix  go figure bottom line cannot say that leonard mountain boot scootin  green chile chili was the worst chili mix that i ve ever had  but it s probably borderline close  what one pays for here is cute slogans and clever packaging  and this product is highly overpriced for what you get  sad to say  even those chili seasoning packets you find in the spice section of your grocery store are better  but the burlap bag packaging was clever  and my son kept the miniature tabasco green pepper sauce bottle  so i ll give it one star each for the creative packaging and the tiny tabasco bottle 9 4 2012 boot scootin  green chile chili  great packaging  but   ,0,1
1607,i did not find ultra shea conditioner to be any better than my regular regimen   if anything it may have been more drying i tried the product as directed with very poor results   immediately after drying my hair  it felt even drier than before i shampooed and conditioned  within two days i had to wash my hair again  as it was bone dry i decided to give the conditioner another try  this time as a deep conditioner along with the clear scalp   hair beauty therapy ultra shea nourishing scalp   hair oil  3 fluid ounce   there was some improvement in the overall moisture levels of my hair  but not enough to warrant changing from my routine of cholesterol and coconut oil conditioners   within days my hair was dry and brittle    other than the hair dryer  i do not use any heated appliances on my hair  i tried the conditioner once more as directed with the same results as before because of the increased need to shampoo  condition  and dry my hair  i feel like i experienced more breakage than i normally would have under my normal routine  not for every follicle   ,0,1

3823,i usually only buy freshly roasted beans from various online stores  but bought these on a whim while ordering some other stuff from amazon when i received the beans  i was immediately disappointed with the bag which did not appear to be vacuum sealed very tightly  the date on the bag indicated something to the effect of  sell by 6 23 2013  which tells me that these beans were probably roasted in june of 2012  it s now september  which means these beans have been sitting in the bag for 2  months with a less than ideal seal  not good when i opened the bag and took a  whiff   the beans smelled okay but definitely didn t have that rich chocolaty aroma that i m used to with freshly roasted beans  the beans all have an even dark appearance with a mild oil sheen  no burned charcoal in this bag  which is good i had my first cup this morning and was less than thrilled with the brewing aroma  it again lacked the richness that i m used to with my other blends  the flavor can be described in the same way  it s not bad at all  but not particularly outstanding  compared to the  established  household name brand beans that you can pick up in any grocery store  cameron s organic french roast is a definite step up in flavor but it just can t compete with the roasted to order boutique blends if you can manage to get these beans freshly roasted and in a tight vacuum sealed bag  where so much air has been sucked out that the beans all leave impressions in the side of the bag   this may very well be an excellent coffee  as it was shipped to me    it s only fair  edit  06 sep 2012   spelling corrections  i must have been half asleep when i typed this  need    more    coffee       it s  worth noting that i ground up the entire bag and brought it to my workplace for my coworkers to use in the office coffee maker  they are accustomed to drinking long oxidized grocery store purchased name brand coffee  which i refer to as  butt blend    cameron s is a real treat for their defiled palates  fair aroma and flavor  not particularly fresh ,0,1

1257,this product may be great for tanning  over your sunscreen of course   but it is not good for cooking unless you are making a coconut pie  cake or cookies  gf of course  because it tastes and smells like coconut i should have been tipped off by the plastic container and by what appears to be a lower than i expected melting point  but i admit that i was looking for an economical solution to subscribe   save for my adult children as i do all that i can to help them eat right   i am telling them to use this as body oil and i will buy them some spectrum naturals coconut oil  not good for cooking,0,1
1255,i started buying iams weight control and was keep buying it for 2 years  the purpose was to keep cat s weight under control  but he was hungry all the time and demanded more and more food  even though  i was giving him half less food portion that it was recommended on the package  he was keeping gaining weight  his weight was 12 pounds two years ago  now it is 19 pounds    veterinarian told us that he is obese and should be on the diet to reach at least 15 lb  he should get only 270 kcal per day and no more  now i am giving my cat purina weight control  cat s behavior is completely different    he is so much happier  and is not demanding food anymore  as a tip  add water to your cat dry food  it helps with prevention of urinary track problems  also  serving sizes should be smaller than it is recommenced on the packages back to the iams weight control  i personally believe that they add some kind of appetite simulating substances into there food  and should be sued for this  cat gained 7 pounds after 2 years diet on this food,0,1
4244,the pickles were a bit on the limp side  hot but without much taste   brooklyn brine pickles usually have such a great taste   what a shame    bb could have done better,0,1
4309,product is dry and very very crunchy  not very tasty either  not sure what the flavor is supposed to be  it is moderately decent considering the fiber and protein content but i will go back to my fiber one choc and oats which is yummy  not as good as it looks,0,1
4307,these will grow very rapidly but quickly go out of control  spreading millions of little round seeds that blow in the wind and sprout new trees everywhere next to your foundation  in sidewalk cracks and agricultural fields  then are very difficult to eliminate as they will regrow from roots even if you cut them down please avoid invasive,0,1
4303,this item is shaved so thin the texture is like paper  although my cats are attracted by the  very noticeable  fish smell they are unsure how to handle the texture  it has no satisfying crunch or bite resistance and flakes all over the place leaving a mess  i wouldn t buy it again  flaky treat,0,1
1205,it took a couple of days for my dogs to convince themselves that this was ok to eat  but then that happens anytime you change food   i purchased the product due to its high fiber content to try and relieve the dragging of the butt on carpet syndrome   it is too early to tell if successful but it is apparent that their bms appear to be easier  quicker  and a lighter color and i m still mixing the nutrisca w  their old food 50 50   i believe this will be a great product for my dogs  digestive health so  to amend my previous review  yes it does have more fiber but my dogs refuse to eat it so i guess i have to rate it lower than my original review  more fiber,0,1
4301,this bar seems to be made of popped rice  like rice krispies   with carrot cake flavoring the carrot cake flavor is good  with the cinnamon and cream cheese icing flavors but the texture is like stake rice krispie squares   not nice and soft like good rice krispie squares  good flavor but texture is like a stale rice krispies square,0,1
4299,i ve been addicted to this stuff for years  and over the years i ve bought it from a variety of sources so i think i have the experience to say that  11 93 for one can is an absolutely insane price   until andunless this supplier comes to his senses  get it somewhere else  insane price,0,1

4292,my spicy world brown sesame seeds arrived with a living worm crawling around inside the package   read the reviews for other spicy world sesame seeds and you will discover  as i did  that worms in their sesame seeds is a common problem   i was very disappointed   amazon issued a refund also  there is no way to tell how old this product is   a representative of spicy world said they are not required to print an expiration date on this product because they package it as a spice i have videos of the worm to upload  but i don t agree with amazon s terms    3  license grant for materials  you hereby grant to amazon and its affiliates a worldwide  nonexclusive  royalty free  perpetual right and license to  a  reproduce  distribute  transmit  publicly perform and publicly display the materials  in whole or in part  in any manner and media   b  modify  adapt  translate and create derivative works from the materials  in whole or in part  in any manner and media  and  c  sublicense the foregoing rights  in whole or in part  to any third party  with or without a fee   worm ,0,1

4285,i can still remember captain midnight sitting there in the uniform of an astronaut of the 50 s  khaki shirt and black four in hand tie  telling me solemnly that i should drink my ovaltine because it tasted good and it was good for me  it was  after all  brown and that meant it had to be chocolate  my favorite flavor what the uranus traveler never told me was that they were crystals that would sit at the top of the warm milk and never dissolve  furious stirring with a metal tool called a spoon didn t do it  nor did trying to grind them up against the side of the cup   even using a tenderizer tool didn t work as i soon discovered that as you pushed it down the cup  the warm milk came up and out  you had to compromise by trying to round up the little critters on the spoon and that offered little comfort as the crunchy buggers didn t taste all that great anyway  to top it off  all you had left was warm milk the jar of ovaltine was also very resilient  it lasted a long time in our home  it was the same one  even my father who liked the  old standbys  of shredded wheat and corn flakes we never ate  didn t go near this stuff i only recommend this for those who have lost their taste buds through constant sword swallowing or that fire breathing trick captain midnight  you lied to me  captain midnight  you lied to me ,0,1
4177,outstanding taste  i haven t had another gf cookie that can compare  yes the cookies have a great taste but all the cookies were smashed into crumbs upon arrival  didn t do much for the event i was planning to serve them at  but i used the crumbs as a fun part of a cereal mix  great taste but     ,0,1
1220,for some reason my dogs just didn t like this food   i began by mixing it with their regular food  similar ingredients but much cheaper   and they actually picked the pieces of it out   i have a golden retriever  a golden retriever lab mix  and a chihuahua whippet puppy   the only one that actually liked the food was the puppy  but she still eats puppy chow  so i didn t give her a lot the only way i could get my dogs to eat this food was to add something to it  like a little bit of canned food  which they don t normally get   i found it unusual because they usually aren t picky eaters  but they just didn t like this food   since i had a large bag  i had to add something to it every night in order to get through the bag   they would still leave some food in their bowls  which the chihuahua would eat i see by the other reviews that most of the dogs loved the food  but for some reason mine were the exception  i couldn t get my dogs to like this food  and they re usually not picky ,0,1
1225,the coffee is delicious the problem is every time we try to brew it  it clogs my cuisinart k cup brewer i had the same problem with this brand in decaf it doesn t happen with any other brand so i know it is the grind of this particular coffee i will be throwing it out  donut house collection light roast k cups,0,1
4273,these do not taste like banana s and are an odd pink shade  i m sure it s difficult to preserve pureed banana  but citric acid  predominantly found in citrus and berries  makes this food less than ideal to introduce to an infant  citrus  berries  fish and egg whites are listed by our pediatrician as  wait until they re old enough  foods due to allergies or the irritation they causes some infants btw we normally love earth s best products  citric acid in product,0,1
1232,i ordered it with the intention of using it on the garden of my daughter in law while visiting my son this summer   she has complained about chipmunks eating her flowers and this seemed to be a good way to deal with the problem   initially she was very enthused about testing this product  especially after i showed her on the amazon description that it could be safely used around pets   safe for use around children and petsmade from all natural ingredients  critter ridder is organic materials review institute  omri  listed and usda approved for use in organic gardening  because it s epa registered  parents can feel confident using critter ridder around their children and pets  however when she read the fine print and discovered this  precautionary statement  she declined to give it a try  hazards to humans and domestic animals   caution  causes moderate eye irritation  if there is anything that my daughter in law enjoys more than her garden  it is her 2 cats   the possibility of causing discomfort to her  children  or somebody else s dog or cat was enough to deter her from using this product the product may be very effective  but the advertising in misleading   i m sure there are many other pet lovers with gardens that would like a product that deters pests but does not harm pets   they shouldn t be assured it was safe for pets then find otherwise in fine print after making the purchase  can irritate pets  eyes  advertising misleading,0,1
4267,like many people who are gluten intolerant  i have many other food sensitivities that are not related directly to gluten   these crackers have dehydrated tamari sauce in them  the tamari is what gives the crackers a great taste  i suspect this is what some reviewers decide is  burnt grain   however in my case tamari is a trigger for interstitial cystitis pain   i would normally deduct only two stars for this  since my food sensitivities are not the fault of this maker  however  the price is absolutely absurd   i have no clue why anyone would pay this much for a  6  7 box of crackers   check your local health food store   such stores are notorious for price gouging  but even so they will be radically cheaper than here  taste better than most gluten free but grossly over priced,0,1
1238,ground yellow corn  corn gluten meal  animal fat preserved in mixed tocopherols and soy  be very careful of these ingredients if you spot them in any dog food  it s a giant red flag  it seems a lot of dog food these days just have to have them  my dog absolutely loved this brand  but at the moment  i am treating this bag as a treat  just like we give chocolate to kids  we know they aren t really good for your health  but i am hoping giving them once in a while won t hurt them too much go with certified brands like canidae and wellness  and stay away from ones that contain those ingredients i listed above  my puppy says it s delicious  but she also says it hurts its tummy   ,0,1
4257,my dog hates this food  and through some research i have found that science diet is not very good quality  i have instead switched over to orijen  a little more expensive but worth it for a healthier and happier dog  not good quality,0,1
4253,i purchased the hazelnut pods and the coffee tastes great  however  some pods open up while brewing allowing grinds to get in your coffee as well as all over your coffee maker  i had to run water through the coffeemaker 2 or 3 times to clean it out  as much as i like the coffee  i won t purchase again as i ve never had this issue before with other coffee brands  pods open up when brewing,0,1
1247,i have a 6 month old pomeranian puppy who loves chewing   i introduced this product to him  along with a compressed rawhide stick  and a himalayan dog chew  himalayan dogs chew 3 to 5 pieces for dogs up to 20 pound  3 1 2 ounce  at the same time   he jumped on the compressed rawhide and did not stop until he d eaten it all about a week later   he looooooved this thing   it must have tasted super good   he then tried the antler for maybe a day    it had an interesting smell coming from the part that was cut  and so he chewed on this for a little bit and got some of the hard interior out  but that was it   he s loving the himalayan dog chew though and now carries it everywhere    it s very hard but can be bitten through and eaten if he works at it long enough  and he seems to like the flavor of it   he s totally forgotten about the antler   it s just sitting on the floor now   it s just too hard for him i tried at least   i want him to have more natural treats and chew toys   like another reviewer said earlier  it definitely depends on your dog and you won t know until you ve bought the product and tried it out  6 month old puppy did not really go for this,0,1
1248,i would rather spend the time and effort for a better flavor  the pods are individually sealed  and easy to use  the flavor is not great at all  not a great flavor but cleaner than ground coffee,0,1

1366,if you plan on purchasing this item through kitty hawk wholesale as a gift  and think it will arrive by a certain date  think again   my experience with kitty hawk wholesale was that they dragged their heels on getting this item out and then they lied regarding when it was shipped and when it would arrive   maybe they prefer to only ship on certain days   who knows   but the popcorn was great   my father much enjoyed it when he finally got to sit down with it  two days after father s day  bad shipping   decietful customer service,0,1

1379,i tried using this product for about a year with no success  i m sure this works great in loamy lawns but i have plants  not grass  and live in suburban california  which means lots of clay  it is extremely difficult to find mole runs except in winter when the rain softens the clay  for my particular situation  i ve found the cinch mole traps to be extremely effective   they worked in a week  i did modify my method to try to match what other reviewers and youtube videos show  but if you don t have a nice soft lawn  there are better tools to catch moles with  not useful in ca,0,1
1382,i was excited to try out a new shampoo  especially one that is chocked full of shea and other healthy oils for your hair  i usually don t fall for the hype when a shampoo says  for relaxed and natural hair  but i m willing to give things a go at least once  when i opened the box  the product had leaked all over the bag but i was able to salvage a good amount of the shampoo  it smells great  it isn t overpowering but nice and subtle  as i began to use the product i was happy that the consistency was nice and thick  perfect for my thick and natural  african american hair  and it foamed up nicely as i worked it throughout my scalp when i went to wash it out is when the love affair ended  my hair was left feeling like it wasn t clean and i had this nasty residue left on my hair  it felt like i needed to rewash my hair with a different shampoo  my hair didn t feel softer or moisturized  it felt weighed down and lifeless  my curls were frizzy and dull  so i flipped over to the ingredient side and i realized this shampoo has quite a bit of ingredients  including silicones  that have no business being on my hair   this is being shoved in the back of the cabinet for days when i run out of my regular shampoo  leaves filmy residue behind,0,1
4076,so this water seems to have a lot of hype surrounding it with added ph and electrolytes for flavor along with lots of other beneficial extras  however i m not to sure how impressed i am with it overall the water itself seems to have a filmy taste to it although my kids didn t seem to notice if the water is chilled its somewhat less noticeable  the price for 12  1 5 liter bottles seems to fluctuate quiet a bit on here since the price yesterday was double what it is today  the size of the bottle is nice especially for a work environment so you don t have to get up as much for refills as far as this water is concerned  i think ill just stick to tap water or something like mountain spring bottled water instead  water by any other name,0,1
4075,as an omnivore with a 100 200 gram daily protein intake  i am always looking to diversify my protein sources   for protein supplements  i find the best value at costco when purchasing cytosport whey protein that costs approximately 2 2 cents per gram of protein   yet  it gets boring eating from the same six pound bag for months   so  i recently evaluated two vegetable based protein supplements  nutribiotic rice protein and manitoba harvest hemp protein  both with chocolate flavoring   while the rice protein has great economics  tastes fantastic and contains few carbs  this hemp protein fails in all three categories when i initially tasted manitoba harvest hemp protein  the first thought that came into my mind was  is this product really suitable for human consumption     olfactory memories from large scale grass cutting arose   even with the rich dark chocolate  i can t consume this protein straight or even mixed with milk   the pungent taste needs to be blunted with large amounts of cinnamon and splenda and or mixing with high protein cereals such as kashi or special k another undesirable aspect of this protein includes the large amount of carbohydrates   2 1 grams for every gram of protein  the economics are underwhelming as well   it costs about 10 8 cents per gram of protein versus 2 7 cents per gram for the nutribiotic rice protein or 2 2 cents per gram of protein for the cytosport offering at costco consterrible tastehigh carb contentpoor economics prosrich dark chocolate flavoring awful tasting protein partially masked by rich chocolate   4x as expensive as rice protein alternatives,0,1
4074,i have had hatch green chilies that i have roasted myself and also the green chili sauce hatch puts out under the stokes label  the stokes is definitely good  my on recipes with fresh roasted chilies are exceptional because of the freshness  the acidity in the canned chilies makes them taste like vinegar with no heat  don t bother   buy fresh and roast your own  they freeze well  they come into season annually in middle august   absoulutely the only way to go  disappointed,0,1
1385,i think this product is designed more for africa american women  as it is more of a heavy scalp treatment product and very oily   i could see where it would be a good shine product for black hair  but too heavy of a conditioner for other  white women  hair types   i will probably use this for a foot softening treatment and not on my hair   it does smell very good though  this product is very heavy,0,1

4111,i have made this product a few times  to the boxes specifications but it always goes bad fast  it is tasty and perfectly done for the first day or two  but after that no matter if you store it in the fridge or keep it out it goes bad very fast  i do a lot of cooking and baking and have a lot of experience with gluten free things but this one is a little funky  i think it is the type of flours they put into the mix  if you plan to eat it all in the first day go ahead and make it  but if not i would try something different  tasty but goes bad fast ,0,1
1307,this is the equivalent of donuts for cats   i ve never met a cat who doesn t like it  but if you look at the ingredients  it is so bad for them   the carbohydrate level is way above the need of any cats   cats don t digest carbohydrates  so technically do not need any in their diet   and if you look at the  meat  in the food  it s all fillers and by products   but the folks at fancy feast sure know how to make delicious cat food   when my cat had her cancer and wasn t eating anything  even she would lick the gravy of fancy feast   so if you can afford it  please only use this as a once in awhile junk food   i mean  you wouldn t eat a dozen of donut every day  would you   i would only use this food to add in small amounts to healthy  but not as palatable  food so my cats will eat it  junk food  but i m sure it s delicious ,0,1
4169,the wrapping is secure and nicely designed and that s the end of the good news i m not sure this bar qualifies as food  it is like single slice cheese  in that it seems like a  food product  and not an actual food  it is dry  crumbly  and not better tasting than shoveling a scoop of protein powder into the ol  piehole also  you can t really eat this product in public  it literally looks like a big bar of chocolate covered mouse turds  looks like chocolate covered mouse turds,0,1

1312,i tried to like it and i know it s hard to make good gluten free pasta  so i gave them 2 stars for effort  but due to the sticky tacky texture  questionable nutritional value  and high price  as a pasta loving italian american who has been eating all kinds of pasta for over 50 years  i can tell you that if i had to eat gluten free i d rather give up pasta than eat this stuff  i d rather just pour my home made tomato sauce over brown rice  add some veggies  maybe a few shrimp  i know that s more like a spanish dish  but like i said  i d rather give up pasta than have to eat this stuff my full review is below  this review will not show as a verified amazon purchase because i bought mine locally but i include photos above to prove i ve tried it  but if you do choose to buy this and can t get it locally  amazon prime is the way to go  check out amazon prime  http   www amazon com gp prime  for details on how to get amazon prime shipping perks for free  or ask me about it                        cons   tacky  sticky  and way too chewy  it was so chewy it stuck to my teeth  recommend cooking time is 10 minutes but i tried it at 10 minutes and it was uneatable  it was best at 12 minutes   cooked over full flame in a full rolling boil in plenty of water  be sure to use lots of water  unlike regular pasta  when cooking pasta made from rice or other flours you can t really get away with crowding the pot   they claim it has a true pasta like texture  as an italian american from ny who has been eating pasta of all kinds regularly for over 50 years  this isn t like any pasta i ve tried before  home made or store bought  and i don t think it has  true pasta like  texture as they claim  like i said above  sticky  chewy  tacky   it felt like wet cement in my stomach  i m not exaggerating  it made me painfully constipated   since it is not made from whole grain brown rice  it s white  i feel it s not really that healthy for you  it s not advertised as whole grain or brown rice so i wouldn t take away stars due to this  i just don t think people should eat white rice or products made out of white rice if they can get whole grain brown rice instead   it s made from rice  potato  and soy  the potato is white  just like the rice  and soy  well more and more we re finding out too much soy in the diet is not good for you  for centuries soy was mainly used as a seasoning  it s only in modern times food manufacturer s are trying to shove it down our throats in any form they can  i feel the combination of white rice  white starchy potato and questionable soy is just too much for me to recommend it to anyone   being organic and gluten free is the only thing i can see good about this stuff  but as i ve mentioned in some other reviews  poop can be organic and gluten free but that doesn t mean you should eat it  sorry if that sounds crude  but i think it really goes make a good point   it is expensive  but if you have already tried this and like it and can t get it locally  then amazon prime is the way to go  ask me how to get amazon prime free shipping perks  but i don t see it being worth the price                        pros   organic  gluten free  kosher  circle k symbol   produced at a dedicated gluten free facility with no risk of cross contamination with dairy  tree nuts  peanuts  or eggs   the manufacturer is one of a select few in italy who are authorized by the italian ministry of health to produce gluten free pasta  the factory tests for the presence of gluten during each production cycle  independent testing is also done at a laboratory in the united states on each lot before the products are distributed in this country   the actual taste is a little like regular pasta  but i m being generous saying this since the texture was so bad i couldn t finish more than a few fork fulls                        ingredients   same as all of their pastas organic rice flour  organic rice starch  organic potato starch  organic soy flour  and water is used                        company information euro usa trading co   inc   importers of bionaturae 5 tyler drivepo box 98north franklin  connecticut 06254phone  860  642 6996fax  860  642 6990bionaturae com i give it 2 stars for effort ,0,1

1315,i love korean cold noodles   i always have a least a few pouches of it in my freezer   when i saw the instant version on amazon i just wanted to try it   it would be great to save freezer space if this worked out well   also  i was hoping i could take this to work and have cold noodles for lunch   i followed the directions to the t   the noodles were tough and stuck together   i tried to use more water and heated it up longer the second time  and  that didn t help   i wish they can improve the texture of the noodles so that it s more tender and doesn t stick together so much like mochi   anyways  now i have a whole case of this stuff  and don t know what to do with it  great concept  but can improve,0,1

4133,before you think all the  1 star  people are just nuts  please consider this this cereal was a nice  100 calorie  way to start the morning  while getting some other goodies  vitamins  fiber  along with the high protein   the cereal was a little  bland  by most measures but as you see  this is why most of us liked it   it didn t need sugar   it was great for the nutritional value and we liked it as it is kellogg s decided that it s customer base for this cereal is a bunch of 7 year olds who want sugar stuff   tripling  yes  tripling  the sugar in a cereal to improve it and  make you feel full longer    is really not an improvement   and  oh yes  lowering the fiber on its own  is the new version okay  yes   but for those who had sworn by the old recipe  like me   we won t be buying this product again   good riddance  please read before purchasing,0,1

4116,1  does not have usda organic stamp and no organic certification  ys organic farms is the name of the producer 2  does not specify 100  3  does not come in glass jar  organic comes in glass jar this honey deserves       5 stars but the seller zero for misrepresentation  ys farms raw honey is a very good raw honey  very good tasting and i have consumed many jars of the ys farm raw honey but this is not an organic raw honey  it is conventional regardless how good it tastes  it is good enough that i just ordered few jars of this from vitamin shoppe since they were selling it for  5 91 a jar  i consume the organic one as well  the labeling on the jar is specified as y s  eco bee farms  there is no misrepresentation by the ys  it is by the sellers including amazon where they specify as organic just to boost their sells but then after busted they close that chapter or correct the disclaimer  apparently monsanto recently contributed  4 2 million to defeat the ballot measure scheduled for california voters on november 6  2012  proposition 37  along with dupont  bayer  basf  syngenta  and other biotech companies that have each contributed over a million dollars each in their attempt to keep us the consumer in the dark about gmos in our food  ys farms sells 100  organic honey with certification and usda stamp for more money  consumers like lizabeth have chosen to make misleading comments  for lizabeth to discredit usda  organic certification process  as well as ys farms when ys farms sells the organic honey  and then define a non organic honey as  some of the best organic raw honey out there  is appalling  hopefully consumers will get the chance to read the facts and educate themselves accordingly and organic farmers will keep producing organic produce for individuals who actually want organic instead of conventional  regardless of lizabeth s misleading comments and explanations some of the best organic raw honey out there   april 22  2012by lizabeth  bartlesville  ok  united states our very favorite raw honey comes from all about bees in ralston  ne but this honey is a very  very close second  i resorted to bringing in honey from afar when i no longer had access to our favorite  i wanted to buy honey locally and everybody says theirs is  raw  but it isn t unless it is cloudy and a bit gritty like this one is  those are good qualities  i promise    my kids quickly came to enjoy this texture and taste as their favorite  the clear stuff is too cloyingly sweet  anyway  i will be using this as the honey for my family and the 3 pound size here on amazon with prime is a great deal when they can keep it in stock sep 4  2012 6 09 55 pm pdt lizabeth says i appreciate you notifying me of your concerns  however  until they can put a leash on bees  i don t trust any organic labeling for honey  my review is based on reputation  taste  and comparison to my favorite raw honey in addition to many  many years of raw honey consumption  organically certified honey from canada from purportedly pesticide free regions tastes exactly the same to me   i have purchased them both and based my recommendation on my personal opinion and rated it accordingly this is not some of the best raw honey out there since it is a conventional honey not an organic honey  but it is certainly one of the best conventional raw honey out there  shame on consumers and sellers who misrepresent and misguide public for their own selfish and financial gain i consume honey all the time since it has many nutritional benefits for me  i consume after any meal since it helps digestion  i used to consume chocolate years ago but i do not anymore since i consume pure cocoa in my power drinks  i am into many sports and quality honey is the best low calorie energy i can get to boost my immune system and give me healthy energy when i am middle of my mountain biking  hiking  backpacking  surfing  etc  i drink lots of tea and i never use honey instead i use molasses  molasses does not lose its nutrition when heated but any further heat to raw honey kills the quality enzymes and pollens in honey so i only consume honey straight out of the jar with spoon  this is a superfood to me only when it is from quality producers  in a raw stage  and not mixing it with hot drinks in moderation  honey is the best ointment for all my scabs in mountain biking trails  after a day when my wounds are sealed i place raw honey for rejuvenation and it is the best healer of all instead of using neosporin which loosens the scab and removes the scab  leaving scars on my skin  bravo  lies   ,0,1

1351,i bought these noodle bowls based on other reviews and my  limited  previous experience with the brand   as a quick  portable lunch these are good  although the noodle bowls are slightly less easy to deal with because you have to drain the noodles  and in doing so you lose some of the dried bits of the topping mix   the soup bowls are great in that you keep the cooking liquid  which makes for fewer messes   the soup bowls tend to be lower in calories  as well that said  the first time i tasted one of these bowls i was disgusted   with zero additions  the sauce is sweet  syrupy  and hugely reminiscent of soy sauce   the next time i doctored it with a lot of sriracha sauce and it was better  but only slightly   still not edible today i tried something different that actually made it pleasant to eat   i added about one and a half tablespoons of crunchy peanut butter and a cup of leftover sauteed zucchini and onions   the zucchini and onions add heft to the bowl  needed when the whole thing is just a big mess of sticky noodles   the peanut butter took a while to stir into the sauce  but removed the overly sweet  syrupy taste   i can even tell that there actually is a bit of a spice kick to the sauce now of course  all that doctoring makes it much less simple to prepare  so i won t be buying this one again   it s easier and cheaper for me to just make a batch of noodles and vegetables in peanut sauce and portion it into lunch sized servings  need a lot of doctoring,0,1
1352, i have very thick coarse healthy never dyed hair i bought this product at my local drug store  there were many types to choose  so i got the root volumizing shampoo and cond   the scent is ok  nothing special   the first use cleansed my hair well  lathered thick  and left it smooth and sleek with a nice amount of volume   the second use was just fine  same results   this morning i noticed my hair was full of flakes  thick flakes   the flakes were hard and stuck near the roots of my hair shafts  they were all over my head  i don t know if this is a normal part of the cleansing or detoxifying of the scalp   but i have never had issues with flakes i took a shower right away after trying unsuccessfully to pull the hard pieces out  like a monkey picking lice happily most all of the pieces dissolved out  i went to the store later feeling self conscious  that the flakes was showing or more would come back  i am going to continue using this for 7  10 washes because i feel this is a  normal  part of the process  but if these flakes continue   i will stop  update   i finished the bottle and got another one   i haven t seen any more freak flakes   the product is still so so   i dont love it  but dont hate it  it is fairly affordable  but you get a small bottle  so i think i will be buying panteen next   good luck on this miricle product   lol used 3 4 times now   a heads up to those who can t be caught dead with flakes ,0,1
