# Sentiment_analysis_Amazon_finefoods

This is the first big project that I worked on while learning ML.<br>
Dataset taken from kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews]<br>
The dataset has been explained in the Data Analysis file.<br>
__Note:__ To do this project, [http://blog.nycdatascience.com/student-works/amazon-fine-foods-visualization/] was used as a reference. A special thanks to Rob Castello.
<br><br>**PS:**I'm trying to find why three star reviews have the most review length.

Hypothesis:
* People tend to give equal amount of pros and cons of a product, in 3 star reviews. This is the reason to that 3 star reviews are the longest.
