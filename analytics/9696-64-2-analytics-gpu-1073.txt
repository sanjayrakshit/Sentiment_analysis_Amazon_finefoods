not as good as the first time the first time i purchased one of these packs , i got a really nice variety of coffees . the second time , i got virtually no " regular " coffee . . . just a ton of flavored coffee and unusual flavors at that . 
=================
would buy again - - with caveats ah , the sensual taste of black truffles . this salt includes generous bits of black summer truffles , not winter truffles , but that's good enough for me . at least you know that you're getting actual truffle substance , in contrast to truffle oil , which often contains synthetic compounds ( truffle " essence " ) . i received this package last night and already sprinkled this truffle salt on mashed potatoes and on a veggie burger . i'm looking forward to adding this to my scrambled eggs every morning and creating a blend with unsalted butter . as far as the truffle salt itself goes , i only wish that this were available at an even higher concentration than 10 % . the main problem is the packaging . the lid does not keep in the beautiful aroma of truffles - - i don't mind the smell in the kitchen , but all that wonderful flavor won't end up in the food . i've portioned out some in a camping ( screwtop ) salt shaker so that i can keep the main stash in a ziploc bag . but to reiterate , the lid itself is really a bad packaging job . in fact , the jar was open when it arrived ! i'm not sure whether to blame the manufacturer or amazon , but this meant the truffle salt spilled all over the inside of bubble wrap and the cardboard box . i recovered most , feeling somewhat pathetic about the effort , but this is expensive stuff and easily 10 % to 20 % of the product got lost in transit . i guess that tells you how good the stuff is . 
=================
tastes great , price is ridiculous these taste good , however i get them at about half the price at a local organic store . i am surprised they charge so much on amazon .

candy great , packaging and amazon's handling abysmal we are scheduled to receive a bag of raspberry gummis once a month . today we received the candy for the second time with the bag slit and the candy throughout the box . the box contained other items . it was evident that whoever packed the box knew the bag was slit and tried to conceal it by putting it upside down and thus guaranteeing that all the candy was contaminated .

smaller size received when i placed my order for this tea , size was listed as 227 grams . what i received was the smaller 120 gram size . i see now that the size has been removed from the item description . i'm sure the tea itself is fine , it is sealed and arrived in timely fashion . i purchased two of these for hostess gifts , and now have to supplement with something extra because of the smaller size . 
=================
you gotta like fish what can i say , it tastes like fish . like really fishy fish . texture is ok , salty , but not overly salty , but it is what it is , fish eggs .

works ? the " trap " didn't catch any moths . . . must not be any to catch . that's good news , but even if it had trapped a moth the damage would have been done by the larvae . this trap just alerts one to the moths .

this food can be found for much , much less at petco i can not believe what a scam this is ? this is expensive high quality food however it can be purchased for half the price or more at local pet centers like petco , which is not inexpensive retail in my opinion . please beware and shop around !

1 ingredient - no added sugar or preservatives ! i first tried coconut water in a can w / a spanish label . that particular brand was very tasty . . . and i knew it was too good to be true ! this water doesn't compare . it's much more pure and you can clearly tell the difference . 
=================
growing rapidly and there were absolutely no instructions included specifically for the ginkgo bonsai - most importantly when and how to prune , how large it will get , etc . none of these questions can be found in books either . currently , it is 28 " tall which i consider rather tall for a bonsai i've had for less than 1 month but i don't know what to expect . the pot is pretty . 
=================
little too sweet for me i love coconut water . i've tried a lot of them . one , zico , vita coco , amy & brian etc . . this one imo is too sweet for me . the version with the coconut pulp is a little less sweet . i liked that one better . 
=================
seems all right . one of our cats thinks this tuna is the best thing ever and tries to guard it , which is something i've never seen her do with food before . our other cat wasn't initially very interested in the treats and then threw up after she had some of one , but she'd been throwing up her regular food too , so i can't really blame the treats . the tuna falls apart easily and is pretty messy - - these aren't a dehydrated stick type of thing , which makes them seem more like a meal than a treat to me . maybe , though , they don't contain enough nutrients to be the main part of a healthy cat's diet . so one of our cats would give the treats five stars , and the other would probably give them two . 
=================
it's ok coffee , but it doesn't go very far . . . as others have commented , it's decent coffee . a bit light tasting , but a decentchange from time to time . my only real gripe is that you only get 5 or so pots of coffee per can ( i generally make a full standard size pot when i brew coffee ) . sort of makes this " joe " a little pricy unless you catch it for a decent sale price . 
=================
cheaper to buy direct from company the honey is delicious . i just wanted to let people know they can go to the actual producers website and get this same package for $ 20 . 00 and i got free shipping when i ordered . there are also more choices for different honeys . [ . . . ] nothing against amazon but i got a better deal there for this purchase . 
=================
not the real one again : - ( of course , the problem that we have , my wife and i , is the fact that we are belgians and lived the first 25 years of our lifes in liege ( born and raised ) . so when i get pearl sugar online for our liege waffles , like this one , pretending to be " belgian pearl sugar " ( it's written on the box ! ) , we can only be disappointed . i guess it's good enough for those who never been in belgium or those who just passed by there . . . those swedish made pearl sugar - at least they are not the rocky sugar - are too big , melt during cooking , give a taste of caramel instead , making the waffle chewy . oh well . . . i'm sure one day we'll find the real belgian pearl sugar somewhere online . . . 
=================
beware : look at best before date before using ! i love the product , but the stock the amazon sent me was about 8 months passed the best before date stamped on the box . make sure that your product is fresh and safe for consumption by verifying the best before date !

not your mother's maxwell house it's not yuban , but it's not bad . it's also not the maxwell house that became famous as the watery church basement coffee of days gone by . it's got a robust flavor that surprised me , and no after taste to ruin it . better than average brew for a rock bottom price . it's just what american needs right now - - a decent cup of coffee that's not a budget - buster . bravo , maxwell house .

it works ! this sticky trap is way smaller than i have in mind but it really traps small insects in the garden . i was having some gnat problems and some other small garden insects that's why i purchased this . the next day after i put it a little under the leaves , i found a lot of insects trapped in it . there was even a moth , which was also another problem i had . when i put a new one again i didn't realized that it would be raining that night and it got wet . when i checked it though it was still really sticky enough to trap some more insects later so i didn't changed it . i didn't have to change each and everyone of it until full . i would suggest to put it in a place where butterflies won't get to it as the color seems to attract them too .

pignoli pine nuts are the edible seeds of pines , the family pinaceae , genus pinus ) . about 20 species of pine produce seeds large enough to be worth harvesting ; in other pines the seeds are also edible , but are too small to be of great value as a human food . the woodstock farms organic pine nuts are some of the best i have used and eaten . i always saute then in either olive oil or butter , then mix them in recipes or with rice and couscous . they give a delectable flavor , and add a great deal to any food . ''pine nuts have been eaten in europe and asia since the paleolithic period . they are frequently added to meat , fish , salads and vegetable dishes or baked into bread . in italian they are called pinoli ( in the u . s . they are often called " pignoli " but in italy " pignolo " is actually a word far more commonly used to describe a fussy , overly fastidious or extremely meticulous person ) [ 10 ] and are an essential component of italian pesto sauce . pignoli cookies , an italian american specialty confection ( in italy these would be called " biscotti ai pinoli " ) , are made of almond flour formed into a dough similar to that of a macaroon and then topped with pine nuts . in spain , a sweet is made of small marzipan balls covered with pine nuts , painted with egg and lightly cooked . pine nuts are also featured in the salade landaise of southwestern france . pine nut coffee , known as pi & ntilde ; & oacute ; n ( spanish for pine nut ) , is a speciality found in the southwest united states , especially new mexico , and is typically a dark roast coffee having a deep , nutty flavour ; roasted and lightly salted pine nuts can often be found sold on the side of the road in cities across new mexico to be used for this purpose , as well as a snack . the nevada , or great basin , pine nut has a sweet fruity flavor and is relished for its large size , sweet flavor and ease of peeling .

great service - - i made a mistake earlier last week i gave candy mafia a 1 review . my order should have arrived by the 2nd of august but on the 4th it had not . i had checked with my apartment manager several times before the 2nd of autust , and after , to no avail . today i went in to the mailroom with the manager and there the package was . it was mailed in plenty of time to reach me by the 2nd of august . it was to candy mafia but others that delayed my receipt of my order . my apologies to candy mafia . flo

gerber 2nd foods chicken and gravy my baby is ready for some new foods in her diet so i decided to give gerber 2nd foods a try . maybe i don't really understand how each is defined but gerber 2nds is vastly different from the other brands of 2nd baby foods that we have tried . the other brands seem to be similar in consistency . there is really no difference in the consistency of gerber 1sts and 2nds . the difference is that 2nds includes turkey , chicken and beef and 1sts are all fruits and veggies . my baby did not find gerber 2nds appetizing . the color and odor of the chicken is also nothing like actual chicken . i placed the lid back on the jar and refrigerated the jar since i was hoping to try it with her for another meal . the next day i got the gerber 2nds jar from the fridge and reheated it . when it was reheated the food was so runny that she could have drunk it from a bottle . the consistency does not keep from one day to the next . if you're looking for a baby food with chicken , turkey , or beef then i would recommend that you try beech nut stage 1 . my baby loved the beech nut turkey , chicken , and beef . the only problem is that the major grocery stores in my area do not sell beech nut . next trip that i make i plan to stock up on the beech nut !

find other options i am on a gluten - free diet , and generally i like glutino brand foods . however , these breakfast bars are truly horrible . i even passed them out to 4 other co - workers who after a few seconds of chewing spit them out . if this is my only option for a breakfast bar , then i will just have to find something else to eat . yuck ! 
=================
just what i was looking for ! my 5 month old is teething and putting everything in her mouth . she is simultaneously showing interest in food . i was looking for something that would satisfy all of her needs and this is it . although this is made in china , i felt confident about buying it because it is organic . the crackers are crisp and textured so they provide teething relief . however , once they get really wet they dissolve , so there's no choking risk ! this plus is also a minus because if your baby is messy and gets this everywhere , clean up before they dry because they dry like cement chips ! 
=================
cost vs caution dog owners beware ! although most dogs like these treats ( and they are a good price for the amount you get ) , please use caution . smokehouse , a chinese exporter , was involved in the massive contaminated treat and food recalls last year . if you can't afford the healthier and safer free range treats ( such as lamb ears , kneecaps , tendons , etc ) , you can instead find some great recipes to make your own dog snacks . or buy a kong and shove some doggie snacks in it , or smear a dab of natural peanut butter in it . . . it will keep your dog busy and is good brain stimulation . if you absolutely must buy these smokehouse treats , be sure to check the container for bugs . the last one i saw had some of the most disgusting gray beetle - looking bugs crawling into and around the treats in the jar . also , keep your empty container ( or at least the label ) for a couple months in case your dog does get sick .

catches more than fleas i first started using the victor ultimate flea trap when i lived in california because we had a problem with sand fleas coming in our back patio screen door . we also didn't want to use any pesticides , since we had four small house pets . when we moved to michigan , we continued using the traps because our child was born , and we felt even more strongly about avoiding pesticides . although we did not have a flea problem , the traps have caught several types of spiders , the occasional house fly , a few random creepy crawlies , and even a hornet ! basically , they seem to trap anything attracted to the light / heat . we keep them tucked away , out of sight ( ex : in a back corner of our furnace room , under furniture ) , and in places where the pets can't get too curious - - getting a refill stuck to your skin ( or dog fur ) is the absolute worse . all in all , i think we've been using these traps for nearly ten years now . the bulbs can be replaced with regular night light bulbs or the new led bulbs . 
=================
baker's yeast as far as i am concerned , bulk is the only way to buy yeast . these little packets and tiny jars are ridiculously priced for what you are getting , and beside that most people arent using enough yeast in their baking either . i use yeast for everything from bread to pancakes to corn bread . i use more than most people do . unlike baking powder and soda , yeast is actually nutritional ( as long as it is cooked , never eat it uncooked ) . yeast adds a nice flavor and aroma not found in these 'powders' . i don't know where some of the common practices for using yeast came from , but i've found that you don't need to let things rise two or three times unless , that is , you are looking for a way to pass time . also like in pancakes , just mix up the batter and throw it on the griddle , it rises for me . but don't be so stingy with the yeast . yeast is not some rare thing that needs to be conserved , actually it is cheaply made , yet yeast boasts rather high nutritional value . i may be biased , i rarely if ever bake with white flour , i use whole wheat , corm meal or perhaps rye , mostly whole wheat . i use egg in my dough , batter etc . , rather than the added white flour for gluten . again the egg adds flavor , nutrition and rise power without damaging the texture or character of the whole wheat or cornmeal product . red star is offering a great deal here , and the price is right . 
=================
awesome i make a pretty simple curry : chicken , veggies ( red bell pepper and a yellow onion ) m coconut milk , red curry paste , curry powder , and fish and soy sauce . when i first started making the curry , i used the thai kitchen coconut milk and red curry paste you can pick up at any grocery store . it was always pretty good , and the main thing that prompted me to start looking for other curry paste was the $ $ of a jar that lasted only 3 servings . we found an asian market next to a vietnamese place we frequent . i went hunting for red curry paste and came across this . even cheaper than amazon at $ 4 a jar for about 3x as much as the little thai kitchen ones ! i have to say this paste ( plus a higher quality coconut milk ) has taken my curry to a new level . comparing the ingredients to the thai kitchen paste , the only difference seems to be the mae ploy has shrimp . the flavor is amazing , not to mention it has a spicy kick that the other one lacks . when i first used this after the small jar i almost choked at the spice , mostly because i just wasn't prepared for it ! after 5 servings of curry the jar is only half gone . the only recommendation i would make is to look for this at your local asian market - seems to be twice as expensive here on amazon !

nutritious but barely edible these are good in terms of protein and fiber . they are horrid in terms of taste - - coated with a sickly sweet icing and excessively flavored .

don't pay this shipping fee ! ! a very high quality , palatable food . one of the * only * dry dog foods that all of my chis will eat . the shipping charge on this stuff is outrageous - almost as much as the food itself . go to www . artemiscompany . com and enter your zip code . they locate a store near you where you can buy it . most pet food stores charge about $ 50 for a 33 lb . bag . save the $ 36 shipping fee for something else . . . toys and treats , perhaps . or donate what you saved to your local rescue organization or shelter . if you can't buy it near you , other vendors ship it for about half what these guys charge .

yummy - but super high sodium . . . i found this product on amazon , and i love it . i did order it from amazon , they had a great price on a pack of six . please note that the cheese flavor isn't very strong . i usually make sandwiches with regular spam , mayo , lettuce , and a slice of yellow american cheese . after this came in , i made the same sandwich , minus the slice of cheese , since this spam had cheese already mixed in . i could taste the cheese , however , the cheese flavor was not as strong as the sandwich with regular spam and a slice of american . * * * warning * * * spam is famous for being high in sodium - the reason it keeps so long . i received my delivery yesterday ( october 28th , 2011 ) and the best by date was some time in 2014 ( don't remember what month ) . regular spam has 730mg of sodium per 85 grams ( 3 ounces ) , or roughly 243mg of sodium per ounce . spam with cheese ( according to the label ) has 720mg of sodium per 2 ounces , or 360mg per ounce . that's 50 % more sodium than regular spam . that is a huge jump for something that is famous for being high in sodium . this is definitely something to consider if you have high blood pressure , like i do . if your blood pressure is in check , and you like spam , give this product a try . it is tasty . : ) 
=================
great in theory , not in practice there is a reason orville made it big . . . big kernels are easy and fun to eat . small lady finger kernels aren't . the popcorn tastes great , pops good , and i don't get any husks in my teeth . the problem is that because the kernels are so small it is almost a chore to eat . 
=================
still has bpas i bought this because of the dire reports about how unsafe canned tomato products are - something called bpa on the can interiors is leached into the tomatoes because of their high acidity . after i saw that the tubes were metal i emailed amore to ask about bpa . i give them much credit for repsonding but it turns out these tubes also have bpa so they are no safer than the cans . i will say this tomato paste tastes better ( but not way better ) than what i get in cans but i don't think it's worth the extra cost . i get three small cans for a buck at dollar general and theirs has no added salt which to me makes the dg brand a smarter choice . if the amore was organic then i'd say it was worth the cost but it isn't . 
=================
biscotti more like babies' teething biscuits after reading the other 2 reviews , i bought the pack of 4 cranberry orange no sugar biscotti , but they weren't at all what i was expecting - not crisp and light as most others are , but thick and like the biscuits my children used to teethe on ! ! yes , the taste is good , but certainly one can make a regular biscotti tasty , crispy and still omit the sugar . it takes a looong dunking to get these soft . i'll go with nonni's biscotti any day from now on .

typical gf taste like too many gf products these are drowning in salt to drown out the bland rice flour flavor . i discovered glutino crackers over the holidays and recommend them as the best gluten free cracker i've tried . my favorite is the glutino cheese cracker with just a hint of cheese flavor that compliments rather than overwhelms the flavor of the spreads , cheese etc . spread on top . a great find for holiday ! 
=================
fan of plain puffins i will order puffins because i have tried it and it is only at target here . please do not discontinue the plain . i don't like fruit , honey , peanutbutter , cinnanamon or other flavored cereal , but like puffs . i have trouble with alot of cereal because of dentures . for years and years i got quaker corn bran but they added cinnamon and i don't like it . of , course , i want fiber , low sugar , calories . thank you

didn't last long my pup and i really enjoyed this in the beginning . she very quickly learned how to hold the rope with one paw and tip the bottle with the other to get food out . we were starting to learn some other things ( adding balls inside to change how the food fell out , etc ) . screwing the cap on was always difficult , with it needing to be lined up exactly right . soon , however , the threads broke off the bottle so that we could no longer screw the " cap " on . now it is useless .

the price is the problem the coffee flavor is awesome , one of my all - time favorites - but the price ? almost $ 40 for the 2 - pack , plus shipping ? c'mon gimme a break ! order direct from green mountain coffee roasters ( the people who make it ) for $ 26 for the 2 of them ( $ 13 each ) plus shipping . whoever priced this so high must be smoking something !

product is fine , but the price is more than at the grocery store ! i can get this at my local grocery store for $ 2 . 69 per can ( $ 32 . 28 for 12 ) . 
=================
somewhat diappointed i used to get this at the 7 - 11 for five cents each so it brought back memories from my childhood . when i was little , it came in all flavors . this package was the same product and as good as i remembered , but it waslike a multi row of flavors for each bar . when i was little , each bar was a seperate flavor
=================
pleasantly surprised , should have been the original pretzel - type recipe ! pleasantly surprised , should have been the original pretzel - type recipe ! . . . but , am sure technology is the only way they could make a pretzel - type snack so light and crispy , not hard and sawdusty at all ! i usually can't eat more than a few pretzels , but these i can probably munch at least ten . the dough is rolled with random air pockets somehow inside and if there weren't or aren't it's still airy - light and crispy , unexplainable . . . well , that's the texture , the taste is light and delightfully tasty . these would be terrific if i had some dip , but on there own they are great , but not terrific . they don't seem to fall apart into little pieces either , pretty stable when you bite it . ir looka about 3 inches long . . . hey , i believe they were rolled up on a piece of metal , then cooked . . . why they have a hole throughout the center that is not punched , but flaky layers around it . some bites taste buttery , some multi - grainy , all great . . . i love a snack that every single spec tastes the same . it's not often an actual five star pretzel - small breadstick at a reasonable price with a hefty portion . . . . they are a lot lighter than pretzels , so more volume . 
=================
yum ? was not prepared for the flavor of this product , however , it took little to no time at all to enjoy each and every drop !

customize for best taste ! some claimed it was bad b / c of the sucralose taste . i am not a fan of splenda so i almost didn't try . saw it at the store and customized it by hitting the manual button b / f the milk was done and it tasted much better ! ! i figured out it wasn't the splenda so much as it was watered down . try it ! 
=================
keeps the dog busy for a half an hour whenever i give my dogs something to chew on i hope it keeps them busy for a while and tire them out . these fun bites are too big for my chihuahua ( it is suggested for dogs over six pounds ) , but for my medium sized mix breed , it would take her about a half an hour to finish them off . i really cannot comment on the " digestive support " that the fun bites advertise but she does not seem any different as to the way then before she ate these . what is annoying about this product is the labeling as they have important data and warning on the bottom of the package making it very hard to read it without ripping or cutting it . if it is important , how about putting the warning wear someone can actually read it ? 
=================
corn chex is not gluten - free general mills corn chex ingredients on this site lists " barley malt extract " , which means that this product is not gluten free . be careful . a version of rice chex , however , has just been made available where the barley malt ingredient has been replaced with molasses . thank you general mills ! as always , be sure to read the ingredients on every item you buy , each and every time !

tuna soup i bought a bunch of these from walgreens just to find that none of the cans had chunks of tuna in them . they should probably re - label this product to " tuna soup " since this is really what this is . the pieces are so tiny that they literally ooze out of the can as you drain the water out of it . plus who in their right mind would name a brand of canned tuna 'chicken of the sea' ?

needs proper handling unbrewed leaves had a hay smell , i tried it anyway , brewing like black tea . awful ! then , i researched tea and found different varieties require different methods of brewing . since there are few variables , i decided to expirement before tossing this out . tried sun tea , better , but with an off taste . then , i tried hot [ not boiling ] water for a short time . perfect ! brewed exactly right , this is yummie . 
=================
should have tried one first i bought these through another site . the picture of the bag composting was very convincing , but now that i've used them i can say that they don't compost per statement . i have used these bags to collect food scraps to take over to my compost bin . over a year later they are still there . i had my husband cut an opening of our compost bin thinking i could get some finished compost out on the very bottom . the plastic tears easier now but still in one piece , was thinking it wouldn't be identifiable . update i found info regarding " compostable " at plasticsindustry . org and here's a paragraph of what " compostable " means : " in order to breakdown , compostable bags must be sent to an industrial composting facility , not backyard piles or municipal composting centers . there are very few of these facilities in the u . s . and where these facilities are not available , compostable bags will sit in landfills because theycan't be recycled . " shocking or what ? ! 
=================
where is product made ? i have scoured the internet trying to find the source of the produce used in this product and have not been able to locate any information on production . there is only information regarding its new york city base , but nothing regarding where the food is grown , packaged and / or whether it is imported . though it is " certified organic " i will discontinue use of the product until i have answers to the above .

useful ? i bought the smoother because i thought i needed one to make my daughters birthday cake , honestly i think i could have done the same thing with my hand . really if the cake was smooth , you could do it close to smooth . the cost is small enough where if you think you need one get one - but i'm not sure i would repurchase in the future if it broke or i lost it . quality is that it is very thick and seems sturdy . . . just again not sure that i would ever really need one .

great product but questionable product shipped from amazon i love india tree popcorn and eat is all the time . however , this item arrived without shrink wrap or a factory seal . how do i know it wasn't tampered with ? i tossed it rather than take a chance .

more cookies than nutrition the name of these " nutri - grain cereal bars " might lead one to believe they have some whole grain nutritional value . but when you read the packaging the only nutrition comes additives . there is no fiber to speak of and they are loaded with high fructose corn syrup . i use them when my blood sugar drops too low much as i would a piece of candy . these travel pretty well and do give you a bit of volume so you don't feel hungry but they are far from being a healthy food choice .

i wish they were hotter . like many other mass market items with habenero in the name ( looking at you doritos ) these are not as hot as they should be . good for people who feel that taco bell hot sauce is hot , but not for true fans of habenero peppers . 
=================
if you like chewy , gritty , bitter cookies , then these are for you ! i'm not a huge cookie fan . i like my desserts fruity , cheesy or frozen with chocolate fudge on top , the one exception is ginger snaps . i like them even when i'm not in the mood for something cookie'ish , i like them with tea , i like them with coffee , i like them with pepper jack cheese ( everything goes with pepper jack ) . also because they usually aren't terribly sweet and when i go to the trouble of baking them , they seem to last longer than other cookies ( i mean they still taste good the next day , not that i can resist eating them all straight from the baking sheet ) . but these ginger snaps are not right . they are chewy and gritty . stale but burnt in places . i know , it sounds like a manufacturing problem and i thought perhaps the unburnt , not stale ones would be okay if they were rebaked . nope . i picked through the bag to find the snaps that weren't burnt , i put them in the oven to 're - crisp' at a low temp ( 250f ) for about five minutes , in the end they still tasted bitter , gitty , stale and overly sweet . the price is right at around $ 3 a bag , but i think you'd be better off buying an old tried and true brand , such as nabisco ginger snaps ( sweetish , super crispy , reliably cooked for an even crisp texture ) or anna's ginger thins , my new favorite store brand of ginger snaps ( they are wafer thin , spicy and go well with ice cream ) . 
=================
love the taste but the seals were broken on almost all of them not sure why ! i have always loved the taste of these spread but i am a bit disappointed in the seals being broken along the lid on 4 out of 5 jars , as if the jar's plastic lid is too sharp and cuts into the foil seal . anyway , i hope it's safe for me to eat it still . 
=================
organically incorrect considering the extra that one pays for organic products , this product did not deliver . for one thing it did not pass my smell or taste tests . thyme is a fantastic herb , and i expected the organic to be even more robust than non - organic . i understand that it is dried for packaging , but even so , i did not expect to have to " struggle " so much to extract it's aroma or develop its flavor profile in my dishes . non - chef that i am , i have been around the kitchen long enough to know what i am working with when it comes to my favorite herbs and spices . this brand does not measure up .

eliminating aspartame in all forms how did something like aspartame ever make it into our food supply ? in the book " prescription for nutritional healing , " by james and phyllis balch , aspartame is listed under the category of " chemical poison . " uh , yeah . it's made up of three chemicals : aspartic acid , phenylalanine , and methanol . also noted for causing migraines so , as a sufferer , i began eliminating everything containing it from my refrigerator and shelves . fortunately that wasn't much but i do chew a lot of gum and have since i quit smoking 10 years ago . amazon to the rescue ! the epic xylitol sweetened gum not only tastes great and has a nice consistency , it's got the added benefit of leaving my teeth feeling super clean and smooth .

very fun , but dangerous ! wow ! this little bottle of hot sauce packs a punch . i first bought this product when i was in college and boy oh boy it was fun . this is really hot ! hot ! hot ! hot ! here's what you don't want to do : warning ! do not attempt to try this at home . read the warning label on the bottle . do not : 1 . heat up a frying pan in your friend boot's house and drop a little " da bomb " hot sauce in the pan ! all of the guests will flee from the house as if mustard gas was just released . 2 . put " da bomb " hot sauce in somone's lotion , toothbrush , or phone receiver as it spreads like wild fire . it's worse when it gets close to your eyes . 3 . throw a house party and dare party - goers to try " da bomb " hot suace on the end of toothpick , and when he needs something to take the hot away , hand him a piece of bread with more " da bomb " hot sauce on it . your party will be over quick . 4 . sneakily drop " da bomb " hot sauce on your friends pizza when he walks away from the room . after his first bite , he will look directly at you with anger ! again , these are tales from the " underside " . fools from the underside can do some crazy things when they are youngsters . . . do not attempt these stories , as i am not liable for your actions . oh yeah . . . can i get my jeans back daaveed ?

overpriced i thought that this was a decent price when i ordered it . two days later i went to a foodstore which had not carried it and found that they had begun stocking the litter for $ 7 . 98 . i like this product ( and so does my fussy cat ) , but feel that i have been ripped off .

too expensive here i like the product , but it's way too expensive on amazon . keurig's website has a much better deal on these , and they have a club discount . i buy from amazon all the time and would like to see them start a club for k - cups . more and more keurigs are being sold , and the demand is only going to increase .

coffee is great delivery horrible between my wife and myself we during at least 6 cappuccino's per day . i have ordered coffee bean direct several times and the product is great . amazon has gone to fedex for shipping and they are the worst . what used to take one day with ups now takes 4 days with fedex . this is the last time i buy this from amazon ! !

i like coffee not by the gallon though ! totally blown away when i received 4 cellophane packages of maxwell house freeze dried coffee . the bags aren't resealable and the directions are for 2 to 4 gallon urns . . . obviously a restaurant supply item . all i can do is shake my head , nothing indicates it as that type of product . the description indicates the coffee is packaged in maxwell house glass jars to preserve the flavor .

sodium benzoate is dangerous - it's in ez - sweetz i was disappointed to find out ez - sweet uses sodium benzoate as one of it's preservatives . this ingredient , when combined with ascorbic acid ( vitamin c ) creates benzene which is carcinogenic ( cancer causing ) . i used to use splenda or generic sucralose packets , but they made a mess on the counter , took up too much room in our pantry when purchased in bulk , and took up alot of space near the coffee maker when compared with concentrated sweeteners . ez sweet would be the easy alternative if it weren't toxic . i had to find a better option . i find that the only super easy way around using ez sweet but also save on space / mess is to use the splenda mini tablets . they are much more expensive than the packets and take time to dissolve , so i've recently found another option . i can purchase 1 oz of pure sucralose powder form from the splendex site and mix it with 3 oz of water ( plus a natural preservative ) to make the equivalent of 2 , 500 packets of splenda . the cost of the 1oz powder is only $ 24 . 95 . i found that other companies sell sucralose powder but haven't found a supplier who sells just 1oz and will supply me with a 4 oz bottle suitable for dispensing the solution . finding the powder wasn't easy . it is not an option on their home / default web page . i had to go to order products and on the right side was an option for the powder . i'm going to experiment with different natural preservatives ( colloidal silver , gse , natural salts , natural acids ) to keep the solution from becoming contaminated with bacteria or fungus . if you're going to go this route , do some research on natural preservatives and if you find one that works well , please leave a comment to this review .

poisoned product two or three months ago , i subscribed to this company for automatic delivery of their dried chicken " breasts " each month . when this month's order arrived , i allowed my golden retriever to eat one only . within a short time he became severely ill and continued vomiting repeatedly throughout the entire night . i am a retired attorney / judge . i do not become hysterical over every complaint that makes a claim that some product or other can kill your pet . now , i greatly regret my cavalier attitude about this particular item . had my golden been weakened in any other way , i do not believe he would have survived this incident . my on - going purchase of this product despite prior bad press and numerous complaints was foolish . but i trusted that the distributors of the dried chicken " breasts " would monitor this product more closely after the first recall of this product so that no other animals would be harmed . such was clearly not the case . in fact , it appears that the only action the u . s . distributors took after the last recall was to print on each package that the product had come from the united states . closer inspection however reveals that although this product was packaged in the u . s . , it continued to be imported from china . amazon is by far the best retailer on the internet by far . my complaint is not against amazon . but i feel compelled to alert other potential customers regarding the poisoning my dog suffered ( and he did suffer ) . i can imagine other pets who are smaller , older , or in some other way more vulnerable than my golden , would and could actually die if they consumed even the smallest amount of this product . it's true that this was not the case every month . rather it is an intermittent but on - going problem . i cannot emphasize enough how serious this problem is . it is absolutely necessary to eliminate the distribution of this product in the u . s . once and for all . please amazon , end your involvement in this matter .

the bars are fine . this deal is not . i have severe diet restrictions . all you who would like to be thin , i can recommend the ibs diet - - as little fat as possible ( i find i can take no more than 5 grams of fat in a meal ) , no dairy , no nuts , no chocolate , no caffeine , no decaf , limit wheat flour , no red meat , no heavy meals , no empty stomach , and on and on . deviate from the diet restrictions and you will lose weight . eat carefully and you still lose weight . this allows very few options when you eat out or you're on the road . since i work a job which requires a fair amount of travel in a large rural area , finding a 'nutrition bar' or snack food i can eat was a challenge . cliff bars are easy to find in most walmarts , and cost just under a dollar each . they're a little cheaper in case lots - - $ 5 for a box of 6 . i can only eat 2 kinds , and of course they're popular , so i seldom find them in boxes . i searched online and was surprised to see walmart . com offers an assortment of 3 boxes ( 18 bars ) for $ 15 . they add $ 1 . 47 for shipping , but even so , that's a much better price than amazon's offering here . if you like these , or have a lot of kids and family who do , you may want to check out that source .

product - - outstanding ; price - - gouging ! ! we researched cat foods to find the best , and newman's is one of the best . the problem is that i can buy it for ~ $ 9 . 60 for the 3lb bag and ~ $ 13 . 70 for the 4 . 75 . it was not easily found at local stores , but definitely worth the effort . i hope amazon gets a little more realistic in regard to pricing this line

does not work for deer , at least in texas this product did not work at all for me for deer in texas , ( where the deer population is 6 million or so ) . most of the rave reviews are concerning squirrels or rabbits , but my problem was deer . the squirrels and rabbits don't eat that much and i always plant a little extra anyway . the product is called " deer off " , and has a picture of a deer running on it . toward my pea patch , i suppose . i noticed the deer had visited my 60 foot row of purple hull and zipper peas ( about 18 " high and blooming ) , the previous night , and had nibbled a little on one end . i went back to the house and got the miracle bottle that my wife had bought a few months earlier just for this occasion . i sprayed about half a bottle of deer off ( ready to use ) till everything was wet , and the next morning it looked like you ran over it with a lawn mower , and deer tracks were everywhere . the deer absolutely ate the stems and all right to the ground . they ought to sell this stuff to hunters for a lure . so it's off to the grocery store to buy peas . no satisfaction from woodstream customer service either . they have a 30 day limit on refunds . live and learn . terry

good coffee , bad espresso ! these beans are not meant for your espresso machine ! caffe appassionato beans are roasted very dark and are oily just like a french roast . i would not be surprised one bit if this is french roast . i think many americans like dark roasted coffee because they are used to drinking crappy burnt drip coffee that sits on the burners too long . this coffee has absolutely no character what so ever . my opinion is that its way too dark and taste burnt . the espresso shots brewed very unevenly . i pulled a double shot in separate cups on my expobar espresso maker and ended up with one cup having a significant more espresso than the other . the beans were ground very evenly in my gaggia burr grinder at setting 4 just like any other bean i've used for espresso . there was barely any crema ! i will try a coarser ground the next time around just to see if i can pull a more even shot . i prepare several shots per day on my expobar espresso machine , have experimented with numerous varieties of beans over the past 3 years of owning this machine and have always made excellent espresso drinks . unfortunately , this was not the case with caffe appassionato . caffe appassianato espresso roast makes a good cup of coffee in the french press but these beans are the worst for espressso . 4 stars as coffee , 1 star as espresso . if you want to buy espresso beans here on amazon , go with lavazza . they have a $ 17 bag that is very good . i just ordered another bag of lavazza after tasting my first shot of caffe appassionato . don't let all of the 5 star reviews fool you , this is not espresso !

hurry to buy this is so - called " kaki - p " which is a salt peanuts with spicy crackers . one of many japan - original snacks which had been available only in japan until recently . this one is not too salty and a good associate of sake , beer and green tea . kameda is famous for their quality products and received high reputation for neary a half century . its price ( $ 18 for 6 once ) is not expensive for its quality . however , , , recently kameda announced a business tie - up with a korean company ( some of the company's products are prohibited to import in some countries and very likely the us too for hygienic reason ) . hurry to buy as much as possible you can buy before the current safe stocks last . god only knows if kameda can keep high quality of this product after some month later on .

nasty chemical aftertaste i wasn't expecting much from a calorie - free " chocolate " dip . i figured it would taste mostly like artificial sweetener , and so i didn't plan to eat it straight . i sliced up a banana , put a tablespoonful or so of the dip on it , and then topped with with some fat - free whipped topping - - so there were two things i * really * like in the bowl with the dip . i still couldn't finish it . i'm a diabetic , so i have to watch the amount of sweets i eat ; i have a real sweet tooth , so i'm * used * to the flavour of artificial sweeteners and " fake " foods . ( people , i think fat free cool whip is * good stuff * . we're talking " not a gourmet , " here . definitely not a food snob . but i thought that this was nasty . why two stars ? because my housemate * loved * it . he's happily spooning it onto oatmeal , fruit , graham crackers . . . he may be putting it on his hamburgers , for all i know . : ) and if someone else thought it was * that * good , i can't give it one star , even if i personally loathe it .

this milk makes our baby really sick ! ! : ( sorry to give this 1 star . but this milk really makes our baby really sick ! ! : ( , literally ! ! if your baby can take it , i guess it's a good one but for us , we had the worst experience with it . here is our story . my baby had been solely breastfed . after 9 months my wife was running short of her milk . she didn't have enough breastmilk for the baby and he didn't take as much solid food as we would want him to . we gave him similac advance , it was recommended by the hospital . first similac advance liquid , he threw up 9 times within 2 hours after half an hour of feeding . that happened twice . a few days later , we tried similac advance power , he threw up again ! this time 5 times plus serious diarrhea for 5 days . he has lost 5 % of his weight within 2 days . that's really bad . we were desperate . we took him to the hospital twice that week . the doctor though it was stomach flu . however , i didn't quit agree with him . what a coincident that 2 different formula milk feeding incidents would throw my baby off balance . i'm a computer engineer and dealing with solving and debugging problems all the time . i was firm with the doctor that this was not a coincident . i thought it might have something to do with the protein in the formula that my baby couldn't digest . we decided to try lactose free formula ( nutramigen from enflora ) . it smell and taste really awful ( my wife tried it and she gagged . as we thought , my baby rejected to drink it . then i tried good start soy . same story , smell bad but not as bad as nutromigen . my baby also rejected to drink it . now we were really desperate , not enough milk for him and he doesn't like to eat solid food ! ! he would throw up + diarrhea if he gave him normal formula milk . phone call to 4 advise nurses , no luck ! i finally search on the internet and found a lot of similar story to what we experienced ( including this on amazon reviews ) . i decided to give it a final try , crossing our fingers really tight . good start gentle plus is our last hope or my baby would not have any more milk to drink . he's losing weight ! ! and then miracle happened ! ! ! this milk works wonderfully for him . the only complain i would have is that it doesn't smell as good as the normal cow milk - based formula , however , doesn't smell or taste awful like the other two . my baby didn't quite used to the tasted in the beginning and didn't really want to drink it at first . so we tried mixed it with breastmilk for a few days . now he is a happy baby , gaining weight , doesn't throw up and used to the taste of it . my wife and i are now happy again : )

12 - gram monster pod not significantly better i usually buy the 10 - gram , see my review of the coffee quality there . baronet coffee nutty irishman medium roast , 18 - count coffee pods ( pack of 3 ) this time i tried the 12 - gram 16 per box . same excellent coffee . brewed the same way with a cuisinart cup - o - matic , the larger size made very little difference . additionally , so far 2 of the pods were split a little , spilling some of the coffee out . i can't be sure it didn't happen from tearing open the packet ; perhaps you need to be more careful opening the larger pod packets . bottom line for me : the difference between the 12 - gram and the 10 - gram wasn't significant . and the baronet pods that are loose in bags contain only 7 . 77 grams per pod . so i will stick with the 10 - gram 18 - count .

got old fast . i'm a big fan / drinker of green tea and a big fan / drinker of earl grey , but this tea is a little too bergamot - y for my taste . it may be because plain green tea naturally has a weaker taste than black tea , and the bergamot is therefore more evident . after a couple cups of this i decided these two tastes are best on their own .

misleading marketing of a modestly above - mediocre product why can't they promote this product honestly ? it's not a * bad * product . i didn't find it actually objectionable . it's mildly sweet , and has a sort of nondescript , chocolate - simulating flavor . on its own merits , if i were in a really great mood i might even give it four stars in spite of its relative synthetic blandness and the lack of peanut butter or any resemblance to its flavor . they've actually accomplished something fairly worthwhile in creating a frozen dessert with so few calories , and i'd give it some appreciation on that basis . but . . . " ice cream replacement " ? " smooth and creamy " ? it is neither of these , by any estimation . it's an " ice cream replacement " only in the sense that yogurt or pudding or a ham sandwich are - - as things one might eat instead of ice cream . it's objectively not " smooth " , and anyone expecting it to be ( for example , because they read the label ) is going to be highly upset to find that it is instead gritty and grainy , so much so that it actually makes sound when you pass a spoon through it , similar to scooping packed wet sand . it has a mouthfeel more like a poorly - made sherbet ; the ice crystals are large enough that you can almost see them . this doesn't mean it can't be " good " - - snow cones are super gritty with huge ice crystals and they're still well - liked . overall , it was okay . i definitely like that i can eat small amounts of this stuff even on a keto diet . i think they've got a good product idea , and it deserves a slot on the shelf next to the other frozen desserts . but , a note to the arctic zero folks - - celebrate your product and promote it for what it is . why spoil your efforts by lying about what you've made ?

broke in less than an hour . i bought this product to occupy my 13 - month - old mix . she is an aggressive chewer , but the product description led me to believe that this toy was quite tough . when i received it , i was a little disheartened when i saw that the tug was rubber , rather than rope ( as it appears in the picture ) - as she tends to get through rubber toys with very little effort . nevertheless , i decided to try it out , she learned quickly that she could get treats out of it and it occupied her very well for almost an hour . at that point i went to dig it out from under the bed and was dismayed to find that the rubber " pull " was already in pieces . while the bottle still works and seems to keep her interested , i feel like dog toys should have a more indestructible nature than this one does . especially for eleven dollars !

tastes good , but at what cost ? stevia in the raw contains saccharine , which is most commonly found in sweet n' low , which has been linked to bladder cancer . . . " the actual warning reads : " use of this product may be hazardous to your health . this product contains saccharin , which has been determined to cause cancer in laboratory animals . " note that this warning was removed in 2000 by the us congress ( not by the fda ) after heavy lobbying by the saccharin industry . further research was then done on saccharin , because the fda wished to ban saccharin outright but the food companies fought this ( successfully ) . the national cancer institute ran studies in the next 2 years and found that saccharin was indeed connected with bladder cancer . people who drank only 2 cans or more a day of diet soda had an increased risk . " stevia by itself is one of the 'healthiest' low cal sweeteners on the market but when mixed with things like saccharine - i mean you might as well just use sweet n' low . the only pure stevia brand i have found is sweetleaf stevia - it is not as delicious and most certainly has a bit of an aftertaste , but i have gotten used to it since i have a blood sugar problem and can't consume sugar . my advice is that unless you physically cannot handle sugar , a small amount of raw sugar is much better for you than all this artificial crap . just be smart about the stevia bandwagon everyone is jumping on , because pretty much every brand out there is just some other sweetener mixed with stevia and then sold as 'healthy' .

five star dropping to one star my wife and i discovered planters spanish redskin peanuts a number of years ago and since that time there was always a place on our kitchen counter where everyone could share this wonderful treat . recently the 56 - oz can we purchased contained only very light colored peanuts . these were not as well cooked , appeared to have less oil used in the roasting process and therefore the salt normally found evenly distributed mostly migrated to the bottom of the can . worse , a few peanuts were so brittle i first thought they were foreign objects . in an effort to find the good formula we purchased three of the 12 . 5 - ounce size and two of the 56 - ounce size . unfortunately all were the disappointing new version that we dislike . i just concluded a phone call with kraft foods ( 10 - 8 - 12 ) , the parent company of planters . while they did not admit to the product being changed i was told spanish redskin peanuts were discontinued and would soon be out of stock everywhere . kraft offered coupons as a good will gesture for all the planters spanish peanuts we're throwing away , but since the old perfect treat is no more , it's a disappointing resolution . seldom does a commercially manufactured product like this win over both my wife and i . i must say i'm really sad to see it go , especially since the newest , poorly roasted version is not worth stocking up on .

what the heck did they do to the wrappers ? ! ? ! my family has enjoyed these cookies for more than a decade , and at our christmas eve dinner , we brought them out at the usual time , and started with the annual tradition of " flying angels . " for those of you not familiar with these cookies , if you wrap them in a cylinder , and light the top , when the fire reaches the base , the wrapper shoots up in the air . it's actually quite a bit of fun . so imagine our surprise this year when none of the wrappers would fly . we compared old wrappers and new , and something has changed about the wrappers . whether it's wax , weight , or something else , none would fly for us ( and we have an awful lot of people who are experienced with this ) . so , if you're a fan of these cookies , and the fun tradition that's sprung up around them , i caution you , you may not be able to enjoy them this year as you have done in the past .

be careful ! ! ( if amazon later decides to carry this product ) first of all , i decided to stay away from the chicken flavor since i found out just b / c dog treats & food say made in the usa , doesnt mean the chicken farm the company uses is also in the usa . i bought the " real beef & barley flavor " & it's not hard like in bone - hard . it begins to crumbles apart as the dogs chew it which was fine w / me . i gave it 2 stars because it seems to have really healthy ingredients but still havent figured out why it made my dog so sick . the problem was , my 5 yr old dog ( min pin ) carried it around yet refused to eat the bone after sniffing it a few times . i figure he was just being picky because his 2yr old 23 lb son , gordo , ate it ( but got sick later ) . after eating 1 beef bone he wouldnt eat his doggie food the rest of the day & night . less then 4 , 5 hrs , i seen gordo at his water bowl then instantly threw the water up . there was very little traces of the beef bone tho . . until after 1 am . he kept waking me up by scratching my hands to rub his tummy . the minute he broke to go to their doggie pee & poop pads , i rolled over & quickly went back to sleep ! in the morn , my son went to get a pair of clean socks out of the dryer & seen diarreha & pudding poop all over both pads & floor . i realized definitly it came from gordo after checking both dog's butt butts . i cant seem to find any reviews on it but haven't looked at all the consumer sites yet . just wanted to warn other pet owners to be careful . thank god i didnt give gordo 2 bone treats * whew *

it would have been 5 stars but a whole section of the coconut oil was missing from the jar i never write reviews , because i have not had any complaints on any of my products that i have purchased through amazon . i understand that its not just about bad reviews but good ones too , but for me the product is always great unless i am writing a review . thus here i am writing a review today . i must state that if the coconut oil had not been missing an entire section of coconut oil from the right side of the jar , i would be giving this product 5 stars . i love the taste , quality , shipping time etc . , but the missing oil in the right side of the jar ( the oil is solid ) shocked the heck out of me . i would have written something earlier about this , but i just haven't had the time . every time i look in the jar though , it still shocks me . i wondered if it was due to the way the product was packaged . maybe it rolled onto its side and caused the top to be more full and the right side to be empty , however , it wasn't full to the top . also it's solid and i didn't order it during the warm months for it to be liquid and change . so , yes , i feel ripped off . however , i'm using the coconut oil because i do need it and already have it in my possession . i will not be buying my now bi - monthly supply again through this dealer though , unless they decide to make this right .

convenient . it's kool - aid . what can i say ? it's kool - aid with sugar & exactly what i always expect to taste when i drink it . i buy these to send to servicemen overseas . sugar is not an issue . i'm told the water tastes terrible & they crave any kind of flavoring for the water . sand gets into everything so these handy serving size packages are sand free , easy to carry in their packs & the empty package easily carried until they get back to base & throw them away .

too smelly ? dog won't touch it . despite several washings , i can not get rid of the industrial plastic smell on the soft rubber parts of this toy , and our dog ( lab mix ) has absolutley no interest in it , despite favorite treats inside . i can only assume she finds the smell offensive / repellant . if she does ever take an interest in it ( i keep trying ) , i will keep a close eye on the rubber " rope " - seems like something she may chew through fairly quickly .

haribo versions german haribos don't contain artificial flavors and no artificial colors . german haribos are all natural . the turkish ones however taste too sweet and less fruity , and look much more colorful because of artificial colors ( fd & c yellow no . 5 , red no . 40 , blue no . 1 ) and unnatural flavors . when you send a mail to haribo , they reply that the turkish haribos , sold in the us , contain that artificial stuff , so that the gummy bear flavor survives the long shipping by ship . looking at long shelf life duration of even the german haribos that seems like a lie to me . cost cutting and less restrictive us - food regulation seem to be the real reasons . . . hungarian made haribos ( seen in india ) aren't any better btw .

cinnamon water . my mom gave me a box of this a few years ago and i had just recently gotten around to trying it . it was excellent . i bought another box and the second i opened the first packet i could smell that they had changed the recipe . checking the back of the two boxes confirmed it . cinnamon is about all i taste when i drink it , although the aftertaste has a hint of clove . pretty expensive for something that tastes mixed by a child .

not a variety we ordered this for the variety , and made a separate order of just plain chocolate flavored straws . the description of this product doesn't tell enough . what you get is ten packages , each containing five straws at 0 . 21 ounces each . so the value is good , but there is no variety , they are all chocolate . so we are all stocked up on chocolate now ! the product is great , but the two stars are for the misleading description .

my bichon loves halo food , but not this one . . . i was surprised to see the package is small . but since my dog eats the salmon and chicken dry dog food from the halo brand for years , and he loves it , so i was going to give a try for the dog treats . for some reason , he didn't want to eat it at all - probably it doesn't have a strong dog food / chicken smell ? but i'm sure they made it with good ingredients - i can see the oats in the biscuits . i wish they could improve the flavor a bit to attract the dogs more - since i have seen other reviewer having similar comments .

only 12 bags i use biobag dog bags and love them , so i tried the kitchen bags also . the dog bags are sturdy and don't tear at all , but the kitchen bags seem to be made from something else . they don't fit in an average kitchen garbage bin and they also tear extremely easily . if you are using them strictly as compost bags and only putting scraps in them i'm sure they'd do fine , but they shouldn't be used for an average kitchen garbage bag . also , it only contains 12 bags . add the price of shipping and this becomes very expensive for a bag only to be used in a compost pile .

very expensive while i agree that these nuts are quite tasty , the total weight of the eight packs is one pound . thats $ 26 . 00 per pound for cashews ! i can buy fresh - roasted spiced cashews at the local gourmet nut shop for half that and see them roasted right in front of me !

coffee i didn't receive or order french roast . ordered and received columbian . it was ok , prefer a bolder blend . second order was kona blend . want still bolder so maybe i will try french roast next time . love the keurig though .

easy , but kinda of gross looking my son loved these for about a month , so we went through lots of them . they take 20 seconds to fix , but they're very mushy . makes me wonder how healthy they are .

just add a tiny bit . . . wow , this stuff is sweet ! i would only add a tiny bit . it has a distinctive fruit punch ( think kids artificial not actual fruit ) flavor and we didn't notice any extra energy from it . i did let the kids try a sip & my 5 year old thought it was " good & sweet ( this was with very little added ) " but didn't want any more . it has to be refrigerated once opened and is much larger than it's competitor mio ( about 4 times larger ) . that said , i'm not a huge fruit punch fan so if you are this may be what you are looking for .

concerned about mercury content tuna , as is well documented , absorb and store mercury in fat . anything that eats that fat consumes mercury . i wouldn't feed tuna to a child , and i'd recommend any adult to read the literature regarding mercury content in seafood . how can it be safely fed to a cat ? regarding this brand of cat food , it's excellent as long as you feed chicken or turkey .

not recommended - - stale . i thought i'd try this product , as my mom loves crackers and things like the wasa crispbreads . these were disappointing to both my mom and myself . they tasted stale , even though the expiration date was almost a year away . the flavor was somewhat improved by toasting them . they are edible enough , and i won't return them to amazon because i wouldn't want to cause them unnecessary expense , but i won't order them again . note , the packaging is different from the photograph . since i'm stuck with 11 boxes , i plan to take them to class , where hungry classmates will gradually eat them up . just fyi , they are not vegan , for people that need that . i've copied the ingredients list as printed on the box . " ingredients : spelt wheat flour , water , malt , expeller pressed soy bean oil , salt , egg whites , yeast . toppings : sesame seeds , poppy seeds , garlic , caraway seeds , dehydrated onion flakes . " " manufactured for : good groceries company , brooklyn ny , 11231 " they were mailed to amazon in hazleton , pa from " adam gershuny , good groceries company , 44 heller park lane , somerset nj , 08873 - 1206 " i appreciate amazon giving us the opportunity to try different products , but will try to do better next time in choosing which snacks to order .

dont listen to the dont eat agave ppl ! i'm so sick of ppl trying to mislead . i've lost 40lbs over the last year with a few diet changes , no working out , and agave has been one of my changes . people say it is actually bad for you and has a high gi value , always question them ! i went onto the gi site , and this has a value of 10 - 19 ( per 10grams ) , which is low , highs being 70 + . also , not all agave is created equal , meaning , if processed it can ruin the quality and content . so , be careful on who you purchase this from . less processing , the better . 10 grams of sugar has a gi of about 56 . 66610 grams of agave has a gi of about 10 - 19

you're paying for the tin for father's day i presented dear old dad with all moustache - themed gifts ; these candies made the cut . the candy itself is quite off putting . . . as while itty bitty 'staches are adorable , the fact that they're a smokey black / gray color makes the brain think of licorice or , well , anything that isn't fruity . but they're indeed generically fruit - flavored . not too tasty and pretty darn hard . not sure we recieved the freshest batch , but i think had they been more gummy or even passably soft they'd have scored higher on the taste scale . but the fact is you buy this sort of novelty as a stocking stuffer type of gift , or , in my case , just to go with a theme . the tin is well made and dad will probably use it to store some tiny , albeit manly man odds & ends . is it overpriced for what you actually get ? you betcha ! but since they don't sell moustache candy at every corner store , the price is worth the smile . just skip actually eating the candy . . . unless chipping a tooth is kind of your thing or if you're on the 'dark grey food only' diet . and of course , understand it's a small piece and won't feed ( if you're brave ) the entire neighborhood . small 'stache for lots of cash . 4 stars for the novelty tin , 1 star for the contents . if you're dead set on mustache candy and have teeth as mighty as chuck norris , order away !

jilly loved it i have to start out by saying that i don't like it " fancy or gourmet " dog products . dogs will eat just about anything , except for broccoli and carrots with my baby jilly , and to get some item when you are paying mostly for either package design or brand name isn't something i buy into being that stuff impresses me , not her . that being said i did like this product and more importantly jilly loved it . these have the same x shape as a dentastix , so i have to assume it would help getting rid of some plaque buildup , although there are no claims on the package . the cinnamon and spice flavor was potent enough that i could smell it when i opened the package , which i liked , being i knew what she is getting . and even though the flavor might be more for me than for jilly , it sure is an improvement over liver flavors etc . compared to similar products this was harder and took her more time to eat , which i liked . it took her about 8 - 10 minutes and a lot of similar type products she eats in just a few minutes . all that being said , i really did enjoy the product for what it was , but i am not so sure about any weight loss or health benefits . the l - carnitine proudly displayed on the front of the package , right next to the antioxidants came off as something like lycopene does for people . sure it's good for you and you should eat more of it but when you do do you honestly notice a difference in the way you feel ? as to the weight loss aspects , my dog is only about 8 months old and she's normal weight , but a bit husky being she's a lab . she has some small milk dud sized treats that are her absolute favorites that are 3 calories each and a handful would have less calories than this bone , if weight was an issue and jilly prefers a natural bone ( real bone not rawhide ) and it takes her a long time to eat and i can't believe the amount of calories she gets per preserving is more than 92 . basically , for what it is it's a very good product , that being said there are most likely better options out there if you aren't willing to spend money on the nice smell and nice packaging . i'm not sure if i would order it again , but maybe being i like to give her a verity in treats being she eats the same old same old kibble . 4 1 / 2 stars .

mediocre flavor & brew , not starbucks quality ! in 2011 , when starbucks broke away from tassimo bosch over a contractual dispute , i was completely disappointed , and wonderedwhat other options were going to be available , in the meantime , i purchased a warehouse supply of starbuck's coffee & cappuccino andstarted researching a new coffee machine , and then . . . in november , i found out that starbucks was offering the " k - cup " version , for the keurig coffee machines . i ordered and received a brand new b145 officepro model , a supposedly 'heavy - duty' keurig model . . . in january , i started to put the keurig thru it's paces , along side the tassimo , and frankly the tassimo is still superior , in the way that it brews for better flavor , has a faster brewing cycle , and heats the h2o to the optimal temperature , than the keurig , which btw , is / was a lot nosier than the tassimo . in all fairness , this could be a 'technical' problem with the bar code settings on the k - cups . note , that i continued to also use my red tassimo unit , as it is / was the only coffee unit to use the milk creamers , as keurig still does not offer that option , anywhere ! in february , i left on a 3 - week trip , and as i always do , i turned off all the unnecessary electric household appliances . when i returned back in this month of march , i was so pissed to find out that the brand new keurig was totally inoperable ! nada ! zip ! zero ! despite , doing everything that was recommended on forums ( don't go the keurig forums , as they are so worthless ! ) now , i have a large , fancy keurig brick that i am attempting to get a refund for , so stay tuned ! * pike place + colombian + folgers are the different varieties that i tried on the new keurig machine . the colombian was the best of the lot . read my comments , after each bullet item : * features fresh starbucks coffee in an easy - to - brew single - cup ( k - cup ) serving . - not as good as the tassimo , which is about 2 steps below a starbucks coffee house . i often found the keurig " brew " to be a tad watery , not rich & flavorful . * brews in 1 minute or less , so you can grab a cup when you're in a rush . - but , you have to turn the unit on first , so that it will warm up first , before the blue light comes on , indicating that it is ready to start brewing . * medium roast ground coffee - they call it 'medium' , but i think it's more mild ! * smooth & balanced - disagree , balanced with what ? tea ? * rumor of a sale price of only 38 buckaroos at sam's club & costco - i cannot confirm this rumor . * there is now a new rumor that starbucks is going to be offering their consumer coffee machine in the fall ! stay tuned !

not bottled water amazon has a problem . a person can send them info on why they should change product info , but they have idiots working for them who don't understand that they don't need an act of god to change obviously erroneous info . 90 % of the time , they refuse to correct obvious mistakes . what a bunch of jerks . and yes , this is the helstar cd - burning star . . . not bottled water as the heading and item description indicate .

good kit but follow these recommendations i make wine on the side , and at first it took a lot of research and time . if your new at wine making , get this kit but be warned you will need more than just this kit . besides the kit , you will need a glass carboy , plastic fermentor ( plastic bucket ) , glass bottles 25 - 30 , corker ( to insert corks ) and gas release knob ( to vent gas , without getting the fermentor dirty ) . everything else is optional , such as pump ( recommended ) , funnels , thermometer , filters , heat gun ( for shrinking covers ) , etc . also , for a better taste create 5 gallons of the kit instead of 6 ( simply stop adding water at the 5 gallon mark ) . a common word used in the instructions is " must . " its simply the mixture of water , grapes , and yeast . in sum , it will cost roughly $ 80 - 120 for all the equipment ( that can be reused over and over ) and $ 40 for this kit . doing the math , it will cost $ 1 . 50 to $ 3 . 00 a bottle , not bad for table wine .

decent product , but not as advertised i went out of my way to find us based nuts . the page says these are product of us , but the package claimed to contain chinese nuts . 
=================
our dog totally adored this , but destroyed it in about 48 hours we picked up one of these bones at a local pet store last week . our dog picked it out herself ; i held out two different shaped bones for her to sniff to see if she had a preference , and she actually grabbed this one's package out of my hand . she's never shown that much interest in something in the distracting environment of a store , so it came home with us . for two days , it was her constant companion , she absolutely loved this bone . she'd grab the whole thing around the middle and chew it on her back teeth with her head tilted back , so that she was chewing the red part more than the nubs . this might account for it's early demise . . . at the end of the second day i found it on her dog bed in three pieces , including one that was just the right size for an intestinal obstruction , and i quietly made it disappear while she wasn't watching . she's still looking for it two days later , sadly , and i thought about trying another one in the largest size available , but i don't think i want to risk it . we got the wolf - size the first time , and our dog is a 48 lb . boykin spaniel / pit bull mix . she is is a pretty serious chewer - she's the only dog i've ever had chew a nylabone galileo down to a nub that had to be thrown away and replaced - so this might not be a problem for most dogs . 
=================
exceptionally mild flavor ! buy this one for health i purchased another brand sold on amazon , and the taste was strong , unpleasant , possibly rancid . the difference with this brand is that it has been specially processed for mild flavor and the stearines removed so that the product is a clear oil , instead of a semi solid . if you are taking this for health reasons , i highly recommend this . more is explained on their website .

best way to kill moles . like all traps , it must be set correctly . these traps have a much better kill ratio than the other traps . i have one of these , a harpoon trap , and some that you bury in the tunnels . poisons , grub killers , and gasses probably don't work , and you will never have a body to know for sure . trapping is the best method . i've also flooded the tunnels then shot the mole . flooding the tunnels did more damage than the mole did . i've also nailed a couple with a harpoon trap too , but the scissor type is more effective and i rarely have a sprung trap with no mole . the out o sight scissor trap is the best one . people who are giving this bad reviews must not be setting it correctly , i had the same problems until i learned to set them right . do a google or youtube search and learn how to set them right and you will catch them . 1 . keep your grass short to help spot the tunnels . 2 . pick a tunnel and set the trap correctly on that tunnel , stomp all of the other tunnels down flat , not the one your trapping on . 3 . if you haven't caught the mole in 48 hours , the tunnel is abandoned and needs to be relocated . stomp the tunnel down flat and move the trap to a different newer tunnel . i usually catch them overnight

i'm surprised . personally , i do not like coconut at all or anything that has coconut flavors . i've been like that all my life . i'm like the only one in my family that doesn't like coconut . for some reason , i decided to give this a try . i bought the mango flavor to help me with drinking the coconut water and i was surprised . it didn't have the strong coconut flavor that i have tasted in other foods or beverages . i barely even tasted the coconut . if i didn't know this was coconut water with mango , i would have thought it was some other drink , and this is all natural . i've been hearing alot of good things about coconut water . i just hope that it doesn't upset my stomach later on because i've been having digestive issues so i'm keeping my fingers crossed . so now i'm thinking of trying just plain coconut water and see how that turns out .

poor packaging i was excited to find a package of 48 pop tarts for so cheap , until they showed up . when we received the brown box from the ups man my mouth was watering . then i opened the box to find the case of pop tarts just sitting inside the larger box with nothing to keep it from moving around . i grabbed the box of tarts and lifted it only to have the bottom of the colorful box open up and 4 boxes of frosted goodness fell onto the table . before opening the individual box i was a bit leary . yep , not to my surprise the foil wrapper was full of crumbs . we now eat the pop tarts with a spoon . oh well live and learn . 
=================
didn't like the taste and texture i bought these on the strength of the reviews . inside the thin wrapper the texture was mushy , and i didn't like the taste at all . it tastes mostly of beef heart , smoke and spices . i found them inedible . i had several of my friends try them since i didn't want to waste them if someone else could eat them . the first two friends did not like them , but the third did , so they found a home . the free sample of barbeque beef jerky was delicious , and i am going to order some of that . addendum : not long after i wrote the above review , i recieved a telephone call from the company . he said that they stand behind all of their products , and even though i could not return the item since i had given them away , he would send me a replacement of any other jerky . he sent me the barbeque jerky which i had sampled before . with two additional free samples of other flavors , which were also quite good . i have never dealt with such a wonderful concern for their customers as i experienced with this company . i think you can't go wrong buying from them . he said if anyone doesnt like what they get , they will replace it .

scarpetta tomato and artichoke bruschetta topping i first had bruschetta at a house warming . i was stunned by how fantastic it was . this particular product does have a generous amount of artichokes and is very yum , but not quite as good as fresh homemade . goes well with toasty garlic rubbed bread . the container has a tamper - evident seal under the screw - down lid that needs to be fully removed before it is safe for the microwave . even the smallest bit that remains on the edge can spark up and release some nasty smoke that not only smells bad , but can flavor your bruschetta in a bad way .

only catnip my cat will respond to i've bought catnip a couple times before ( even grew some ) for my crazy cocobean but he's ignored it all . thought it was him ( he doesn't like fish flavor either ) . then i saw reviews for this stuff and thought i'd try . . . rather , i'd let him try . well , he loves it . plays like the stoned out cat i was hoping for . wonder what makes this stuff so special ? thought catnip was catnip . guess i was wrong .

believe the reviewers who complain about imminent expiration dates ! i should've paid attention to the reviewers who warned that their coffee arrived shortly before the marked expiration dates on the bags . mine did as well . no way i'll go through the three bags in time . for that reason , and the fact that this coffee tastes no better than what you'd get at your corner gas station , i'm cancelling my subscribe and save order . one other thing i should've checked out : the majority of the five star reviews are the only product the reviewers ever reviewed . must be a community coffee employee incentive plan .

no itching when i use some other deodorants , especially those super scented ones , my arm pits tend to get itchy and irritated . i tried this deodorant specifically because of the non - irritating aloe claim . their claim is accurate , i love this deodorant because it keeps me dry with no irritation . it also smells pretty good , if i want to load up on scents i'll just add some cologne .

too many calories per serving for a cereal that seems to be trading on the suggestion that it is a healthy choice , this product fails . calories and fat are too high for a 3 / 4 cup serving of cereal , and that is because the fat and sugar content are too high . get fiber plus cereal , cinnamon oats crunch , 11 . 5 - ounce boxes ( pack of 3 ) instead . the taste is outstanding and the nutritional components are much better . the calories are less than half of this cereal , fiber is as good , sugar is much lower , and fat is very low . the fiber plus cereal has been an important part of my success in losing 40 pounds in the last 6 months . my wife also changed to fiber plus for breakfast most mornings , and has lost 33 pounds in the same period of time . ( no , the cereal is not responsible for all of our weight loss , but it gets credit for helping us control our calories at breakfast while still getting good nutritional value ) . i can have a bowl of the fiber plus , half a banana , and milk for 40 less calories a bowl than this uncle sam cereal is dry out of the box . 
=================
not my favorite the mariani mixed fruit was not my favorite . we could challenge each other's palate here , but there was a faux - taste that could not be described with words . something was missing ( not sugar ) ? ? ? 
=================
a little difficult to manage i think that this sucralose liquid may not sweeten quite as much as indicated on the package when used for recipes . i'll try increasing the drops a little next time i make my sugarfree cheesecake . also , it's a little difficult to manage counting out the drops to get , say the equivalent of 1 1 / 4 cups of sugar . maybe i'll eventually figure out how to measure it by the measuring spoon instead of drops . it would be nice if they would put larger equivalents on the packaging , rather than leaving it to us to calculate by the equivalent of a teaspoon or tablespoon of sugar . that is , i wish they would say that 1 cup of sugar equals xx teaspoons or parts thereof . it would make using it for recipes a lot simpler . on the positive side , it does sweeten without adding a bunch of liquid or foreign flavors to your recipe . 
=================
tastes good but not enough aroma i like everything except for weak aroma . i don't know why . it just doesn't have nearly as much nice coffee smell as the other ones . aroma is one of the things i enjoy when i make expresso . this is why i gave 4 star . 
=================
i expected a lot more from the newman's own brand . i have tried a couple of products from the newman's own line and , while i didn't necessarily think they were better than their competitors' products of the same type , they definitely held their own . i sadly did not find this to be true with the newman's own organics dark chocolate bar . when it comes to reviewing edible products , i find it helpful to compare and contrast with a similar product from another brand . because i love dove dark chocolate ( though i try many different kinds of dark chocolate ) , i used the dove silky smooth dark chocolate bar as comparison ( though i prefer the dove promise individual bites , it was easier to compare bar to bar ) . the dove dark bar is 33 grams and the serving size is the entire bar . the newman's own organics dark chocolate bar is 64 grams , nearly double the size of the dove bar , and still 1 serving is considered the entire bar . now , i am as much of a chocolate lover as the next person ( probably more , in fact ) , but there is no way i need nor want to eat to consume 64g of chocolate in one sitting ( especially sub - par chocolate ) . in most nutritional areas , especially fat and sat fat , the 33g dove bar and the 64g newman bar are almost equal if you consider that one is double the size of the other . newman's only clear win over the dove bar is on cholesterol , having 0mg even though it is double the size of the dove ( which has 5mg cholesterol ) . for those watching sugar , the smaller dove bar has 17g while big daddy newman has 37g . with the health business out of the way , let's get down to brass tacks - - taste and texture : texture . i am accustomed to the smooth , creamy texture of dove dark chocolate - - i find its mouth feel luxurious . my initial thought on biting into and chewing the newman was waxiness - - quite nasty at first but , once i got it chewed , it had a nicer mouth feel . it is not creamy like dove , but it loses the waxiness once chewed . taste . the only thing particularly pleasant to me about the newman bar was the finish . . . the very last taste as you're swallowing it . that has a deep rich dark chocolate taste and , despite the 37g of sugar in it , is not overly sweet , which is nice . as for dove , the entire process of biting into it , chewing it and swallowing it is enjoyable , so there is no contest . in summary , if you have your heart set on contributing to newman's own because of the good work they do , or you must have an organic chocolate bar , i suppose this will do . but it is not , in my opinion , any competition for any other brand of good dark chocolate i have tried . 
=================
not so much . . . ( review by heather shol ) the shipping and handling went all right , but with trying the tea it really didn't have a taste at all - - none of that " fishy , woodsy " taste , either , so . can't say i like it . i'd say with getting a type of this tea , get organic block form ; much more flavor ! 
=================
not all that good while saving money is a key factor in purchasing this , i am basing my review on the taste of the product . overall , the coffee has a powdery taste as compared to the pre - packaged k - cups . it does not compare to the tully pre - packaged french roast that i am used to drinking . as noted by other reviewers , i don't know the eco friendliness of the packaging , since you are trading out a small plastic cup for a small plastic pouch . overall , a two star for the taste . 
=================

a descent tasting cookie that still disappoints . . . as an adult who occasionally enjoys a cookie or two . . . or six , i was hoping this new cookie would deliver a satisfying overload of chocolate and texture and become a household staple . and while i was pleased with some aspects of this particular cookie , it did not meet the standards i was expecting . first of all , if one really wants something named " chewy gooey megafudge " to actually taste good , they should skip the calorie counting because , in my opinion , taste has an inverse relationship with calories . so , nutritional info aside , the overall taste for a mass - packaged soft cookie was quite satisfactory . i liked the flavor of the chocolate cookie dough in combination with white - chocolate chips and the injected " fudge " and although the combination of the three sounds extremely rich , the cookies were not " heavy " or overly sweet . the first cookie easily led to a second . . . and then a third , so they did have an addictive quality to them ( maybe now caloric intake should be considered ) . while flavor is important , i predicated my overall satisfaction on other aspects like texture , packaging , value , etc . and i had some issues with the chewy gooey megafudge cookies that generated disappointment : 1 ) texture - for soft cookies , they crumble too much . it is frustrating to take a bite and have the remainder of the cookie falling apart around the fudge in the middle . additionally , the fudge was not gooey , as promised by the name . . . it was more like cake icing . 2 ) packaging - for the size of the bag , there are relatively few cookies . my first disappointment was opening the descent - sized bag of cookies only to find the plastic divider tray consuming most of the space . . . and relatively few cookies . 3 ) cookie size - this was the biggest turn - off . an addictive chocolate - chocolate chip cookie with fudge filling . . . the size of a half - dollar ? c'mon , cookies like this need to be bigger than bite - sized . the lethal combination of tiny cookies and such small quantity ( due to the packaging ) was more than enough to negate the taste for me . in fact , i ` m not sure a cookie - craving moment could be satisfied by a single bag ! increasing the size of the cookie and putting more of them into the bag would make this product a staple in my household .

stale coffee i am not a big coffee drinker . but my wife is . she has bought this in the store and really liked the coffee . i discussed with her and we thought it would be a good idea to put it on subscription . it came . she made her morning coffee and boy i heard about it . you would think someone died . and that someone could have been me ! well to make a point , it was stale . and since we opened a bag it could not be returned so now we have 4 bags of stale coffee . do yourself a favor a pass this one by . seriously . thing is i am disabled . i am not crying about that , but that means a limited income . amazon helps me to order in any items i can . recently i have had to depend on a cane because the pain is too great . the problem in a nutshell is i think there is not enough " stock rotation " in the warehouse . i had the same problem with the duracell batteries . half the package was dead . now all the other thing are fine . i love amazon . i have sold on amazon for years . good customers good people . ( personally , i tried the coffee and it was not the best but i have tasted worse . ) that's all . thank you .

i don't know what 'metallic' taste people are referring to . . . because i just had my first bottle and i couldn't taste a thing . i'm pretty sure those who are freaking out about this probably just couldn't get over the color . yes , it's a little strange drinking something that's black and has no taste to it whatsoever , but once you get past that in your mind , its really just overpriced mineral water .

corn syrup may not be a bad thing ! aight , y'all . this stuff is exactly the same as the earth's best formula . what eb doesn't want you to know is that it also contains corn syrup . eb's ingredient list includes " glucose syrup solids " instead of " corn syrup solids . " but what they don't want you to know is that it is indeed corn syrup . ( i researched and researched to find that this is true . ) so , folks , don't get your panties in a wad over corn syrup . " corn syrup solids " is not the same as " high fructose corn syrup . " it is a sweetener ( dextrose ) , and it is questionable as to whether or not it is better for you than sucrose ( table sugar found in similac organic ) . why do o and eb contain corn syrup ? well , it is to make formula sweet , like breast milk . what do other formulas use ? similac uses table sugar , and a lot of other brands use lactose - - a naturally derived sweetener from milk . lactose is arguably worse for babies , since no human processes lactose as well as dextrose or sucrose . most folks are actually lactose intolerant to some extent , so it's real rough for little babies . so the organic formulas just don't use it , and if they do , it's not in the quantities that it is in enfamil , etc . ( nature's best baby's only is the only odd man out - - they use brown rice syrup - - which is great ( ? ) but hasn't been thoroughly researched as a sugar like additive . ) the other advantage to the organic formulas like eb and o is that they have a more similar whey and casein ratio to human milk than does similac or enfamil . the first ingredient in those formulas is " non fat milk " , whereas the first ingredient in eb and o is " whey . " it's broken down more so babies can digest it better . so yeah . we didn't have success with baby's only . we lurve o and eb and parent's choice organic from walmark - - whichever is on sale , y'all !

too expensive to be worthwhile i almost bought it , but my wife told me that the local supermarket sells lipton herbals ( 20 count ) for about the same price and without paying 1 dollar per box in shipping . so , why should i buy 6 packs and loose $ 4 . 95 in the deal ? 
=================
why buy the other brand when you can buy this ? as demerara sugar cubes , these are basically identical to any other product of their type . so there's no point in describing subjective attributes . the notable thing here is the price . the most well - known and widely distributed brand , la perruche , typically costs $ 8 + per box ( both here on amazon and elsewhere ) . whereas these cost roughly half that for the same quantity of product . so if you're in the market for demerara sugar cubes , get these . it's a no - brainer .

i didn't care for this pack 1st off , this is what is in the box : two of each per 24 pack : - parisian nights extra bold - italian blend - kona blend - breakfast blend - decaf colombian - colombian dorado - rainforest expresso extra bold - hazelnut - chai tea - english breakfast tea - green tea - lemon drinki bought this so my husband could try the teas ( he is not a coffee drinker ) . i paid about $ . 33 per k - cup which is a good price , however i thought the coffees were not that great . i prefer the green mountain brand and i suspect for me , it will be worth it to pay a little more for them .

organic chia seeds : great nutritional profile nutiva raw , certified - organic , non - gmo chia seeds are a great low - carb , gluten - free , omega - 3 containing , high - fiber source of protein . when added to a liquid , after 5 minutes , chia thickens the liquid to a thin tapioca - like consistency while the tiny tan - to - brownish - grey seeds , which look like shiny , slightly elongated , flattened poppy seeds , develop a clear gel coat and stay crunchy . chia seeds can also be added to baked goods , porridges , and smoothies . when eaten straight from the package , the chia seeds are crunchy , for the most part flavorless , and become slippery with a faint seedy , bitter finish , which is minimally noticeable if added to foods . the nutiva chia seeds received were in resealable , opaque , metallicized packages with a " packed on " date of 6 / 22 / 2010 and a " best before " date of 6 / 2012 . great value 2 - pack with amazon free shipping . nutritional facts on label : 1 tbsp = 60 calories ( 25 % from fat ) , 3 g fat , 5 g total carb ( 5g dietary fiber = 0 net carbs ) , 3 g protein , sodium 0 mg , potassium 60 mgof note , nutiva chia seeds are a product of ecuador

great ingredient list , poor real - life performance with my taste - test panel i bought a case of merrick surf & turf with high hopes for my clutter of nine cats . alas , the hype didn't live up to the reality . the product is essentially a wasted purchase , as virtually none of the cats will touch the stuff . i'll be donating the rest of the case to my local animal shelter for their pet food pantry . the ingredient list drew me to the product , being grain - free , and offering a nice mix of meat and seafood , plus lots of complex carbohydrates for filler . upon opening the can , it was clear that the beef and beef fat content was pretty high , with little seafood scent detectable . it came out of the can in big globs that were sticky to try to mush down for my gang . have tried two feedings for my gang with this stuff , and they just can't be convinced that it's both tasty and good for them . i realize that different cats have different sets of taste buds and some cats will eat anything , but when none of my nine will touch the stuff , i can't recommend it to anyone with an even semi - finicky cat , as a number of my gang will eat most anything , and to find them turning up their noses at this somewhat pricey stuff is kinda eye - popping . if you're cat is very picky , but you know s / he likes beef , then this flavor will probably appeal to him / her , but otherwise , i wouldn't spend your hard - earned moolah on this stuff . save your money and your frustration . i give it two stars simply because of its relatively healthy ingredient list ; i'd otherwise give it only one star .

want to drink pool water but don't want the chlorine ? get this no matter how much or how little of the product i put into my water ( filtered or unfiltered ) , it always ends up smelling and tasting like chlorinated pool water . i'd heard good things about mio , and i love peaches , so i thought i would try this . i'm regretting my decision .

protein . good . taste . bad i went ahead and ordered the cereal because i've tried the regular special k ( which tastes pretty good ) , and figured this would be like that except with protein . you can imagine my " if it sounds too good to be true . . " moment when i had my first bowl . now i'm a pretty utilitarian kind of guy , i like good food , but i can eat just about anything edible just for survival . this is what this cereal is all about . eating out of necessity . the taste is almost non - existent , which i can live with , but the texture is what kills me . all i can think about is cardboard boxes which were ripped into flakes and hardened . ( the color of the cereal doesn't convince you otherwise either ) now i don't care about high fructose corn syrup and all that , but if something tastes this bad . . . . it should at least be 100 % good for you . i don't think i will be ordering more . protein is good , but you know . . life can be rough . . . you don't need to start out each day with rough cereal

it's saving my couches i have had this scratcher for about three months . i have been buying several scratchers over the past year because my cats like to scratch the couches . my cats do not like the smaller cardboard scratchers because they are not at an incline and they move when my cats scratch them . they also are not that interested in the turbo scratcher with the ball . at first my cats didn't warm up to this scratcher as much , although they really liked the toy . however , now they enjoy the scratcher 200 % . i also give them a treat when they scratch where they are supposed to scratch . i have been using a lot of double - sided carpet tape ( you can get it at most hardware stores in the carpet section . ) i attach it to where the cats scratch so that they get sticky paws and don't want to scratch there again . i also use it to attach this scratcher to the floor so it doesn't move when my cats scratch . try this scratcher before you try the expensive scratchers that cost $ 50 or more . also , anchor it to the floor with carpet tape .

have been enjoying this chocolate for over 20 years , but now . . . i remember the first time i tried a lindt 70 % bar , when i visited france as a child . my parents bought several to bring back to the states , and they were cherished and eaten slowly . i've enjoyed them as a special treat ever since . sadly , that era has ended . the " new recipe " is a shadow of the former lindt chocolate . it tastes like pretty much any other standard dark chocolate bar - - none of the crisp , vibrant , complexity it used to have . i guess all good things eventually come to an end . . . too bad .

disappointing i bought this for our young son and was disappointed in several aspects of this dispenser : ( 1 ) it's made of cheap plastic and arrived w / the globe scratched and cracked . ( 2 ) the top doesn't screw on - - it just pops off w / very little exertion . ( 3 ) part of the appeal for me was that this dispenser is coin - operated . what the description on amazon doesn't tell you , however , is that a coin is not necessary to dispense the candy . furthermore , when the crank is just barely turned , the candy ( usually two pieces ) flies out so quickly that some goes on the floor w / o your hand there to catch it . a young child is often not coordinated enough to turn the crank and put his hand out to catch the candy . ( 4 ) the dispenser only came w / enough candy to just fill the bottom of the globe . ( 5 ) it is very much over - priced at $ 29 . 99 .

more mocha than peppermint i'm not the biggest fan of powder creamers , but coffee - mate has always been the best of all i've ever used . that being said , my wife purchased this for me to compliment the flavor of any unpleasantly cheap coffee i would subjected to while deployed overseas , and i was thankful for it . while it did the job of making plain coffee taste better , i was disappointed by the lack of peppermint flavor ( she got it for me specifically because of my love of mint ) . the smell is sweet , and you get hints of both mocha and a little peppermint . however the flavor of peppermint is lacking , and you're more or less left with a mocha creamer that only tastes slightly different than an ordinary mocha creamer . it may not completely live up to its name , but i would still recommend it .

buy it locally , these ship close to expiration date ordered three bottles because the local store was out . each bottle had about 30 days left on the expiration . which is precisely why they are so cheap here .

not a bad sauce but not tikka masala at all . . . i picked this up at publix this morning to make for lunch . it is a tasty sauce , though expensive at publix ( as usual ) , but i am being totally honest here is stating that the taste resembles nothing like tikka masala . it is good though .

not worth the money . . make your own ! we were given this product as a gift . ok , i can forgive the fact that i'm a pastry chef and i was given a mix for a gift : - 0 but i have always made my own frosting from scratch and have for years . it's one of the easiest things to make ! ! ! make your cake from a mix if you want but . . . . i looked at the back of this box to see what was in it and . . . seriously it's just powdered sugar ( . 80 cents worth ) , salt ( . 05 cents worth ) and vanilla ( maybe 20 cents worth ) . i mean , i 'm glad that this small company is making themselves some money but really you should spend your money on other more difficult to make items . ( or all the medical bills that come along with the issues of gluten allergy . ) honestly folks here is all you do for awesome frosting : 1 box ( 16 oz ) of powdered sugar ( put it in a bowl ) 1 pinch salt ( put it in the bowl 1 teaspoon vanilla ( in the bowl ) 1 cup margarine ( at room temp , in the bowl ) 4 tbl soy milk or other milk ( in the bowl ) mix it all up with a mixer till it is light and fluffy ( about 5 minutes ) . . . if you want chocolate add 4 tbl of cocoa powder and another tbl of milk

kettle foods spicy thai chips the spicy thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market . however , kettle foods has changed the ingredients used , with ginger being the most important that is now missing . notice that they removed " ginger with attitude " from the bag . sadly , the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me . they aren't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non - existent . here are the original and new ingredient listings : original ingredientsselect potatoes , safflower and / or sunflower oil , honey powder ( evaporated cane syrup , honey ) salt , garlic powder , jalapeno pepper , ground ginger , onion powder , habanero pepper , dried parsley , citric acid , cilantro extract , ginger oil , cayenne pepper , white pepper , lime oil . new ingredientspotatoes , safflower and / or sunflower oil , sugar , dried cane syrup , salt , maltodextrin , yeast extract , spices , garlic powder , onion powder , dried parsley , jalapeno powder , citric acid , natural flavors , lime extracti'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner , blue diamond . they might want to get rid of " great taste naturally " from their bags as i don't consider maltodextrin to be very natural . great job kettle ! way to ruin a great thing !

one coconut water has fabulous health benefits but if you are used to sweet coconut waters the taste is not what you expect because this is 100 % coconut water ( the real deal . if you have ever had goya or el mexicano coconut waters , they are only 70 % coconut water and 30 % sugar and junk and the calorie content is around 180 . one coconut water calorie content is only 60 , no fat and it does not leave any aftertaste , just refreshing . i personally shake a pack of splenda into it . i like the variety with the splash of pineapple , passion fruit or guava too and their calorie content is not that high either and i don't put splenda in them as they are naturally sweetened . i will not buy vita brand coconut water because i found it it has celebrity investors and that right there just taints it . ( madonna and a few others have a stake in vita ) i wrote to one on their website and asked about coupons and they arrived in my mailbox about 7 days later ! they were $ . 50 off and i got my coconut water for $ . 99 . nice surprise and this type of customer service will keep me coming back to this brand .

used for years ! i have only used liquid stevia for my tea and coffee for the past 2 years - now's is a fantastic price - i won't change ! if you want fast delivery , though , don't order through nutricity . i ordered it ( as a prime member ) and didn't receive it for 9 days - meaning i couldn't take it with me on the trip - which is why i ordered the 2 oz bottle . . . .

we only buy blue buffalo we used to feed our dogs " regular " dog food , until we realized it had all kinds of by - products and things that not even us humans would want to eat . so we switched to blue buffalo . i usually buy whatever flavor is on sale that week , and they do really well with switching from one flavor to another . . . as long as we stick to blue buffalo brand . i have noticed with the fish flavor , their coats are shinier . we wouldn't go back to any other dog food , bb is well worth the money .

ordered in place of 5 hour . . . no replacement ! ! i have been on autoship for the 5 hour energy drinks for a while here at amazon , but this time they emailed me , on my two subscriptions that they couldn't fill them . . . and they suggested i try the red rain that customers buy this many times instead . so i did . i read some of the reviews . . . tastes better , lasts longer , etc . so thought i'll give it a shot . i don't want to totally shoot them down ~ they're not awful , and they are cheaper than the 5 hour energy drink . . . but you know they saying you get what you pay for ? yup , in this case it holds true . i didn't find them to taste any better , in fact i really liked the berry taste less , but regardless it's not a great tastes no matter how you look at it . but what i really found lacking was the boost . while it does give you that initial energy boost , it's not as fast or as great as that you get from the 5 hour drink , and it does not last anywhere near 5 hours ! i have to drink 2 in the time i'd drink 1 5 hour , and still find myself dragging . i work the graveyard shift , so alertness is sometimes something i have to trick my body into . . . it really aint gonna happen w / thisred rain energy shot . in my opinion , it was a waste of my money .

hotter than heidi klum and more powerful than a gorilla on acid i bought this hot sauce as my gift for a white elephant party . i had watched several videos of people tasting it and watched them all writhe in pain and many go to the ground . i knew that this stuff was potent and could potentially be used in nuclear weapons . someone ended up picking it and brought it out to try . i wanted no part of this . while she was attempting to dole out her punishment some of it got on the kitchen table . i went to wipe it up with a rag and accidentally got a small drop on my finger . i instantly washed if off as i didn't want any of its pain to somehow seep into my skin . 30 minutes later i found out the power that this beast holds . i was talking to some people when all of a sudden it felt like someone had lit my junk on fire . this wasn't a " when you go raw dogg with some shady club chick " type of burning . this was more like pouring napal down my pants type of burning . apparently water and soap are not enough to get a drop of this stuff off of your skin . i didn't know that i had to wear gloves to go take a leak after being in the presence of this hot suace . safe to say for the next 20 - 30 minutes i was in more pain than having to watch the notebook twice in a row .

availability and pricing cafe verona is my favorite of the starbucks coffees and i was delighted to see it available in k kups ; however , i do not understand why the price is so high on amazon when it's available at costco for $ 34 . 95 for the 54 count package . this price difference boggles my mind . i've also noticed the starbucks kkups available in grocery stores for a lower price per unit than amazon . this is why i gave the product one star only . 
=================
is it stale ? like a few other reviewer here , i noticed right away after opening the bag ( cinnamon oat clusters ) that it smelled like stale grains or stale peanuts . it's a pretty strong odor but it wasn't overpowering . since i am not familiar with some of the grains in the bag , i thought maybe they have some distinct odors that are similar to what i assume is a stale smell . for reference , i know the smell of flax seed , oats , and rice , and they smell nothing like what i was smelling from this bag . despite the strange smell , i still tried a few bites , and the taste wasn't too bad but i know it would have been better without that lingering smell . just like the others who have complained , the expiration date on my bag is august 29 , 2012 , so the product should have still been good . also , like others , i felt that there really weren't many clusters as the picture on the product shows . the lack of larger clusters makes it harder to be a hand snack but you can still pour it in a cereal bowl and add milk . previously i have enjoyed kind products , so this experience won't prevent me from trying other kind products . however , i may be hesitant to try this particular product again . i'll be glad to change my review though if kind sends me another bag - - and it doesn't have that peculiar smell . 
=================
not bad but . . . as others mentioned , a bit chewy . i bought both the original and hot . the hot burned - - for days .

warm water surprised with this one as the coffee bean & tea leaf rules cali and serves up the best coffee and teas . i tried many cups and am can say this chai is my least favorite chai ever . the tea is like warm water and very weak . i would not suggest this to anyone that enjoys a good tea . 
=================
excellent chocolate . the chocolate is excellent but vitamin cottage ships spoiled bars . they are chalky and some bars have melted at some point . endangered species species dark chocolate is great but vitamin cottage should do a better job of caring for the product . vitamin cottage also ignored a complaint about the shipment . 
=================
taste just like real pasta because it is . i am a low carb eater and one serving of this kicked me right out of ketosis . it tastes awesome , cause it's pasta . regular old pasta . 
=================
ok for an alternative snack purchased this variety pack and although i was very impressed with amazon prime shipping ( i literally received it in less than 24 hours ! ) , the snack itself is average tasting . mostly like flavorless cardboard . the best flavor is the jalapeno one , pretty spicy . it satisfies the crunch and salt factor , but no way is this a replacement for real chips . i recommend popchips original flavor which reminds me of munchos , or popchips bbq flavor ; both are satisfying and taste very good . i would not purchase these gourmet basics smart fries again . i even joked with my co - workers when they asked me what i was eating . . " they're smart fries , but they're not so smart since they don't taste that good ! " they tasted for themselves and they all pretty much agreed with me . 
=================
reformulated version much worse than before when this product became a " helper complete meal " instead of just a regular " complete meal " , they reformulated the topping , which used to be a breadcrumb - based parmesan - cheese blend . the new topping is literally just parmesan cheese , and not a lot of it , and the product is notably worse off for it . overall , the flavor is very mild , not " alfredo " at all , but it is still reasonably tasty and the chicken tastes pretty good . the overall flavor is a generic creamy chicken dish with some hints of cheese . it is , however , a delusion to suggest it feeds 4 - the amount of chicken is enough for 2 ( or maybe 2 adults + 1 child ) . what is there is indeed easy to make , and tastes pretty good for a thing out of a box . if you're just running out of steam but still want something with some 'comfort food' vibe , then this is ok . however , if you're looking for a high - quality meal , look elsewhere . the mexican - style version of this with the rice is much better tastewise , for the same price . 
=================
forget what dentists and doctors say , spoil yourself your worth it ! what is there to really say about several bags of candy ? i ordered this item as a special halloween deal that caused it to be 1 / 3 of the face value . i received 3 bags of candy that were 19 . 5 ounces in weight . this is convent for me since i am busy with work right now and do not have the time to worry about the upcoming halloween trick or treaters that i am expecting . downside ? i live in texas and these arrived on a 90 degree day . with it being 90 outside , i can only imagine how much these candies melted in the large metallic van and shipping cases these were sent in . 
=================
why the change ? this is the only food that has worked for my dog , and then they started adding a bunch of other ingredients that don't seem necessary . the point of a hypo - allergenic food is to have one protein and one carb . suddenly there's quinoa and kamut flakes . i don't think they're too much of an issue ( yet ) , but the inclusion of apples is a definite problem . now i need to find another hypo - allergenic food . . . . 
=================
taste is gone in minutes i think the licorice flavor is very weak and the gum is almost flavorless in about 10 minutes . other people seem to disagree with me so maybe i have been ruined by eating too much really strong licorice over the years . i still enjoy the gum though so i will continue to buy it .

cannot get good roast i have previously ordered various green coffee bean types from a couple websites with good roasting success . i decided to try this product on amazon for its good price and free shipping . however , i've tried various degrees of roasting from very light to very dark and cannot get this coffee to taste good . there just seems to be no flavor . i use a nesco cr - 1000 . 
=================
still searching . . . . i am searching for a different mix this time . the brownies taste great , but the frosting is weird tasting . it almost has a coffee flavor . . . which is not intentional or tasty . i like the brownies , but hate throwing out the frosting each time . plus , these take over 40 minutes to bake and i want something i can throw together more quickly . 
=================
good stuff , but . . . my two bags were kind of " sweaty " . the powder and the sour patch kids all appeared to have gotten wet at some point . taste was not affected , but still , i wonder what was the cause of the moisture .

i am unable to split these capsules for a half serving ; - ( my family is very sensitive to everything . lots of allergies , overly sensitive to prescriptions , etc . so , we regularly cut the dose in half of most things we use as a precaution . in fact when i drink juice , i dilute it 60 - 75 % with water - just becuase the flavors are so strong to me . so , i purchased these and planned to split these into smaller servings . i was going to use my empty gel caps which i keep at home to be able to split them . but , they do not use standard size gel caps ! ! i have always been able to use standard o , 1 , 2 or 3 size capsules which i get from my local pharmacy . but these dehydrated water capsules must be imported , since they do not fit any of the standards us sizes . i am afraid to use the entire capsule all at once due to my very sensitive nature , so i can't really comment on its strength or it's flavor . but if you are interested in splitting the serving size down i recommend you find an american source for these - as these can not be split . jk : - ) 
=================
this is not gluten - free and should not be in the gluten - free list of cereals ! although amazon has this cereal ( nature's path hemp granola gluten free ) in the " gluten - free " specialty section , the manufacturer does not consider it to be gluten - free due to the presence of oats that are non - gf certified . i'm sure the cereal is quite good , but because i assumed that amazon was careful in assigning items to the gluten - free list , i bought it and now can't eat it . please be cautious when purchasing " gluten - free " items from amazon and always check with the manufacturer if in doubt . amazon , please take note of this and make the correction ! enough already ! 
=================
needs more variety this is a fairly decent package with an uneven distribution . instead of receiving 10 cups of each product as one might anticipate , the box has twice the number of cups of frosted flakes and about six cups of cocoa puffs . unfortunately , the raisin bran crunch is the spoiler in this package . the raisins are tough , difficult to chew , and lay on the bottom of the cup so don't expect to find any raisins until the cereal is just about gone . 
=================
yuk ! ! ! ! if you like the flavor of cardboard , then you will like this because that's what it tastes like . i like coffees that are strong flavored . . . this is not it as it has little flavor at all . i guess the saying is true . . . " you get what you pay for " price is cheap and it tastes cheap . i'm sorry i bought it . please contact me if you would like one opened can and one sealed can and i'll give it to you for free . actually , i wouldn't want to give this to a homeless person because i'd hate to put them through the unpleasant taste . surprising to see some people said they like it . wish i could have agreed with them . opened one of the cans , it didn't even leave an aroma which was my first clue that it would probably not even have a pleasant taste . then i tried several varied amounts in the brewing process thinking that eventually i would get a decent tasting cup of coffee . . . . . no such luck ! ! ! i ordered based on the other reviews here on amazon . worst coffee i've ever tasted and comes close to the taste of coffee aboard some navy ships where the coffee has been brewing for about 5 hours or more . i strongly recommend others to avoid this brand and try something else . i normally like to use whole beans and ground them myself . . . this is the first step to making truly flavorful coffee . if you use paper filters , let a cup of water run through them then empty the carafe and then put your freshly ground beans in the filter and brew . this process takes out the mill - dust that all paper filters have in them which will taint the flavor of the coffee if you don't do this process . as for store brand coffee , i would recommend the selection at kroger called spotlight or the other called private select . a good non generic store brand coffee is community coffee . if you are fortunate to have a central market grocery store near you , try the fine selection of whole bean coffees . 
=================
don't listen to the negative reviews don't listen to the negative reviews , they're completely wrong . i read the reviews but still went ahead and bought it and was very surprised at how fantastic these noodles are . yes , they do smell pretty bad when you take them out of the package , but all you do is run them under water . the taste and texture of them tastes identical to real pasta , they're not chewy or rubbery or anything like people in other reviews said , if you prepare and cook these noodles according to what it says on the packaging they will be identical to real pasta in every single way and you will not be able to tell the difference . 
=================
not a patch on the sojos grain free add meat ! sadly for me and the time i spend cooking ground turkey for my little darlings , they really didn't like the sojos complete food . they love the add meat variety ( love love love ) but this - they ate when they were starving , but otherwise ignored . i wish they loved it it would be so much easier ! they are little yorkies - perhaps it's a breed thing . 
=================
smells like chicken ! , not like cat food at all . : o ) i wish my cats would eat this . one cat will lick up all the liquid , eat some of the shredded chicken but not all . bummer cause this is the cleanest canned cat food i've come across . from the smell you'd never think this was a cat food . unfortunately petco only had the good karma chicken dinner adult canned cat food in gravy ( . 99 per can ) or i would have gotten all of their offerings . i've recently taken in ( or been taken in by ) a stray and he will not eat anything but safeway's mom - to - mom chicken baby food , and california natural chicken and brown rice dry . weird and totally frustrating . which is how i came across this soulistic btw . my other cat has been getting real finicky for the past couple of yrs .

chocolate chalk we have tried other flavors of the cookies with fair texture and good flavor , but these taste like chocolate chalk .

great ingredients but dogs wont eat it ! i saw this online and was very impressed with the ingredients so i ordered it but my dogs wont eat it . even the one who eats everything wont eat it . i was hoping they would love it since it looked very healthy and it's really expensive but it was a big flop ! 
=================
panda candy - i am an addict i love panda candy . seriously . i named my kitten panda after it . i have gone through so many little pink boxes of raspberry flavored confection it's a bit disturbing . i like the black too , but too much real black licorice can raise your blood pressure and has other side effects . cocoa ones were amazing , but seem to have been discontinued . so that leaves me with raspberry , not a bad situation to be in . these chews are fat free . one serving is 130 calories . there is no refined sugar or artificial ingredients . it contains molasses as a sweetener , wheat flour , citric acid and natural flavor . the texture is soft and chewy , but not lose a filling chewy . it's a much better texture than a twizzler for example . not waxy or rubbery at all . i can see it's not for everyone . i do not agree that it tastes like prunes or apricots . to me it has a sweet barely tart raspberry flavor that tastes like candy , but perhaps more wholesome . i suggest trying a bar to see if the taste suits you , as opposed to buying 12 boxes ! 
=================
not for all kids this particular flavor got mixed reviews from my twins . . one loved it the other hated it . that's why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 .

so many mixed reviews . . i was really excited and surprised when i found this mix in my local wal mart . given it was a good price , i figured id give it a shot . . . . before i whipped up a batch i figured id do a little investigating to see if there was any input / suggestions on the mix . wow . is everyone using the same mix or what ? reviews from " its great " to " its horrible " . . like a total 50 / 50 split . soooooo , before i wasted a bunch of money on products to whip up a batch and see for myself , i figured id simply open the packae up and take a taste to the mix , all on its own . . . . ummmmm , yeah . it totally has a pretty strong bitter after taste . : / and , like another reviewer , i had figured this mix would be adequately sweet enough for me and not need any extra sweetener ( i dont like things very sweet , at all ) but its def not . as i re read the ingredients i realized there isnt any sugar / sweetener in this mix so , youd def need to add sweetening . but , overall , i dont even plan on taking this mix that far . im pretty certain that adding sugar wont take that aftertaste away . thats an issue with the flour mix and no amount of sugar is going to make that go away . . . . . id strongly suggest avoiding this mix . . . . i hope the company works on this mix . it has good elements to it ( i like the fact you can determine how sweet youd want it and the apple pieces are pretty tasty ) and i think it could be really tasty .

see's truffles through amazon i have already communicated with the see's company about my disappointment in the item they sell as truffles . my definition of truffles and see's are not the same . the candy they sent was delicious and i ate it all , but it was not what i expected i . e . round chocolates filled with various flavors of chocolate ganache . the item see's sells as truffles was a box of assorted soft centered chocolates of various shapes . i may buy other candy from see's in the future , but certainly not truffles .

no artificial sweetners - good soft drink alternative i started drinking crystal geyser sparkling mineral water , both lime and lemon flavored , about a month ago . i wanted to get away from diet soft drinks / sodas that i have been drinking most of my life , but still wanted a carbonated beverage . on the advice of one of my co - workers , i bought some crystal geyser brand and have found it to be a viable alternative . the limon / lime taste is mild , so if you are looking for a strong or predominant lime / lemonade taste , this isn't the drink for you . i do note for those seeking to avoid artificial sweetners , that none are listed on the packaging of this brand . most other flavored waters , either carbonated or non - carbonated , use aspartame or some other artificial sweetner . crystal geyser is the only brand of carbonated water that is available at the grocery stores in my area of central texas that does not . crystal geyser mineral water lime , 42 . 27 - ounce ( pack of 12 )

shipped fast , no weight specified i received the shipment quickly ; however , i was a little disappointed when i opened the box as it was only a 5 ounce package . i bought another color of sprinkles from a different company , paid the same price and got 16 ounces . the seller did not specify in the description how many ounces was included in the price . i took the risk because i needed the sprinkles and couldn't find them . i will know next time to ask the question before purchasing .

surprised at sugar content i picked these up at the health food store - as the dr . sears reccommendation caught my eye . my eight month old son immensely enjoyed them , and i looked at the ingredients and was really surprised to find sugar listed second , right after the cultured milk . it is organic sugar yes , but still added sugar - and i'm bummed as this was not something that i wanted to introduce to his diet yet . my fault that i was swayed by advertising , and didn't read the back .

beat milkbone in our exhaustive test our two beagles seemed to prefer newman's over milkbone . with each dog , we conducted two separate sniff - taste tests between newman's own lamb and barley dog treat and the small size milkbone essentials plus optimal health biscuits . we figured the milkbone product was more like the newman's than the fake dog jerky - a . k . a . dog crack - we also had on the shelf . the tests took place after they had eaten meals . the test subjects were1 . maggie - the almost 9 - year - old vacuum cleaner beagle who will eat anything , especially if it comes out of a plastic bag ( have to warn visitors who bring their toiletries in zip bags because she will take the bags outside ) . 2 . lucy - the 8 - year - old rescue beagle we took in , who is pickier about her chow , but can sniff out anything food related from 4 - feet away ( she could have a career sniffing out illegal food in luggage , seriously ) . the test method was to hold 1 / 2 of a newman's treat in one hand and a milkbone in the other . first we let them smell our hands with the treats inside our fists . then we did the switcheroo behind our back and put them out in open palms . both dogs preferred the smell of newman's after breakfast and went for the little square as soon as we opened our hands . the sniff part of the after dinner tests were a little inconclusive . maggie went for the newman's completely . but lucy was a little confused at first . she kept sniffing the milkbone hand initially - - but we believe there was contamination problem with the test because i had just eaten a cheez - it . after the old switcheroo , she went for the newman's instantly . so , the dogs preferred to eat the newman's , but lucy initially preferred the faint smell of cheez - its contaminant in one sniff test session . from a cookie giver's perspective , newman's did not have an overwhelming gross smell to it . the bag it comes in has a zip top , so they may keep their scent longer than the average milkbone turning stale inside a cardboard box . note : i did think the obviously photoshopped paul newman graphic on the packaging was a little creepy . i'm sure he hadn't had arms that looked like that since " cool hand luke . " it might be time to just let his image rest in peace .

she loved it . . . but eventually did it in . . . this is possibly one of my german shepherd / border collie pups favorite toys ever . . . that being said she did manage to do it in . she is an aggressive chewer and managed to chew off the rubber around the top of the jug - which made it unsafe for her to keep playing with . it did keep her busy for hours trying to get her food or treats out of it . if you do have an aggressive chewer check out the squirrel dude . . . same concept of a treat to eat toy - not as much room inside and easier to do so it doesn't last as long at least for my dog - but it has stayed in one piece ! premier squirrel dude large

great yummy product , insane price ! i have been eating the pik - nik shoestring potatoes ever since i was a kid . i always liked them better then potato chips . i can buy these in the store but since my family eats a lot of these i was hoping to get a good deal thru amazon . not ! ! ! the price for these when shipping is added does not make for a good deal ! matter of fact , i'd consider these at $ 40 . 16 for a case of 12 , from the distributor that is carrying them , to be a huge rip _ off ! that makes each 9 oz . can cost $ 4 . 16 each ! ! ! i can buy the same size can at my local market for 2 . 49 each . so don't get ripped off with this one folks ! remember , the product is great , the price is not !

taste is extremely unpalatable . . . i haven't been taking this supplement long enough to confidently say that it's made a huge difference in my energy level but i haven't seen any negative side effects so i've continued with it hoping to see a difference soon . however , one thing i can confidently say about it is that the taste is so unappetizing that i have a hard time drinking it . there's a cloying sweetness to it that is reminiscent of cherry flavored cough syrup , only it's green and in powder form . . .

cat loves but it makes her throw up i've been buying thus for my cat for about 6 months now . she's always had a bit of a problem with throwing up so i didn't notice itr at first . but now that i've had a few months of experience with it i can confirm that it makes her throw up . i would say 7 out of 10 times she throws up not even after , but while she's eating it ! at first i didn't think anything about it , i thought she was just randomly throwing up . but today i noticed she threw up while she was near finishing what i had put down for her . so just as a test i decided to give her a little more and she threw up in less than a minute of eating it . so , i don't know what to tell you . maybe it's just my cat . i can't imagine they sell this and it happens to every car ! my cat is 16 and in really good health considering her age . but maybe it's age related , i don't know . i just know i won't bed able to give her this anymore . but i'm going to have to find a good substitute fast because she's so addicted to it , she starts yelling for more every day at the same time ! !

k - cups burst , blowing grounds all over machine and counter i recently purchased a 50 x pack of butter toffee k cups . i'm experiencing an alarming number of k cups bursting during the brewing process . it seems as though some of the k cups aren't as pressurized as other and the ones with less pressure seem to be the ones that burst . i'd estimate that i've had about 30 % of the 50 cups blow coffee grounds out all over my brewer . purchased through and sold by amazon . com

not what it claims or a bit deceptive we tried this product , a bunch of us . and we are all vegetarian . we also do not like onion or garlic ; one of the friends esp . is sensitive to this . well , even calling the company , they are not forthcoming , because we could taste garlic in it , and compared to " tasty eats " soy jerky , this does not even compare . so first , the ingredient " vegetarian spices " includes granulated garlic powder , possibly onion . in ayurvedic terms , this is not sathwic for one's body . we totally recommend the soy jerky by tasty eats . we ordered six cases of the ginger . they use no onion or garlic in any of their products . most companies do list " spices " but they will almost always label garlic or onion powder separately . this company who makes the primal strips does not . after all the comparisons , we found tasty eats soy jerky to be the best taste , quality and texture . in fact , they are out of teriyaki , their best selling jerky , the original flavor , peppered and hot n' spicy . but we will order cases of them when they become available . they provide a first class jerky that is healthy and proper for everyone ; esp . vegans and vegetarians .

more expensive : ( this product used to be affordable for a poor student like me , but now , they have upped the price and decreased the number of boxes . unacceptable

new recipie is not as good as the original this used to be awesome . . . the dumplings were soft little morsels , the broth was creamy and rich , and the flavor was unstoppable . then they went " organic . " it's not nearly as flavorful as it used to be and the only real spice you can taste is black pepper . it still beats campbells , but for one fatal flaw , i simply can't recomend it anymore : this reformulation has the worst dumplings ever . they're hard , rubbery , flat slices off a larger " dumpling stick . " the texture isn't entirely different from octopus or a really dense soy . overall do i like it ? yes . would i recommend it ? no .

fixed i ordered this for my boyfriend for father's day . the food was disgusting . we didn't even bother trying the " black taffy " , which was nothing more than very bad licorice . the next were some kind of nuts with a sweet shell around them . they were disgusting . they had no flavor and what flavor they did have tasted a bit like dirt . the next two things were chocolate chip cookies and some other type of cookie . we figured how bad can they screw up a chocolate chip cookie . . . . well they were dry and tasted horrible . i ended up throwing out everything , and you have to understand we don't throw out food , at all . i was terribly disappointed . i just figured that i trusted amazon , so i should be able to trust the products they sell . this was not the case . after leaving complaint with this company they refunded my money and were very helpful .

pure raw man , you can really taste that this is the real thing ! powerful flavor ! not processed with alkali , or all that sugar & stuff like some other dark chocolate brands . i melted it in my oatmeal ~ mmmmmmmm . . . not a bad price either ! don't buy this if you can't stomach a very bitter strong taste . get this if you want the real benefits of flavanols / antioxidants from dark chocolate !

wish it had worked this food has such high ratings , i wish it had worked . i have a black lab / weim mix who is over 2 year olds and about 100 lb . as he aged ( turned 2 in april ) his ears kept getting worse and worse with black smelly gunk and nothing the vet gave helped . he also started chewing feet and legs ( made a bare spot on one leg ) . after researching i decided it must be food allergies . i changed to dr . e's great life grain free potato free limited ingredient buffalo - worked great ears cleared up . no foot / leg chewing , skin wasn't shedding white flakes as much . but . . . he hated it . he would dribble pieces on the floor - i had to mix it with stuff ( i'm just not the type who will starve my dog till he eats ) . he also leaned up quite a bit though he wasn't an overweight dog . i figured since his ears were clear but he hated this , i would try this food as it sounded so good . what a disaster . he loved it . gobbled it down and wanted more . he gained weight ( not in a good way now he looks fat ) , his ears got stinky , his feet got itchy and his skin was so dry and flaky he looked like a partially white dog and his hair was flying out in handfuls . am going to keep looking as i don't think i can keep feeding him the other as it was such a struggle but really disappointed this didn't work . as a side note , we were at the bottom of the barrel with his old food and i didn't do a two week intro as i usually do , plus his probiotics had run out but he had zero diarreah issues switching over to this . i did mix it with grandma lucy's grain free chicken dog food but he was having that on his food before and was cleared up so i don't think that was it . also , some have mentioned not to mix this with water so i'm glad he didn't have bloat issues though i did ( as the grandma lucy's is a dry flake you rehydrate ) 
=================
ginger overload , not much lemon the ginger flavor in this product is very sharp . it actually has a bit of a burn , almost as if you would have put a touch of cayenne pepper in it . but this is the pungency you would find in a raw bit of ginger . i didn't taste any lemon actually , and the product probably needed a little bit more sweetness to offset the sharp ginger taste . the granules inside the pouch are like ovaltine and instantly dissolved . overall if you like a strong in your face tea this would be for you . 
=================
almost but not quite i had never even heard of canned potato salad much less tasted it . however , i'm out here in the arizona desert and things spoil even in refrigerators . i browsed through the grocery & gourmet section , found read german potato salad and decided to give it a try . the taste is there but it lacks the mayonnaise texture . other than that it's great .

enough transfat to stop a train in its tracks ; enough sugar to induce diabetic shock , enough flour to block an artery but that irresistible dickensian odor as it warms . . . british culinary experience is not world noted . from london's bangers and mash to liverpool's scouse to glasgow's haggis , this isle of bad teeth is not normally sought for its kitchen fare . and so within this small can it comes to us . in dickens we read of the ravenous appetites consuming the most bizarre items , of tiny tim's bag of lard boiled with brandy and a plum , of whatever it was fagin gave his small boys in london's slums . here we share a taste of those delights . do not let this discourage you . let a can of this sit ( opened ) in a pan of bubbling hot water , alongside a can of evaporated milk . this in itself makes an adequate holiday pot - pourri , filling your house with cozy warmth , and this is undoubtedly the only safe manner to consume it : olfactory rather than gustatory , considering the transfats , sugars and flour . ( remember my child the warm mothering spirit of adele davis , she of let's eat right to keep fit , warning us of the three white poisons : salt , sugar and refined flour , oh yeah and fats ) . yet , for those who truly find this " to die for " place the pudding on one bowl , pour the milk on top , add extra cinnamon , and as desired , honey or molasses over all , and enjoy . best thing since indian pudding !

great ( compared to other instant coffees ) i rarely drink instant coffee , but sometimes go to rural india on medical trips . outside of starbucks cafes and large western style hotels ( in all cities , but not in rural india ) it is nearly impossible to get brewed coffee in india . ask for coffee , and you get instant , everywhere in india ( except as noted ) . anyway , to get a coffee fix on the go , i've tried the starbucks via columbia packets , and ( for instant coffee ) they are wonderful , won't fool you into thinking you've got a good cup of brewed coffee , but better than common western office coffee , and much better than the instant served in rural india . the starbucks packs cost 75 cents to $ 1 each , and i was hoping the nescafe clasico packs would be nearly as good , at 1 / 8 the price . unfortunately , not . if you want something that reminds you of brewed coffee , bite the bullet and pay for the starbucks . 
=================
not as good as before saw this in the grocery store recently and was very excited . as a fan of the previous fruit filled version , i was eager to try a bowlful as soon as i got home . the mixed berry flavor was very sweet & artificial , and by the time i'd eaten less than half the bowl i'd had enough . the flavors from before like strawberry and raisin tasted very fruity and complimented the frosted shredded cereal perfectly . when there is already frosting on the top side of the square , the filling doesn't need to be super sweet . it tasted like a frosted mixed berry pop tart , so i'm sure kids and younger folk will be a fan on this cereal , and perhaps that is who it is marketed to now .

half filled my first time ordering / using this product as i am restocking for my seasonal / holiday baking . hoping i'm not going to be disappointed how ever i'm confused about the size of the apple pie spice , it's in a 16oz bottle but the label says 8oz when i compare it to the 8oz bottle of pumpkin pie spice it's about 2 - 3 oz less . i intend to contact the seller about this matter because i have more items in my cart i want to purchase , hoping i don't have to change my mind of course . i will keep you posted on the outcome . 
=================
warning - open mesh coffee pods , not k - cups i've urged amazon to change this product's listing so as not to trick anyone else into buying it , but until they do , i want to add my voice to the revelations hidden in a few reviews that are already here . please be warned that while the first cup of this coffee is tasty , the second is unlikely to be as good , and the twelfth is almost guaranteed to be disappointing unless you're the twelve - cup - a - day sort of household . why ? simply put , these are not k - cups . they are not individually sealed portions , but instead are open mesh coffee pods , not dissimilar to senseo pods , topped with a k - cup - like plastic ring and foil cover . that cover does make them work in keurig brewers , but you lose the important freshness - preserving feature of k - cups . the company could lessen this problem by putting its pods in a resealable plastic bag , but they chose to instead use a plastic bag reminiscent of those in cereal boxes - - just much , much harder to open . that's especially ironic given amazon's recent move toward frustration - free packaging . i strongly encourage you to move on to another product until the san francisco bay coffee folks can temper their ( laudable ) green - focused pod design with some reasonable solution for keeping the coffee fresh for more than a day or so once you open the box . 
=================
never received it i received half of my order , this product was never received . my experience with the product in general is fantastic ; the dogs love it and the time it took them to adjust to their new food was only a few days . it doesn't have an overwhelming smell and it's a fair price .

corgi owners beware i purchased this toy for my four month old corgi ; she absolutely loves it . the only problem is she figured out how to get the bottom off ( where humans fill to bottle ) before she figured out how to use it as designed . so , if you have a corgi or any extremely bright dog , you may want to consider gluing the bottom shut and taking a more difficult approach of filling with treats via the top .

communication between distributors ? communication problem between amazon and distributor , who has what . product great . price great . problem , only half , ( 12 bottles ) of the order showed up after full payment . when inquired at both amazon and manufactuer , i played middle man to resolve the issue . amazon offerd to pay for the other half of the order or i could return the product . i do not want to return the product , its not the product i dont like , just make it happen so that the rest of the order is here timely . end result , i kept the 12 bottles and was refunded the other 12 . product not the problem . not resolving the problem is .

head to the drug store and buy some pretzels . you'll be better off . the presentation is top notch but the quantity and selection of treats is awful . i gave this and a ferrero rocher 48 piece gift box to somebody . their face lit up upon opening the ferrero rocher , but there was no similar face - joy upon opening this gift tower only to find a small bag of popcorn and a couple little handfuls of other bits . also , the ferrero rocher costs less . this gift box set would be a decent deal for $ 5 at a drug store just b / c of the great presentation / packaging . but you could buy its contents for only a few bucks . if presentation is what counts , buy this for sure ! ( i did not sample any of the goods , so i can not comment on quality . )

best tim burton film . he should just stick to this format . in beetlejuice i was entirely sucked into this dream like film . the afterlife was a complete quirk , and if it hadn't been accredited to , i would have known already who had directed it . it felt like batman in it's tone , in its wet darkness , and then the cubistic art world of the urban . i always feel like i'm drawn into the mind of a deeply rooted " pure abstract " painters mind . i love the demensions of his creativity . he takes risks also , something i don't see enough of in his latest works . i always feel like it's halloween after watching this film . in fact it's a sort of tradition to watch this film , along with " a nightmare before christmas " , around halloween time . nothing gets me into the mode better . an ecclectic scare , with a foolishness appropriate enough to remind you of the cartoon . 
=================
more sweet than salty was hopeing it was more salty . the bag opens and rips easily . once open it needs to be poured into a zip lock quart sized bag . some saltiness but more sweet than i was expecting . i'm ordering a different brand next time w / hopes of a saltier flavor . it's good for what it is . . . downgraded because of the poorly designed bag . it can't be resealed and usu makes a mess .

pricey , but may be worth it my 16 year old cat has been eating this dry food exclusively for the past month . he's regained some lost weight and voraciously awaits the next scoop . this food even smells more like " real food " than any other dry cat food i've used .

awesome colors , but note the set # 2 part ! i'll go into more detail as i try the various shades . i lovelovelove gel food coloring ! they don't get funky tasting and not being liquid , it doesn't changethe consistency of the food you are putting them in . that being said , just pay close attention to this listing . truly , i was just looking for a 12 - pc set and thought they were all the same . they aren't ! notice what i didn't notice - set # 2 . the colors listed are exactly what i received , so that part is great . but i was looking to get a base of more basic colors and build on that . i already had black , or i would have been very ticked that it wasn't in this set . ( and it would have been my fault for not reading more carefully ) . so , just pay attention to what colors you are buying in any given listing . they are all good , and i certainly won't return them . however , i also wasn't truly looking for many of the colors in this set .

canceling my shipment i order the 192 box of these every month . i'll get them the same time of the month for a couple of months and then they send me an email that they have canceled my order due to payment problem and i have to reorder and loose a month . i don't understand since i havent changed my address , card number or anything . does anyone else have this problem ?

decafs and iced coffee's fyi . . . . this product came to me with 9 decaf cups and an iced coffee . i did not realize there would be decafs and if so wouldn't have purchased . that being said . . . the other coffees have been great so far and i'm happy to get a sampler before spending my money on a large box .

normandy butter not much to say unless you have tried it , then you will know it's the best butter in the world . 
=================
dry , dry , dry ( but at least it has strong cocoa flavor ) the eat . think . smile rich cocoa chewy granola bars sounded so promising as i like the taste of chocolate and cocoa . the cocoa taste did not disappoint , but the rest of the bar did . this is dry , dry , dry , and even more dry . perhaps these were intended for astronauts in space ? unlike their mixed berry eat . think . smile . chewy granola bars , mixed berry , 7 - ounce boxes ( pack of 6 ) granola bars that were saved by the fruit bits , there are no fruit bits in this one , so it is very dry . eating it with water or milk , or dipping or dunking can help a little bit , but still . i wouldn't throw it away but i wouldn't buy it either . if they fix the recipe , this has promise on the strength of the cocoa flavor . there are five individually wrapped bars in a nicely designed cocoa color themed box . each bar has 160 calories with 4 . 5g of fat ( 0 . 5g saturated , 0g trans ) , 0mg cholesterol , 60mg sodium , 26g carbs ( 3g dietary fiber , 7g sugars ) , 4g of protein , 10 % magnesium , 8 % iron , 4 % vitamin e , 2 % calcium . the back of the box states that one bar has more antioxidant power than a cup of green tea .

mostly chocolate i bought this because i tend to like chocolate coffees . that said , this one was a little too bland for me .

just sugar and salt . if you read the ingredients it says sugar and salt . so , you can buy sugar a salt and sprinkle it on your popcorn for cheaper . i can't believe i bought it !

great product crummy price i started buying cib from this merchant in march because it is sometimes hard to find in the store . my first 2 orders were $ 15 . 90 for the 3 pack , my third order in june was $ 17 . 92 was $ 17 . 92 for the 3 pack which was cheaper than my local store . so when i went to reorder today i was shocked that it has gone up to over $ 23 for the 3 pack making it much more expensive than buying it at my local grocery store . so while i love cib amazon will no longer get my business for this great product .

compare price durkee cinnamon sticks , 9 - ounce containers ( pack of 2i have purchased frontier cinnamon with the other supplier durkee cinnamon because cinnamon helps in my neurological problem ms , so i wanted to compare and find out best valu for my money , i found out that frontier cinnamon is as good as durkee ( unless durkee explain me the diffreance ) frontier cost me almost half the price of durkee , and more over durkee's is not returnable as per amazon policy .

got my hopes up for nothing i am in the process of switching over to a meat free diet . i love tom gum soup and i have been making it , with out fish sauce . it's delicious , but i heard that there is actually a vegetarian version of fish sauce that i could use . so i researched and found this . i ordered it immediately , when i recieved it i was dismayed to find that it contained msg . a big no , no , for me . i never tried it so i don't know if it tastes good or bad . seeing msg listed as an ingredient was enough for me . 
=================
other flavors are good , but not barbeque ! i bought 3 different flavors as i'm gluten free and they seemed safe . the pb & j was the best although it's kind of expensive when you are getting mostly peanuts but tasted pretty darned good . the almonds w / cranberries is pretty good too ! the barbeque i didn't like at all , they taste strictly like chipotle , you cannot taste any ranch , or barbeque taste . 
=================
bad delivery i haven't tried the ice cream yet , but it was delivered today - all mushy and the ice was nearly melted , there were just a few small pieces of dry ice . . we were at home all day today but our doorbell didn't ring except for another delivery . the box sat on the hot porch . the fed ex office said that the delivery didn't require signature . i'm on a special diet and on social security disability and can't afford to pay this much for ice cream that is nearly ruined ! 
=================
dry , small and quality varies a lot i have had these from trader joes few yrs ago when they carried them . they were big juicy and yummy . navitas ones that got shipped ( had 2 bags ) were small , more bitter than sour and dry . i will be in search ofbetter ones . update : i got the same 8 ounce pack from whole foods . 10 times better . most are juicy , soft and consistent quality . fyi the lot # of whole foods ones is 2521 and one from amazon is 405 . that may explain the dried berries from amazonseller . 
=================

oatmeal and lamb lamb and rice formula was awesome , used it for years without any doggy digestive problems . the photo and description on amazon are wrong now though . amazon is currently shipping out the new oatmeal and lamb formula which my dog cannot eat because of digestive issues with oatmeal .

sugar sauce this sauce is fine for small children to dip chicken nuggets in . it's basically karo syrup with some soy sauce added . nothing personal mr . yoshida , but this is just another reason that americans are overweight . we love anything that's just too sweet .

woodstream mole trap product is as advertised . only objection is that it takes strong hands and above average caution to set the traps .

remember how much you're going to have to pay to ship this to the uk ! the cow tales themselves are as delicious as i remember . when i bought them the price i was given seemed a little expensive but ok . i carefully checked the bill and duly paid for them only to discover i'd been charged another whopping 30 + p & p without any prior notification . all i can say is 'buyer beware ! 
=================
okdogyfood i bought this food needing to change my older dogs food for health reasons . dog has yeast issues , thinking grain is the problem i researched grain free dog foods , found this as good average grain free food plus the price was even better than most other . but with more research i now know that starch is worse than carbs and unfortunatly this food has potato in it but my dog really took to this food well and she would not eat the starch free at all . i did not have enough of this food to wean her off correctly to the new food so i had to get more of this food and i am getting her more aquainted with the new food . i think this food would be great for a younger more active dog mine is almost 14yrs old , she still gets good excersize just not as intense as she used to . she is german short hair so when shes out sniffing and eating on all sorts of things this to could be a problem . i trust this dog food company on a whole so don't be afraid to by this , their food line is above average . check out dog food adviser online for comparison shopping and recalls . peace . . . . .

it was a must for us we had to use this formula b / c my son ended up with serious gi issues , and this was the only thing he tolerated . he was ( is ) sensitive to milk , soy , and wheat - this breaks those proteins down to a digestible / tolerable form for him . we did have issues with the vanilla flavored one , which appeared in the form of spitting up more , and was confirmed when he had other foods with vanilla in them . if your kids has any food sensitivities , could be anything , not just the common ones ! also , our doctor gave us samples to see if it would work , after having tried about 4 other formulas . 
=================
too expensive i love cerelac . this price is too much though . they sell these at korean stores for $ 4 , 99 - $ 5 . 99 . go to hmart grand mart
=================
not a rip off ! ! ! to the person who states that the price is a rip off . . . if you can read you would see that amazon offers a six pack and if you can also multiply you would also know that six times three is eighteen . . . i love the taste and the fact that there are whole grains , plus soy , so i dont have to use milk , also there is honey and cane juice included so there is no need to add sugar either . . . 
=================
zoe olive oil we bought it through amazon . it's seems to be very strong , but to us it tastes rancid . it spoils pour salads .

the kiwi slices are not sugary i have ordered this product many times . i have eaten many bags of these . the dried kiwis are not sugary . they do taste like kiwis . i don't know what the other reviewer is talking about . i am addicted to these and to the dried cantaloupe . 
=================
light light on flavor this product needs to taste more like coffee . it is very light on flavor and aroma . it needs to be robust enough to handle a decent shot of half and half .

good intro to sushi . just tried my hand at sushi making for the first time with this kit . one mistake i made was that i did all the rice for my first time ; which ended up being more then i wanted to make . i also will have to disagree with the book which says it only takes 5 minutes of de - starching / washing the rice . it took me an hour of constant washing to get it clear . the sushi book isn't really the best for recipes , at least the ones i like . it also suggests using items like turkey / chicken ; which , seems too strange for me to even bother trying . the texture and flavor do not make sense for sushi .

lipton to go stix need to go somewhere else ! these are convenient to carry in your purse or pocket , but i expected them to taste more like green tea and less like fruit juice . i didn't care for them at all .

they lose a star for having so many types of sweeteners . . . we tried this recently . i have to say i was pleasantly surprised . first off , i am allergic to aspartame , so most of the great flavors of drink mixes out there arealready off my radar . after living in a place with nasty ol' well water for a few years , i developeda soda habit that i am trying to break . i've tried plain tea , don't care much for it , so looked fora decent flavored tea that i didn't have to boil water for ( partially disabled , and no stove , etcwhere i am most of the time ) . last time at the store , i saw these . the package is a little deceptive , so be aware ! that " five calories " is not even for one whole bottle of water - it is for half of a bottle of waterwith one packet mixed in ! i guess they didn't want to post double - digits of a whopping ten calories , but that's what it is for one packet . the sweeteners are three kinds - honey , sugar and sucralose . why they needed three , i do not know . it actually ends up being a little too sweet . i make it , them dilute it with more water thanit technically needs . not sure why lipton can't just make something all natural , or use stevia , which has no effect onblood glucose . they seem to be hesitant to use it for some reason , but i don't know why . they have noproblems loading up the other drinks with chemical sweeteners , but avoid stevia ! weird . . . i have had a lot of problems with my throat swelling up this week , but i have been sick . i am not sureif it is related to the illness , or because i've been drinking this tea almost exclusively for the lastfew days . aspartame makes my mouth , tongue and throat swell up , which is why i read every label now . not sure if the sucralose is doing anything or not - i would tend to think not , because my lips are notnumb nor is my tongue swollen . still , i'd avoid the sucralose if i could . the flavor is really sweet , but i like it . it is refreshing and tasty . again , a little too sweet for mypersonal tastes , so i " water " it down with lots of ice , and it makes it very good ! it's worth trying . this is the only flavor we've tried so far , but will definitely give the others a shotas well . if it helps me give up soda , then that's even better ! : ) update july 9 , 2012 : well , it has been incredibly hot here in the midwest , with a heat wave that broke all kinds of records . of course , i was drinking a lot of tea . these packets are 10 calories each ( that " 5 calories " on the box refers to halfof one packet ! ) , and i had either one or two packets each day for the last month , perhaps . we also tried the peach flavor now , and i don't care for it , but my husband and son like it better than this one . i had to come back and add to the review because of something kind of odd . now , i am hypoglycemic , so maybe that is part of it , but i have to mention it in case others have this problem . i got this tea originally to help me get away from my pepsi habit . the 24 - oz bottles of pepsi that i buy have 300 calories in the bottle . i make the tea kind of weak , so one packet actually makes closer to 32 ounces of liquid for me - i like the flavor better that way ( just personal preference ) , so by comparison , i am getting just 10 calories for 32 oz , vs the 300 in the 24 - oz pepsi . savings of about 97 % of the calories , which should be a good thing ! here's the kicker - i have been gaining weight since i changed over to the tea ! nothing else has changed . i didn't suddenlytake up eating endlessly , etc , and in fact , have eaten a little less during this heat wave . i put on almost five pounds in the last few weeks of changing over to this tea . now , from a caloric standpoint , it doesn't seem possible . however , i am one of those people who does much better on high - protein , low - carb . if you have a similar type of metabolism / body , then be aware of these little packets ! i think it might be the honey in them creating a non - stop ( because i sip tea all day long to keep cool ) assault on my blood sugars . i've noticed that i feel hungry more often as well too . i normally don't get all that hungry - just have a few hungry days once in a while . with this tea , it almost gives you the munchies . i haven't indulged , so it isn't from extra food . it has to be the tea . again , i have to say that i don't think that everyone will experience this effect , but wanted to bring it up . i think the combo of the three sugars lipton has chosen to use for reasons unknown are having a negative effect for me personally . i still like the tea , but have now been cutting it down even more , to see if i can lessen the effects of the sweeteners . i find it odd to think that i could cut out 590 calories a day ( i usually drank two of those 24 - oz pepsis ! yes , i was bad . . . ) and gain weight . it has to be the way all those sugars are interacting with my system . so , if you are one of those folks who do really well on a low - carb diet , be aware that this tea could cause you to lose progress , or even cause you to gain weight . i have also warned my husband , who tends towards higher blood glucose , to only drink it with meals , never alone like i do . just an important heads - up on what could have been the best thing to happen to tea in a long , long time . lipton - please try making something with stevia , which has no impact on blood glucose levels and has no calories . why put sucralose into your items , when stevia is so much better ? i don't get it - it can't be that much cheaper to use ! and i'd pay more for an item that used stevia . . . what a shame ! 
=================
funny aftertaste we recently took gluten out of my daughter's diet and this is the first gf pancake mix we have tried . my daughter wouldn't eat it and said it had a funny aftertaste . i tried it after she did , and had to agree . the mix itself is very easy to use and cooks up nicely . it just didn't taste like pancakes to us ( even with chocolate chips added in ) . we will try some of the other mixes to see if they have a better taste . 
=================
no salt . vodka taste ? oh yeah . i tried a couple of spoonfuls with this by itself . the first few were like a shot of vodka . . . straight . yeah . . . baby ! all my boyfriend could think and say was " fish eggs " , and " yuck , not me " . where i come from , that just means all the more for me . i got the 4 - pk subscription . it is almost as if there is no salt at all , but the vodka may be strong for some . since i am the only one who has the taste for it in my home , one jar can last for 2 days . by the way . . . not for kids . 
=================
fantastic taste , unfortunate about the msg , though . . . i used to buy the big bags of these and eat them constantly , then i looked at the back of the bag and saw they used msg in the cheddar kind , but not in most of the others . i ate chex mix as a healthy alternative to chips and other junk food so them using something like this basically had me switch over to another snack . you can have your own opinions about msg , but i think it's lazy personally when they don't even have to use it but they do anyways . they did taste great , though . maybe if more people complain about them using msg they'll release a new formula without it . and no , i don't mean take mono sodium glutamate off the label and replace it with yeast extract , or autolyzed yeast extract when it's basically just a different name for msg . i'd buy them again if we got a no msg formula . 
=================
no better flavor however , it took amazon 7 days to even ship the product to arrive in another 7 days after that . i'll check with my local grocer to see if they can special order a case next time . it's been almost two weeks since i placed the order and it's still floating around the us postal system . the package is actually further away from me now then the point of origin ! ! ! 
=================
unusual flavor with a pretty good boost ! i've tried a few of the energy drinks . some are pretty good , some are yuk ! some worked while a lot didn't . now this one , it works . it gave me a good kick in the backside to get me going and tasted pretty good too . it did have an unusual flavor that i can't really describe , other than to say it was something different and i liked it . i only had one can of it to try and its kinda hard to be more specific from just that . i've looked for it in the stores around here where i live in colorado but haven't found any yet . at $ 28 for a 12 pack , that's really high for me and way out of my price range . there's several energy drinks out on the market now and a lot of them are priced far below these . if they bring the price down then i'd think about buying some more to try out . over all , this one gave me a good lift to get me going . it did give me a small dose of the jitters and my hands a minor case of the shakes for a little while at first . or as some people would say , a slight case of the tremors . but that calmed down after a little while and i got a lot more done around here than i usually do . i suppose that jittery feeling and shaking hands , or tremors , would go away if you used this regularly and got used to it . i don't have any problem with recommending this no fear , super energy supplement . except for people that have high blood pressure . this could cause your blood pressure to go up from a little to a lot . so be sure to check it a few times when you first use this or any other stimulant . 
=================
wouldn't have believed it if i hadn't tried it myself ! i kept reading recommendations for valrhona cocoa powder and what a difference it makes in baking . frankly , i thought the recommenders were embellishing a bit . . . . until i tried it . i have only found it online and at gourmet food stores and since using it in baking recipes , i will never use any other cocoa powder . it is truly the difference between a good product and an outstanding one . i ran out of valrhona in the middle of making cupcakes for a wedding shower and rushed back to the gourmet shop for some more , they were out of it and sold me a " comparable dutch processed " cocoa . it was not even close to being a good substitute for the valrhona . i will not run out of it again . if you haven't tried it , do yourself a favor and get some ! 
=================
poor quality i carefully read all the reviews on this item before ordering ! i must say , there are not that many real tea drinkers writing reviews for this particular item . sure , if you are a lipton dipper , this is a great tea . but if you know what a quality tea should offer , you would not have given this product more than 2 - stars . the aroma when first open the bag , is quiet decent , but when the tea is brewed , the flavor is a disaster . it is basically a lipton like flavor . the color , is also unlike a good quality earl - gray ! which it should have an amber color , that can be anywhere from light , to deep end of the spectrum , depending if the tea is a single body , or need to be mixed with another tea for potentiation of color . at last , the tea leaves are not uniformly sized , which basically means this tea is probably a mixture of low quality teas , just flavored as earl - gray ! coffee bean direct should consider offering a better tea , for a few more $ $ $ ! ! ! at least 2lb of tea would be worth brewing ! 
=================
good deal if you use it quickly / dates too close for me the purchase was made thinking it would be a great deal for bulk purchase . dates on the product were too close unless you are a user that would finish up in a 2 - 3 week period .

4 greasy slim jim minis per pack - dog loves 'em these were to be my guilty pleasure ; haven't had a slim jim in years . the " mechancally separated chicken " as the 2nd ingredient is a little bit unappetizing in light of the " pink slime " enlightenment . they also contain wheat and soy . these are much greasier than i remember , so my dog got to sample them . my fur - baby loves them and will get the rest of the minis for treats .

as in all cases , size matters i received 3 1 ounce travel tins labeled as 4 ounce tins . be careful that you aren't paying $ 90 a pound . amazon was great and refunded the purchase price , but i think tempest has some major supply problems .

swampy ! smells like a peat bog . my officemate complains every time i drink it . and it doesn't taste all that great , so i don't often . 
=================
bog standard green tea and extortionate price before i begin to review this product let me clarify one thing ; i love green tea and and have tasted many different teas of various types . this tea is little better than something you would buy from tetley or any other bog standard tea purveryor who spoil what should otherwise be a noble and fine beverage something to enjoy as you contemplate the wonder and miraculous nature of your own radiant god like presence : - ) this tea is exactly that - mediocre at best with questionable quantities of reishi the much lauded medicinal mushroom used as a unique selling point . and the price they ask for this tea further exacerbates matters - i dont know about you but if i pay on average $ 1 . 50 per tea bag providing one cup of tea which tastes like something you would get at aldi or lidl then need i say more ? buy something else until organo gold get their act together and stop ripping people off with their cheap tea and fancy packaging which probably costs more than the tea itself ! 
=================
not gluten free the beans are great according to my daughter , i had to give them to her . unfortunately they contain wheat and i eat gluten free . sad face . just letting y'all know since that isn't listed up above in the ingredients .

soup can contains " small amount " of bpa while shopping at costco recently , i tried one of the free samples of amy's lentil soup . i was really surprised at how delicious it was so i bought a pack of it . when i got home , my very health - conscious daughter asked me if i checked to see if it had any bpa in the lining of the can . i said that i had not . today i spoke with a customer relations person at amy's kitchen and asked her if amy's soup cans had any bpa . she told me that they had a " small amount , " but that they were testing other cans and should have no bpa in them by next fall . what i've read is that no amount of bpa is good for you and even a small amount might cause all sorts of bad things in one's body ( cancer , heart problems , etc . , etc . ) . i'm not trying to point the finger at amy's products in particular , just make people aware that even certified organic foods can be packaged in unhealthy containers and consumers should be aware of this .

thanks for identifying a problem my dogs have been eating these treats for some time now , and although they love them , they are starting to show the symptom identified by the fda . naturally i am discontinuing them immediately . here is the fda warning .

smoked oysters these oysters are what i would consider middle to lower quality . it really sucks that they are from china , the price was right , after all you get whay you pay for . 
=================
perfect taste but texture was pretty bad i was really disappointed with this mix . while mixing it , the consistency was just right , and the taste was perfect , there was a hint of maple . i added a little vanilla and i was so excited about the taste . after i made them , my mom tried one before i did and she spat it out and told me it still wasn't cooked all the way in the center . . so i tried one and found the same issue . then the next batch , i left on until they were more golden brown and crispier , and they were still very dough - y in the center . it was like eating raw dough . the only thing i really liked was the flavor , with maple syrup it was wonderful , because i made myself eat them not wanting to waste money . i usually love king arthur gf flour - i think it's amazing . i use it to bake a lot of regular things and substitute it for regular flour , but this pancake mix was a real letdown . i hope others have more luck than i did . 
=================
so far , so good . . . but found elsewhere for less $ $ $ ! put it in my pantry tonight , and it caught 2 moths within 15 minutes , so something is working ! that being said , i actually bought this at home depot for only $ 5 . 78 + tax ! this really casts doubt on amazon's claim that the list price is $ 11 . 11 . . .

for my sister i purchased this for my sister while sitting in the nicu with her and her newborn twins . she had been pumping trying to get her milk to come in so it could be provided for her 32 weekers : ) she was very nervous as she had poor supply with her first child and now to try it with two , it seemed a challenge to say the least . i searched nearby stores to try and find this supplement as it came recommended from several sources . i was unable to find it in our immediate area and so i went to " old faithful " amazon and found it here . i was pleased to locate it , but it didn't take a few days longer than i would have liked , although ordering them on my account and being able to have them shipped directly to her was convenient as we live in different states . i thought the price was a dollar or two higher than what i desired to pay , compared to other supplements for health . nursing women is a positive thing for baby and mom and so making these supplements a bit more affordable may be something to consider . all in all , i would recomend this product and seller , but i would still search for it at a slightly lower cost , if tie was not an issue .

fabulous tasting coconut water . . . not unnaturally sweet in the larger cans . yes , too sweet and awful in the small cans . i was leery of trying the amy & brian's again after having this experience : amazing pulp - free tall cans . horrible candy - water 10 oz cans . so , i have several cases of the short cans i refuse to drink . awful . but i went through the cases of the tall cans . wonderful . i wondered if the inconsistencies would show up in the tall cans , and i did not reorder . then . . this big sale and sub / save showed up . tempted me . i ordered two cases of this one , with the pulp . wonderful . i like it even better than the pulp - free ( which is weird , as i normally avoid pulp - containing packaged coconut water ) . i even found myself enjoying chewing the bits of pulp . the flavor is not too sweet , very nicely coconutty , not at all sour or weirdly salty like the new zico , nicer than one and vitacoco . so , i feel free to order more now . clearly , there is some issue with the smaller cans . i strongly recommend you avoid those like the plague . they taste nothing like coconut water . they taste like you dropped some generic sugar candy in water and let it dissolve . really icky sweet and not at all coconutty . ( i have had fresh out of the shell coconut water since childhood , my family being from the caribbean , and have tasted virtually every brand available locally and on amazon , and i know coconuts vary according to region and even harvest areas etc . coconut water is variable , so i don't expect homogeneous flavor . i do expect it to be coconut water and not candy water ( or corn cereal milk like new zico ) ) . so , yeah , avoid small cans . amy & brian really need to look into why that stuff is disgusting , cause it's ruining their reputation whenever someone tastes that horror . the tall cans : yes , buy these . i've sampled out of four different cases sent to me , always good . the pulp - free was more sweet compared to the tetra pak cw's i've tried , and the higher carb count makes sense . i even emailed the a & b people about it , and they said it was due to the blend / selection of coconuts that theirs is sweeter with a higher carb count . i can see how the selection could do this . i like the sweeter flavor , personally , but always have with meals cause it is higher carbs . when i want to drink coconut water by itself - - i choose a lower carb variety , like original zico was or one in a smaller quantity than the 17 . 5 ounce can . thumbs up . refreshing , sweet , coconutty , lovely . i love , love , love this coconut water in the tall cans . but i beg the amyy & brian folks to investigate and revamp the processing for the smaller cans . that stuff is vile and i have two cases plus sitting in my kitchen that i cannot drink . ( add that to the zico i can't stomach and preordered and that's a lot of my money going to waste cause companies can't get it right / screw with a tried - true formula ) . happy sipping !

very disappointed ! ! i ordered these based upon the fact that i needed them quickly ( through amazon prime ) and the customer reviews were great . the box was white and not red , but was still nice . the bow and tag was missing , and the glue clump was still left that held it in place . the tape that closed the box was dirty - i had to take it off , and luckily , it peeled off easily . i was able to open the box and observe the contents . the crepes were wrapped in a separate interior container . the containers were cheap , brown flimsy plastic holders and several of the crepes were broken . i am ashamed to give this as a gift , but have no choice . i can't understand the high price on these ! i think it is the outer box as it seems to have a magnetic closure . 
=================
bought mine at walmart the ones at walmart is 2 one half pound cups , this one is 2 1 pound cups , idk why so much bad reviews when they cant read . yes the walmart one is 10 bucks and this one is 25 , but this is dubble the candy .

turkey flavor cats are liking this flavor . cans arrived dented so 4 stars instead of 5 . wellness is a healthy food to feed .

torani = great , but torani chocolate = poor i use sugar - free torani syrups all the time , and chocolate is one of two i cannot recommend ( the second is coconut ) . the taste is chemical , not chocolate - flavored at all . be forewarned : this syrup will not satisfy your chocolate craving .

no plum taste , just full of salt this is very cheaply created umeboshi and no true taste . it has uncured runny meat , just full of salt . obviously it was not sundry - typically at least for 7 days which will shrink the meat more compact and has to be cured for 6 month or more with each shiso - wrapped in ceramic barrel . that's the way it's done in true japanese umeboshi which bring out great sour flavor in the first bite as well as true health benefit of umeboshi and will not have the taste of salt . my family or many of people who really know how to make umeboshi in japan , will cure umeboshi for at least one year and some are up to seven years . you only eat the one from the prior year harvest not from the same year harvest . most of health benefit of umeboshi can only be true in well cured umeboshi of 6 month minimum , otherwise you get the symptom of uneasy , queasy stomach taste . normally children are advised not to have more than one umeboshi for this reason . hope eden people rework on how to make umeboshi properly .

it's cheap , and it's bad for your cat . i was raised in a house that always had at least one cat being fed meow mix . owning my own cat now , i've done some research on available food choices . meow mix is one of the cheapest - - and one of the worst . not quite like humans , cats will eat until they are nutritionally satisfied * or * full . the problem with cheap brand cat foods is that they use synthetic products , carbohydrate - based fillers , and processed meat by - products . cats are obligate carnivores . the first two ingredients on meow mix's list ( the ones used in most abundance in the product ) are corn . as a result , cats are getting fewer needed nutrients per serving , causing them to eat until they get full and to eat more over the course of the day . healthy food results in a healthier cat . weight control , shedding , disease development , and more are all influenced by a cat's food . the excessive use of carbohydrate - based fillers in cheap cat foods , as part of this reality , can lead to weight gain and a higher risk of diabetes . many cat owners use meow mix without experiencing some of these problems - - but very few will use it without noticing * any * of them . brands sold in quality pet stores start with iambs as the " baseline , " and even iambs isn't what i'd call good for your cat . many of my local shelters feed their cats iambs as the least expensive acceptable cat food . even better , companies such as orijen and evo make premium cat foods made with very little or no grain content , which are ingredients cats would not naturally eat . whatever you decide , check the ingredients list . make sure some kind of meat is listed as the primary ingredient with other meats as close to the top of the list as possible . also make sure those are actual meats . meats are better then meat meals , and meat meals are ok ( and usually unavoidable ) . meat by - products are what you want to watch out for . the reality is that your cat is not biologically designed to eat a diet consisting mostly of corn or grain . healthy cat food is more expensive , but your cat will eat less of it , helping to mitigate the cost a bit . i recommend premium cat foods for this reason . they're better for your cat in every conceivable way , and they won't break your bank . even if you are on a budget , consider the cost medical concerns due to obesity or diabetes could incur . if you are currently using this food , maybe it's time to switch .

read what you are buying those that purchased this item and couldn't understand the product description shouldn't be buying things on the internet . no where does it say about recieving two boxes of coffee ! i understood the very first time i read it ! i would have loved , loved , loved ! to have been the banker that sold you your mortgages ! i don't think amazon is going to post this , but at least i got to vent !

smell of the year ! i've been using this deodorant for 2 years now . i am a person that shops by smell when buying deodorant , so other features don't matter much to me . i first got a small sample of this deodorant and brought it along on my vacation . i came back associating my vacation with the smell of this deodorant . it smells amazing and reading the other reviews here , i felt compelled to write my bit in agreement . when i put this deodorant on , i feel like it would last until the end of the day . i would never have to worry about re - application ( " 24 hour protection " ) . it gives you confidence and makes you feel good knowing that you smell great , not to mention that it is composed of 1 / 4 translucent moisturizer ( " smoother underarms in 5 days . go sleeveless ! " ) .

good they are good for what they are . like others have said , they're filling . they don't taste that great , but doesn't taste bad either . have some water nearby when eating these , as they will make you very thirsty . my friend shoved a hand full in his mouth and that was definitely a bad idea . made his mouth so dried that he started coughing and gagging .

it is not cheap to buy it here anymore ! ive used blue buffalo for last 3 years ! . amazon has change and prices and availability . . . i . e . they no longer sell 30lb . end tge price no is high ! ! i just bought same product ( 15lb ) at petsupplies . com for a total price of $ 31 . 79thats more than $ 11 difference and it got here very fast ! . . . your welcone ! ; )

new smaller size but same price anyone notice that kashi golean just lost some weight ? new box size is 13 . 1oz rather than 14 . 1oz guess they figured 7 . 1 % decrease in size would be more economically - friendly than a 7 . 6 % price increase ( the math here is a bit tricky but this is the true increase in price ) . # 8 / 29 / 12 # price has returned back to old price . 
=================
good toast chips old london melba toast is good tasting if you like small pieces . it is packed loosely in the box and so far out of 6 boxes i've only found two slices not broken into pieces . nothing like paying high dollar for toasted bread that is basically small pieces when you open it up . they definitely need to work on their packaging .

please cancel our auto ship great product . . . but we do not need the auto ship at this time . i have tried to cancel this auto ship but have been unable to find the tab . please send me an email confirmation that the auto ship has been cancelled . thank you

too much of a " not so good thing " i wish i had not ordered in bulk . the recipe ( for cornbread ) came out bitter - tasting , and the only " new " ingredient was the flour , so i assumed that was the cause . i'm not sure , and i hate to " blame " this product , but i am hesitant to use it again and i have so much of it ! it would be great if we could get " trial " sample or variety packs of some of these products !

its not cereal , its raisin ! the boxes that i got had more than 50 % raisins . in an average spoonfull of cereal , i got about ~ 4 raisins , which is pretty high . so , if you are looking for a box of raisins rather than cereal , go for this .

yorkshire gold tea i came across this tea in the grocery store just a few days after reading all the great reviews here , so i had to buy a box . but now that i've tried it , i have to ask : are we drinking the same tea ? because this tea has no aroma and very little flavor , and i would rate it below lipton's , if you can believe it . my recommendation for a great black breakfast tea is numi's morning rise breakfast blend , available in some stores and also here on amazon .

too pricey plus very difficult to open i have two cats . one cat loved this all natural grilled tuna ; the fussier one tried to bury it . there were two things i didn't like about the product . first , the zippered plastic envelope was very difficult to open . ( i ended up placing it in a different sealable bag . ) second , it was very pricey : almost $ 10 for just over 4 oz compared to about $ 1 for a 5 oz can of tuna at a grocery store . i tried the product because it was available to me at no charge through the vine program . despite the fact that my one cat loved it , i would not pay full price for it myself . ( sorry , kitty ! ) 
=================
don't do it . greenies addiction is very real . the treats are nutritious and any cat will go bonkers over them . the downside is that your cat may very well stop eating his regular food . my cat litterally begs for greenies and even wakes me up when i'm sleeping . when i don't give him any , he goes off and mopes until he decides to try again . this whole issue has caused a lot of tension in our relationship , and i've decided to just go cold turkey . i just cancelled a $ 60 order of the treats . i want back my cat that loves me . . . not the one who goes through the motions until i break down and give him treats . he no longer displays real affection . many , many people give their cats these treats , but do some searching online and you will see stories similar to mine . they don't call it " kitty crack " for nothing . best of luck .

deceiving , a pity , really . . . well , back to mama noodles we go . . . i had high hopes when my friend i was visiting in portland was using these for a quick long - day - at - work meal - between - meals . then i read the label . hydrolyzed soy protein . not only is soy already bad for your health beyond a quick - reached 10g a day " healthy moderation " level , but hydrolyzed soy ( hydrolyzed " vegetable protein " almost always being soy , too ) is full of msg . it's not alone - - autolyzed yeast , corn - sourced maltodextrin ( which is nearly all maltodextrin anymore ) , the list goes on , but in short they are all msg . . . only unlike europe , america does not require that special " enhancer " code for various food additives and we as a result have to constantly be stealthy ( thanks , monsanto ) . so that said , i did taste a bit of it , trusting his comment of no msg ( it makes my head and stomach both feel like a vice grip is being tightened on them ) . . . and as i am sensitized to the weird not - salt flavor of it , i stopped and asked politely to see the package . sure enough , glaring at me is msg . . . for taste , i'd give it 3 stars overall - - the msg taste isn't super - strong , but it is apparent enough to set off all my alarms nonetheless , so i couldn't enjoy it . for ethics , it's a miserly negative 10 stars . . .

love this but not at $ 92 ! i bought exactly the same thing today at marshalls for $ 12 . 99 . same company , same thing . absolutely no difference . $ 92 for salt - i don't care what kind of salt it is . . . $ 92 ? ! ! !

these are supposed to be large papers - - in whose world ? everything great thing that has been said about these liners is probably true - - except for the large part . i received my case of liners the day before i had to make 60 large cupcakes and was i ever surprised when i saw that they are only little more than an inch tall ! so , here i am scrambling to find something else to use at the last minute and won't be able to do so without driving 75 miles each way . then , what to do with 1 , 440 cupcake liners i don't want ? can't return them .

very large berrys , just not as tasty as they look the berries were packaged very well . they looked just like the photos on the site when i pulled them out . the berries were so large , that my guests were cutting the berries in half so they could eat them . that is when i noticed that the chocolate coating started falling off the berries . the chocolate will also start falling off if the berries are left out on the table for to long . i glade i got them but i do not see myself buying them again .

cashew butter i was not able to stay away from eating this as soon as i opened the jar . this is good product , thanks
=================
larger bottle is diluted i ordered the 2oz bottle as opposed to the . 5oz bottles , and it was very diluted . a couple family members of mine use it and buy it in the smaller bottles . it's like each bottle has the same amount of sucralose and otherwise is just diluted with water . my favorite product is sweetzfree that can be bought at sweetzfree . com . it's consistently sweet ( almost too sweet , but you can dilute your own to your liking ) . it's more expensive but is still a better value because of the amount more sweet that it is . to quantify it : to equally sweeten something , you would need 8 drops out of the 2oz bottle of ezsweetz , 4 drops out of the . 5oz bottle of ezsweetz , and 2 out of any sweetzfree bottle ( and sweetzfree is not twice as expensive per ounce ; hence the better value ) . however , ezsweetz is leaps and bounds better , cheaper , and is actually calorie - free as opposed to splenda which is expensive , nasty ( starchy ) , and actually like 200something calories per cup ! that's why it gets 2 stars instead of 1 for inconsistency . hope this review is helpful ! 
=================
tastes like malt balls i love m & m's and i love pretzels , but this combo is nothing special . the chocolate doesn't taste like a regular m & m , it tastes like cheaper chocolate . the whole thing together reminds me of the taste of malt balls . . . . . . . . . it doesn't remind me of a chocolate covered pretzel . i was expecting better . peanut m & m's are way better . 
=================
not for strong coffee lovers gloria jean's butter toffee has just a hint of toffee flavor and not too much bite ( like the bold k - cups ) . it is not as flavorful as other flavored k - cups like german chocolate cake , but it seems to have more flavor than hazelnut or french vanilla . 
=================
very high maintenance this product cannot be cooked more than 1 package at a time , and even then you will need to watch and stir it lot ( be prepared for a workout ) . the consistency is like rice not pasta . so the water becomes milky and if you don't cook it correctly ( which is difficult if you really want it al dente ) , it can be very chewy . the taste does not lend itself to authenticity . i wish i had not bought it and am stuck with the other packages : ( 
=================
why so pricey - is the quantity wrong ? this is a great product , but it and others like it ( starbucks doubleshot energy drinks , monster java etc ) are more than twice the price of supermarket retail and don't include shipping . what the heck is going on ?

unhealthy ingredients chicken by - products , wheat gluten , meat by - products . not for my dog . the problems with meat by - products are that they may include indigestible or poorly digested parts of the animal ( think hair , beaks , hooves , teeth , etc . ) and it may include outdated meats from markets . dogs can handle the outdated meat fine , but the problem is in the packaging . one report i read said that some styrofoam from meat trays gets inadvertently included with the meat at the dog food factory . it is then very finely ground with the meat , with unknown effects on your pet . finally , dogs don't digest wheat gluten ( a thickening agent ) . wheat gluten from china has , in the past , included highly toxic melamine . the source for ingredients isn't on iams pet food cans . sometimes you get far less than you pay for . dogfoodadviser rates canned iams at 2 out of 5 , " below average for canned dog food " at [ . . . ] . the price certainly is above average for canned dog food .

boy , should you read the disclaimer ! there's a very good reason for the disclaimer on this website . these pumpkin seeds are imported from china ( ! ) by a company called yankee traders . ignore the fact they're called " pepitas " which made me think they might be from mexico , if imported ( which wasn't mentioned , either ) . then there's the label which mentions that these seeds are processed in a facility that " also processes products containing peanuts , tree nuts , soy , fish , milk , egg , crustacean shellfish and wheat ingredients . " i'm not allergic to any of those , but nonetheless after consuming about a half cup of these as a snack in the afternooon and at bedtime , i woke up with a headache , upset digestive system and other unpleasantness . considering all the accusations regarding poisoned pet and for - human products that are chinese - grown , made or processed , which have been in the news over the last few years , i can't help but worry about these seeds . i guess that's what i get for not wearing my glasses to examine the label carefully before consuming a new product . so much for healthy snacking - - you shouldn't buy these if you do have allergies , or if you have concerns about chinese food - related imports . 
=================
good enough for a light snack this are skinny little chew sticks . since i have a big dog who's an aggressive chewer , they don't last very long , but she likes them . of course , this is a creature who will eat cat poop so she doesn't exactly have a discriminating palate .

peanuts weren't up to parr ! ! ! my husband has eaten the superior nuts for a long period of time and was thrilled to find out he could get the large cans on amazon . com . he has always thought superior were the best peanut you could get , but this time they were hard and tasted a bit old , even though the date on the can indicated they weren't . needless to say , he won't be buy anymore superior nuts , especially on line . linda miller

raw revolution chocolate and cashew bar a decent product and great on the go , but the taste is terrible . the chocolate raspberry is a little better than the cashew and chocolate bar , but only a little better . the lara bar is a much better tasting raw food bar .

hit and miss - mine was a miss it seems like whether or not this ( or any of the other crazy cups samplers ) are worth it depends on the day and who packs your orders . i wasn't one of the lucky ones - over half of what i received were a vanilla flavor . sure , i've got vanilla cappuccino , regular vanilla from three coffee manufacturers , vanilla iced - coffee , decaf vanilla . . . i assume they were out of the other flavors that day and substituted all vanilla . quite a disappointment since i was hoping to try a variety of flavors before deciding what to order . 
=================
love it , so far . i received this as a christmas gift . last night i wanted to try it out . so i tried making some carrots . the steaming portion seemed to work great . it kind of put a lot of water in the carrots , though . once it came time to process , all it did was make noise . the blades did not spin at all . my husband and i tried taking it apart and putting it back together , but it still would not work . i have contacted the manufacturer today . hopefully , they will replace it . overall , it was really disappointing . i really wanted it to work . it's a nice looking little machine . it takes up very little counter space and it has little suction cups on the bottom so it stays in place . i really hope i can get a new machine . * * update * * after calling the manufacturer and leaving a message ( i got the voicemail ) i was promptly called back . the woman on the phone explained to me how to open the bottom of the machine and reattach the belt ( she claimed that it would not void the warranty ) . according to her , the way fed ex was shipping the machines is causing the belt to come off inside . unlike the other reviews , i found the manufacturer to be quite helpful and very nice . i only have a few issues with it , so far . the blade is difficult to remove after it is done processing . you have to turn it and pull kind of hard at the same time . this is difficult to do after steaming because it gets pretty hot . i also noticed brown liquid leaking out from the bottom of the canister . i am assuming that it is lubricant from the drive shaft . it's not getting into the food , but it is annoying . other than that , i have no other problems . it's actually a lot of fun to use .

tofu shirataki noodles i first heard about shirataki noodles years ago and decided i would try it . i went to fiesta and got these tofu shirataki noodle . shirataki are made from konjac yams and the added tofu gives it a harder texture . the noodles without tofu added is 0 calories . the one with tofu is 20 cal per 4 oz which is low in cal . i always rinse the noodles first . i never cook it longer than 3 minutes . the first time i ever made shirataki noodles i cooked it like regular pasta and it turned into a gel - - this was years ago . i learned that was the worst mistake to make and changed how i make these noodles . the next time i made it correctly and tried to eat it with pasta sauce . that didn't work for me , since the flavors did not merry and i was accustomed to the hard texture of pasta . the noodles are similar to the texture of vermicelli rice noodles . i personally prefer it in soups and not as a substitute for spaghetti . i would sometimes eat it with a sauce i make with soy sauce , shredded ginger , chili paste , and sprinkle green onions on top for looks . i have tried this rinsed without it being cooked and it has no flavor whatsoever . it isn't like ramen noodles which as a flavor without anything added . even though i still eat the tofu shirataki , i just got the one without tofu and it is very similar . the one without tofu is 0 cal which is a plus . update : i did some more research on shirataki noodles in order to expand my ideas with recipes . i found that the reason that my shirataki noodles may have turned into mush was because it expired . it seems shirataki noodles is still good for a year and even after it is still edible however it would turn to mush if cooked too long . these noodles also apparently shrink and become thinner , something it seems some people like . i went to the store that i used to get my tofu shirataki noodles , and looked at the for an expiration date . lo and behold , it was expired by over a year . i even saw some in the store expired by over 2 years . it seems that non expired shirataki noodles will become alot more chewy if cooked too long . my mom used it in stir fry , and i have also tried it baked which is also a great idea . i been lazy and not just use any boullion cube with the noodles and that works fine . . . i just let it sit in the seasoning for a few hours to take the flavor of the soup . 
=================
amazing ! woah . . . wasn't expecting this to be as good as it is , honestly . when mixed with water , the consistency is a dead ringer for regular peanut butter and the taste is spot on . i was expecting bland , chalky paste but it definitely is nothing like that . mmm ! so good ! excited to try it in / on everything ! ! if you're on the fence , just give it a try . for way under $ 10 , and way under the regular fat content of regular peanut butter , this stuff is a god - send !

misses the mark i switched our 10 week old kitten from science diet kitten to wellness kitten because she had the runs from the 1st day we adopted her . the shelter first said she never had diarrhea , then admitted she got the runs when she was spayed 2 days before we picked her up . so we are dealing with the unknown . two stool tests were negative so we feel this might be food - related . this kitten was also being fed wet food with the kibble ( purina pro plan kitten ) i did some online research and decided to stop the dry food as it contained grains which is very bad for the runs . and i also stopped the wellness dry as it has grains . the diarrhea has lessened , but it's been 2 weeks now & i'm still stumped . i did add some dry baby rice cereal into her canned food , and also include a capsule of probiotics ( spread out over 4 daily meals ) . she had a more formed stool today , so maybe she's turning the corner . i also question wellness putting vegetables / fruits in this kitten food ! these are not foods cats would eat in the wild . is this just another company trying to make a buck off us by putting in things we know are good for human health ? that would be the ultimate con job . i truly don't think cats need to eat fruits & veggies , so wellness is fast going to the bottom of my feeding list of good foods for cats . in fact , almost all cat food companies put out junk food for our beloved forever friends ! i will continue to try to find something more appropriate for this kitten , and another kitten , adopted a week later , from a different litter ( and w / no digestive issues - she was / still is being fed petsmart brand authority wet & dry - the dry contains grains / corn , but i won't switch her as her digestion works great on it ) wellness came highly recommended to me , but my search for a grain - free / veggie / fruit - free / wheat - free kitten dry kibble continues . . . . so wellness kitten kibble is off my list . i will try their canned kitten formula but not easy to find thus far .

the pride of sanger my wife is from fresno and brought this into the marriage . the big country - style ak - mak is ten times better than the little crackers . break off a chunk the size of a credit card , spread it with unsalted butter , and cover it with a vegetable - peeler shaving of romano cheese . serve it to a room full of church ladies and they'll body - check each other into the boards to get the last piece . at amazon's price for the country style , it's way cheaper than triscuits . and i'd much rather give the money to the soojians than to nabisco .

beery flavor 17oz i have to admit , personally this wasn't very good . i tend to gag ( very slightly though ) so don't get me wrong ! some people may not agree . for those who prefer taste , i would skip on this and go with the other flavors like chocolate . i don't know what it is . . i find it kinda bland . even when mixing it with other juices . i give this 4 out of 5 . minus one star cause of the bitter / dirt flavor or something i can't explain it . i would rather drink / buy the 15 , 000 orac or chocolate flavor .

my lab just ate the whole thing ! omg , i gave this to my 1 year old , 110 lab and he ran outside with it . i got distracted and when i went to check he had already eaten the entire thing . the only thing i could find were two horrible splinter pieces ! ! now i'm at this moment terrified ! ! ! i read the other reviews where some dogs have had to have surgery because of these . . . i'm hoping and praying my dog will be okay . it's only been a hour since it happened and now all we can do is wait and watch . i've given him some bread and he gets pumkin every night anyway . plus he had already eaten his dinner so i'm hoping his " full " tummy will help the bone to pass . needless to say my husband is mad at me for not showing it to him before i handed it out . but we've been going through some major life issues the last couple of weeks and i'm not thinking clearly as it is . i soooo wish i could turn back time and have never given it to him ! ! please stay away from this bone and please , if you are reading this and have any good thoughts to help while i wait , i'm open to them as i am worried sick ! ! ! i've already lost my 14 year old lab in sept and this one we got in oct and he his my angel ! ! ! i would die if anything happened to him ! ! !

what happened to the price ? ? ? the price was considerably better a while back at $ 19 . 44 . how can they figure the original price was $ 6 . 30 per bag , when the company who manufacture's this product sells it for $ 3 . 99 per bag plus shipping . for the price they are charging now , i can get it at my local healthfood store for much less . the product is excellent and have used it for many years , but amazon's price is not a deal anymore !

too much trouble seller was fine but cleaning out and refilling used cups is time and labor intensive , lids don't fit all recycled cups and when they do , they often come off and stick in top of the brewer where resides a very sharp needle . we decided that despite our attempts to be frugal and recycle as much as possible , in this case , we will be happy with buying new coffee cups and discarding used .

not as good as before the first few boxes of k - cups were excellent - - strong and rich . the last two boxes i've ordered were completely different - - not nearly as strong . even brewing on the smallest - cup setting doesn't yield a strong cup of coffee . what happened , timothy's ? ? ? i'm guessing timothy's has reduced the amount of coffee in the k - cup . or maybe i got a bad batch . too bad . . . now i have to find another k - cup for my coffee subscription .

great product - terrible price i can buy this at my grocery store for $ 6 a package . it makes the best chocolate cake - you'll never know it's gluten free . but this price is too high . 
=================
out of production ? i assume this product is no longer being made which is kind of sad . i enjoyed it when i was a kid ( about 70 years ago ) and enjoy it now on turkey , chicken and liver sausage sandwiches .

i should move to sardinia didn't really like sardines much till i found these . now i eat them all the time with salad and walnut oil dressing . hope they come back in stock soon .

buy from another retailer for 1 / 3 the price ! this listing sells the freezer tray for nearly $ 50 when all other retailers sell for 19 . 95 . make sure you look before you buy .

this is bogus i can't believe that i have to search for these on amazon . like srsly double u tee eff kellogs ? why can't i buy them at the supermarket like a normal human being ? spoiler aleart : these are the best pop tarts on the planet and all other pastries will taste like chocolate starfish after you have tasted the deliciousness . i miss u wild berry . u never call . i wish you the best . . . but i have to let you go . i don't wanna cloooose my eyes ! no wait ! come back ! i didn't mean to only give u a one star review . . . i was just hurt . that's all . please kellogs give us one more chance to show you how much we love you . you don't have to say anything for now . just think about us . what we had . when you're ready i'll be waiting here for you . . . in the pastry isle . . . at von's . we can watch power rangers together like old times . i know u miss me because i miss you . i'm sorry . i'm drunk texting . don't let things get weird ok ? i hope you the best wild berry . - chris isaac

great bread ! ! bad pricing are you joking about the price ? you can get this at fairway , wholefoods , and other health stores for under $ 5 bucks . so what's the deal with this exorbitant price . it's flat out ridiculous . iwouldn't purchase it here - no way . 
=================
taste great , after effects horrible ! ! ! ! i tasted these and thought they were the just as good as the sugar ones , then , , , about an hour later i was running to a bathroom . my stomach started cramping and making all sorts of noises . i'll leave the rest out . i only want to say , try a sample before you buy a big bag of these . you may or may not have the digestive system to handle this . oh , by the way , i only ate about 10 bears . . .

good for a go around , but probably not the staple snack for charlie the lickety stick is truly a unique product . it's basically a rollerball bottle ( like some deodorants ) with different flavored syrups ( like chicken , beef , or bacon ) . i've never seen anything like it . the promo video says dogs love the taste and it's very low cal ( oddly , the video also warns of an epidemic of pet obesity , which while probably is true , i had never heard it described in such catastrophic and somber tones ) . the treat is on the high price end of what dog treats usaully cost , but the maker boasts each bottle contains over 500 licks . i've been trying to figure out if that's a good deal . normal - sized treat bags don't usually have 500 treats , but on the other hand , you would never just give your dog 1 lick off this thing . if your dog likes the lickety stick ( there are review testimonies here going both ways ) , then it's left up to you how long puppy gets to lick , so the touted cost - effectiveness could quickly evaporate ( there is no recommended serving size on the bottle ) . all in all , the lickety stick reminds me of a sugar free lollipop . they can have a decent flavor , but not everyone will like them ; they don't have calories , so they're " healthier ; " and because they're calorie free , they don't fill you up at all , which leaves me with a final thought . regular dog treats do at least have a substance factor ; they are a solid food . the lickety stick is a calorie free liquid , so the filling factor is missing . and so while charlie did enjoy the lickety stick , she probably won't be getting another one . she is already in great physical condition , eats an organic dog food regimented according to the bag - recommended diet , and is taking c9 vitamin supplements . basically , she gets enough health stuff is what i'm saying ; so when she does get a treat , i want her to enjoy it like the treat that it is . i'm not convinced the lickety stick does that . now , if you are trying to wean your pet off table food or lower their weight , this product could probably help you do that .

has anyone noticed the first two ingredients ? are glucose syrup and evaporated cane juice ? just because these ingredients are organic doesn't mean they're healthy . i worry that we are giving our kids the implied message that sugar is good . we already eat a ton of sugar , as a nation , and i don't have to mention what our obesity rates for kids are . why can't we get a wholesome alternative that doesn't have a ton of sugar in it ?

packing nightmare there was no bubble wrap around the bottles - they were just rolling around inside the large box . only a few air pillows were in there . - lucky they didn't break

skippy natural with honey is way too sweet ! my husband and i eat peanut butter by the spoonsful . we had been buying skippy natural creamy for several years and liked it very much . recently , when i bought it i noticed that it is now skippy natural creamy with honey . i like honey so i thought it would be the same wonderful peanut butter with honey instead of sugar . unfortunately , it is not . instead of replacing the sugar with honey , they have added more sugar in the form of honey . it now has 5 grams of sugars per serving instead of the 3 grams it did previously . and it tastes so sweet now that the sweetness masks the natural peanut flavor . if the old style is not still available at the same price then we will be switching to jif natural .

raisin bran . . uh . . where are the raisins ? i am still a fan of old school cold breakfast cereal , the kind that just needs milk . even as an adult i still love it . i have my favorites , mostly embedded from my childhood and new varieties that are newer to the market . i would say that kellogg's raisin bran would be considered a favorite from childhood . therefore when i saw this new spin on " raisin bran " i was quite interested . this " raisin bran " has the addition of almond slivers and dusted with cinnamon . well i cannot express my disappointment with this cereal . first and foremost the cinnamon , i am not sure i would use the term " dusted with cinnamon " rather " dumped with cinnamon " . this is all i tasted was cinnamon and it was very , very sugary . secondly the almond slivers were pretty much nonexistent , which is sad considering it is promoted on the box . thirdly this is " raisin " bran right ? where are the raisins ? did the two scoops that kellogg's has built their reputation on been reduced to two tablespoon scoops ? the taste itself isn't bad per se , if you love cinnamon . i would rather just have a bowl of normal " raisin bran " . kellogg's did a find job with their " raisin bran crunch " so i am not sure how they dropped the ball on this cereal . and not for nothing , but the box that the cereal comes in itself is very small . this seems to be the case for most companies nowadays smaller packaging , higher prices . but in the case of this cereal there is some major deception . the cereal is supposed to have almonds , raisins and cinnamon . well there are barely any almonds or raisins and tons of cinnamon . so it appears that kellogg's is getting away cheap with this product . simply by charging more , making smaller packaging and skimping on the almonds and raisins and bulking up on cinnamon and bran flakes . i would be really surprised if this product is still on the shelf in six months .

ok if you need gluten free , otherwise i would pass i bought a couple boxes of these ( creamy peanut butter ) when amazon had them on their gold box deals . i was looking for a protein bar to use after strength training workouts and thought i would give these a try after seeing some reviews . wow , i am surprised these get as high of reviews as they do . don't get me wrong , these bars have a place for those who need gluten - free or for those looking for a meal replacement and don't want to feel hungry , but if you are looking for a protein bar , there are much better choices out there that taste 20 times better . i'm guessing there are also better tasting bars out there for meal replacement , but i haven't been in search of that so don't know . these bars are somewhat waxy on the outside ( faux chocolate seems like ) , but i was willing to overlook this as a lot of protein bars on the market suffer from a similar fate . it didn't help that these had overheated at some point in amazon's hands and the outside was chalky but other than looks , this didn't matter so much . the inside of this bar , well . . . . . it just leaves a funky after taste ( distinctly whey protein ) . it wasn't different than the protein bars i had tried five years ago , but it's nowhere near some of the other protein bars on the market . i didn't find the bar disgusting although i've seen reviews on the internet where many people couldn't eat them . i could eat it without thinking it was horrible , but i found at times that i just keep eating and eating and the bar never disappeared . . . seemed a chore to keep eating . it is an extremely filling bar thus why i recommend possibly for meal replacement . since it has 230 calories , it was a little too much for me to eat as a post workout snack . i have found that i can buy pure protein bars that have the same amount of protein and range from 180 to 200 calories however they are slightly smaller bars ( 1 . 76oz ) . the taste of the pure protein peanut bars is the closest thing i've tasted to an actual candy bar without a lot of sugar ( they have 2g ) . i find it hard to believe people say the thinkthin creamy peanut butter bars are like a candy bar . . . . wow , i think perhaps people need to try some other bars for comparison because you don't really know what to expect until you've tried a few others . if you need gluten - free or are looking for a meal replacement , these are ok , but i think you can do better with other products . i'm looking forward to finishing up my last box of these so i can start eating my pure protein revolution chocolate peanut caramel bars and actual enjoy eating them and get less calories with the same amount of protein .

too strong i tried the lemon - lime and is was ok but when i tried the mango , it tasted ok but as i swallowed it , it began to burn all the way down my throat and into my stomach . i did not have this problem with the other flavor and my husband did not have a problem with the mango he drank . perhaps it was a bad bottle . it has been over a week and with eating very bland light meals , my throat is finally feeling close to normal . i'm sure this is a good product , i must have gotten a bad bottle .

save yourself some money save yourself $ 10 and make this at home . you can make your own syrup by combining two parts ( i . e . 2 cups ) table sugar to one part ( i . e . 1 cup ) fresh water and boiling in a pot on the stove for a couple minutes . this will keep in the fridge forever . if it crystallizes just reheat to dissolve . any higher sugar - to - water ratio will likely crystallize too easily , and less will dilute your drinks / recipes .

misleading website celtic sea salt itself is wonderful . we have used it for years . i was very , very unhappy that i clicked on purchasing a 5 # bag of salt as you can see for yourself . what i received was a half pound bag of salt . the company was willing to refund my money , but it would have cost me even more to return it than would have been refunded . i would never , ever trust this company again ! shopper beware !

garlic garlic walnut acres pasta sauce i purchased a 25 . 5 oz . jar of this organic pasta sauce at my local whole foods market . . it contains organic ingredients . each 1 / 2 cup serving is 50 cal . , 280 mg sodium , 1 g fat , 10 g carbs , 1 g fiber , 6 g sugar , & 2 g protein . it has a garlic punch that is very pleasant , but it is low on real flavor . it contains chunks of tomatos and bits of garlic . this is not a thick sauce . it taste much like diet sauces , and it is made from mostly tomato puree ( water & tomato psaste ) . and that's what it tastes like - - water & paste . i give this sauce 1 / 5 for flavor , 2 / 5 for texture / thickness , 5 / 5 for organic integrity , & 5 / 5 for packaging . this sauce will require you to doctor it up to make it palatable .

molasses treats not a hit i wanted to give these cookies a five , but my dog just wasn't fond of them . they look appealing and have a good fragrance . these also aren't crumbly like some cookie treats . i took a nibble and think they're quite tasty . but , just didn't hit the mark with my shih tzu for some reason . 
=================
powdery taste to these chips ~ but my dog likes them ! i love hummus and garlic so i thought these chips would be just right for me . however , i did not like them because they taste like they are made with powder ingredients . the reason for that is that they are actually made with : " garbanzo flour , garlic powder , onion powder , soy flour , potato starch & corn starch " . hence the reason for the powdery taste . yuck ! but the good thing is that my dog likes them , but then she likes everything .

if you really like graham crackers . . . ? newtons fruit thins ( cranberry and citrus ) / b004fej968i was really excited about receiving these cookies through amazon vine - i'm a big fan of the newtons " fig newtons " line of products and always have been . it seemed like a transition to " cookie " would be inevitably good , but . . . these cookies just didn't do it for me or my family . i guess i should have been concerned when my husband bit into one of these and said , " these taste like sand ! " i didn't feel like they were quite * that * bad , but it's true that these are * very * dry and somewhat crumbly . they remind me a little bit of dry graham crackers or dry " nilla wafers " - i ended up dunking these cookies in milk to make them a little more palatable . the dried fruit bits in these cookies are nice , but not anything to really write home about . the cranberry and orange flavoring is very subtle and seems to come across more in the scent than in the actual taste . overall , i like the sweetness balance of these cookies - they're not overpowering , and the flavor is nice - but the intense dryness of the cookie combined with the sticky chewiness of the dried fruit was just too toothsome for me . if the cookie had been softer , i would have liked these a lot more - as it was , i felt like i was eating very dry crackers and i didn't enjoy the experience . i don't like to waste things , so i'll try to finish the entire bag , but the rest of the family has already informed me that i'm on my own . note : this review is based on a free review copy of this product provided through amazon vine . ~ ana mardoll

constipation we switched from the advance similac to the organic product thinking it would be better as we prefer organic foods ourselves . it was a disaster with our 2 month old baby getting constipated and progressively worsening her intake till she fell drastically below her calorie intake . we discontinued the product within five days and switched back to the previous similac and she is fine now . her feeding and calorie intake is back to normal

excellent product . . . until amazon ships it ! i want to start by saying that if i was reviewing the food alone , it would get 5 stars easily . it's a quality product and my picky eater cat ( as in , he would literally rather go hungry for days on end than be coaxed into eating something he doesn't like ) loves it . having said that , i won't buy this ( or any other canned product for that matter ) from amazon . com anymore , unless they were to significantly change their packaging method . normally i only review a product all on its own because other factors are incidental , but this time it seemed fitting to comment on shipping too because it drastically affected the overall quality of the product and is an unavoidable part of getting it to any customer . the product arrives in a small cardboard flat with 2 layers of 12 cans each , then the whole thing is shrink - wrapped in plastic . then they put it in a shipping box and put 3 air pillows on top . exactly 1 / 2 of the cans arrived dented ( the entire bottom tier of the flat ) , many of them so badly that it looked like they had been run over by a car . amazon . com customer service is great and responsive - they shipped the replacement out with complimentary next - day shipping . . . and it arrived in exactly the same condition . in the end , i got everything i paid for , but 1 . do i want to go through this every time i order it ? no . and 2 . it's hugely wasteful because of course the dented cans are unusable because the seal could be compromised , offering the perfect breeding ground for botulism . i can fairly say that this is typcial for canned products in general from amazon , too . i've gotten black beans , kidney beans , chick peas , tomato sauce , and tomato paste from them , and there wasn't one order among them that didn't have the same problem . again , customer service was great and sent quick replacements ( again with a high damage rate ) , but it's not worth the hassle and waste . if it ever occurs to them to pad the entire order and not just the top of it , i'll return to using them because the free shipping and convenience of subscription auto - order ( and subsequent additional savings ) really are nice .

take your dog out to dinner . its cheaper and lasts longer . i see many of the reviews of this product were for puppies . maybe they aer good for puppies , but not for dogs ! ! i purchased 6 quado dog bones . the dogs loved them and devoured them in only an hour . i was disappointed and disturbed that they went so quickly and went back to read the packaging to find a small blurb on the back of the package on the bottom right " quado is to be consumed over a period of time and not in once sitting or even on day . " ( 1 ) i paid about $ 8 for each bone with shipping . this was for a bone which lasted only an hour . i expected it to be a " bone " not a " treat . " i could have taken my dogs out to dinner for that price . ( 2 ) if the bone is meant to be consumed over time , please make that obvious on the front of the package and not in some small print on the back . it worries me now why they printed the statement on the back . i can appreciate the fact that they created environmentally - friendly products and trusted that i would be satisfied with my purchase . i buy the best for my dogs despite not being a wealthy person . i bought these bones because the shape is a great design . i expected a bone that would last . i am disappointed . i would requested a refund for my purchase price . i have yet to hear from the company n - bone .

almost a $ 17 hike in price ? i love this coffee and bought my 3 pack about 2 weeks ago for $ 18 dollars ( as i have for quite some time ) . now it is $ 35 ? what's up ? i am now on the hunt for cheaper - - and can understand a price hike but this is too much at once .

i love this stuff , but this last one i got what a mess . it arrived in the 'ready for shipping box' only the outside of the box was damp in places and the inside was very soaked from the leakage of the creamers . i have had to throw many away and some are not easy to see why they are leaking . for some reason the seal tops are on but not adequately and i go put into my coffee or tea and i get a clump of mucous like substance instead of creamer in my drink . . . another waste . . . that is not going to pass my lips . i love the creamers , love the subscription program as i change flavors and mix and match . . . plus i don't have a refrigerator so please do note this review is for this one delivery only , all other times i have been happy , but they all came double boxed and in good condition and most enjoyable . amazon has never let me down before on my creamer purchases this time just a mishap . . .

if you are a coffee hound go for the dark roast version i love my illy , but after drinking the dark roast version and trying the medium roast i felt like it was a downgrade . keep in mind that i like my coffee strong and the medium roast i could not bear to drink it black . i went back to the dark roast immediately but for the casual coffee drinker you might like it .

were these reviews written by dale's corporate ? short and sweet : my girlfriend sent me a bottle for christmas . she lives in alabama . i live in maine . i'm not a 'health nut' and i love good steak sauce . this is not it ! the stuff tastes like kikoman on steroids . it is so salty that i couldn't deal with it . the bottle says an avg serving has 1200 mg of salt ( sodium ) . that is more than half the daily allowance for someone with no heart problems , cholesterol , yadda yadda . this stuff is heart attack in a bottle ! it also has a bunch of msg . i am not concerned because i think the msg scare is a bunch of hoopla from the moonbat lefties crowd . if you're a moonbat type , be advised . my main complaint was the flavor . as i said it tastes just like soy sauce . not my first choice to flavor a good steak . i would strongly recommend a1 steak sauce or worcestershire sauce over this stuff any day . also , mccormick has some excellent marinades that come dry in an envelope . just add oil . sorry to dump on this stuff , but i am being as honest and objective as i can here .

poison poison " chlorhexidine " poisonwe have two beautiful saint bernards . after using these for some time , it began to be a routine that they would both have to go outside to vomit after their supposed morning treat and dental care . we investigated this chemical that the package warns you about , " chlorhexidine " and stopped using the ignorantly designed dog hating treat . no more sick dogs . if anyone likes their dog at all , they will read the package . notice first the ingredient , " chlorhexidine " then the warnings . there's good vets who don't sell these , and bad vets who like the profits . of course , pharma and all their " vet / doctor " salesmen will say this product has been tested , used for years , found to be safe in thus and thus quantities , and on and on . well , the chemical chlorhexidine is used to kill bacteria . good and bad ! it's used pre - surgically , washing the body and prescription only mouthwashes . your dog , like all living beings has a body especially a digestive tract , full of very much needed bacterium . the company knows this , and to protect themselves even warns that " serious " problems may occur , especially if your dog " licks " the surface first ? wow , and how is a dog supposed to not lick a dog chew he's sucking on for hours and yet consume it ? do some research on what this stuff will do to your dog people . unless your trying to euthanize your dog with a long , painful , and ; " conveniently - racking up a massive vet bill to diagnose " and non treatable death sentence , stop feeding them this poison . and yes , they are the same " intellectual scientists " who've managed to put half our nation on " safe for you " psychotropic drugs . ironically , " prolonged use of this poison will cause tooth discoloration , " leading to possible other side effects of tooth decay . " japan stopped using " chlorhexidine " on catheters and other medical devices in 97' after many became sick and one died . causes numerous ( still discovering more ) problems with cats . deafness , respiratory problems , in 96 in mitchell south dakota they discovered it was the cause of a plethora of severe issues with cats and had to stop using it . the believe it was from the cats " grooming " it off their coats after surgery . too many problems to report here , do your dog a favor and do your own . and don't look get your information from the doggy sites . look up the problems with the chemical . is it like declawing your animal ? " and they tell you it doesn't hurt them when they rip the dew claws out at the puppy age ? " yeah , i'd like to declaw a few vets ( pharma salesmen ) and have them give me a report ? most importantly , you do not want to kill any bacteria in your dogs system . period , that's why they've generally for so long , been so healthy , let's not screw that up as we have our own body's with infections causing irritable bowel diseases etc .

broken shells i ordered a case of these and found that there were like 3 broken shells in many of the packages . there was no damage to the shipping box however , so i assumed that they are pretty fragile . get this : i emailed amazon about the problem and they said they don't take returns on groceries , but would send me another case for free ( overnight ! ) and that i could go ahead and keep the one i had . amazing

sometimes you feel like a nut . . . i am a big fan of the planter's nut bar , except when i was a kid they were big and lasted a long time . now they've shrunk ( but i haven't ) . so when i bit into the nut and grain variety i was startled . it was almost like my favorite nutty bar , but there was something strangely healthy about it , which went against my sense of delectable unhealthy eating . if i wanted helth , i would have bought a saw dust granola bar . not . i guess if your doctor prescribes saw dust bars and you want a little peanutty flavor to them , and chew instead of the delightful crackle , get this one . it left me indifferent to health and yearning for the parent product . sometimes the old family formula is best left alone .

paper bag instead of plastic previously when i had ordered this rice it came in a fully sealed plastic bag . i loved the rice and that is why i ordered more . . . . . but . . . without any change to the advertised description , the rice came in a paper bag . the paper bag was not made water / air proof in any way , even for shipping . obviously this does not seem sanitary at all and i will not be eating it . i have received a refund . amazon has not acknowledged that the photo for this product does not represent the actual product being sent , nor the potential health risk . i will still buy from lotus foods , but will be more careful to buy in smaller quantities less likely to be switched to inappropriate packaging . i will not mark down this organic item from 5 star , but others whom are concerned about the potential for contamination from packaging not airtight should be cautious .

nice for an occassional treat this is my first time trying any of the national foods coffees . first of all , be careful when you open the package . i peeled back the cover and powdery coffee went everywhere . making the coffee is very easy - just put a few teaspoons ( they recommend four ) into a mug with hot water . i really loved the smell of this coffee . the pumpkin scent is great , and really makes you think of fall . my problem was that it was really too rich to drink more than a couple sips . the coffee seemed very sweet , and didn't match the smell , meaning that the actual coffee didn't have that " bite " of pumpkin . i didn't find it very satisfying . however , a couple family members said it " wasn't too bad " and did manage to drink the whole thing . so i think a lot depends on your taste . overall , it is a rich coffee that is best used for an occasional treat rather than as your regular morning beverage .

additives shouldn't be here my husband accidently bought me the wrong kind , " sweetleaf " is the best . this columbian brand has maltodextrin , and there is no place for it , other than used as a filler when they want to go cheap on the primary herb . don't like this one , don't know what to do with all these . good grief .

apparently stevia does not belong in sodas greatly appreciate amazon carrying this product , as it affords customers the opportunity to evaluate this product . the case arrived without the dr . zevia ( dr . pepper cans ) . ginger root beer had been substituted and doubled . unfortunately , i bought this specifically to try the cola , ginger ale , and dr . pepper equivalents . the grape and orange are the better products , although they have no coloring . unfortunately , almost all of the soda's have an aftertaste . . . reminiscent of saccharin in some peoples opinion . some found the taste to be cloying . no one found any taste to be fresh , crisp , or refreshing . i had such high hopes for stevia in soda . even canada dry diet ginger ale has more ginger taste than zevia ginger ale . zevia cola did not remind me of any similar cola i have ever had . in fact , a blind test would have revealed a mildly sweet beverage with no outstanding taste markers and of benign flavor .

tried once , switched brands . now happy . they sell these things at trader joe's , which is where i got mine originally . these are decent , if you don't already know about " mama lupe's " low carb tortillas . at only 3 carbs per tortilla , and with the closest consistency and taste of a tortilla you won't find anywhere else - other than in a regular flour tortilla - " la tortilla's " get their behinds handed to them by that brand . unfortunately ( because i love me some amazon so much ) , you'll have to buy them at netrition , where you'll have to pay a flat shipping fee of four dollars and ninety - five cents . in other words , it becomes very well worth it if you end up stocking up on them ; which you will . like this brand , you have to keep mama lupe's refrigerated or frozen . note to amazon : it breaks my heart when i have to purchase something that can only be bought online , from another website . bring mama lupe's to amazon , and show the people what a real low carb tortilla taste like . do it for us . do it for . . . america .

the cats love them , so that's a plus we've really cut back on the treats that we'll give our cats . the more we read labels , the less packaged foods we buy for us , and the choosier we get even for our pets . there's just too much junk in them all ! now , friskies often uses a lot of fillers , but cats love the taste . i think they have figured out theequivalent of kitty - msg ! however , these are one of the less junky treats for your cats . we've had them 2 or 3 times now , and they are always eaten . believe me , we have several opened bagsof uneaten treats in the drawer that our cats have refused to eat , so always glad to see them like something . the cheese flavor is their favorite crispie , but one of our cats likes the salmon one too . we still don't buy them very often , because for some reason , friskies can't seem to sever their loveaffair with corn products in their cat food and cat treats . cats don't need or want corn , so it has to be a cheapfiller for the manufacturer . the ingredients are as follows : brewers rice , chicken meal , corn gluten meal , animal fat preserved with mixed - tocopherols ( form of vitamin e ) , animal liver flavor , malt extract , natural and artificial flavors , phosphoric acid , brewers dried yeast , dried cheese powder , added color ( yellow 6 , yellow 5 and other color ) , salt , l - ascorbyl - 2 - polyphosphate ( source of vitamin c ) , citric acid , bha ( a preservative ) , bht ( a preservative ) , calcium carbonate . a - 6215 . so , are they perfect ? no , but they are crunchy , taste cheesy , and the cats do like them . one note - brewers yeast is not the same yeast you make bread with , so don't worry about that .

vitamins have a taste ok , i consume a lot of splenda every day . i eat some in my morning oatmeal , and i always make it a point to get the diet coke with splenda in it , rather than the aspartame stuff . i have been getting the fiber splenda . one gram of fiber per packet didn't seem to be much , but it was something to make the sweetener less empty , and it eliminated the gram of dextrose used to stretch the splenda to make it measure . you occasionally see the tablets of splenda , but they are rare , and they don't work on oatmeal . so i asked my wife , " please surprise me by switching to the splenda essentials with antioxidants some morning over the next week . " she agreed . on the third morning , i noted an odd taste in my cereal . not unpleasant , just odd . i asked her , and she confirmed , that was the first morning she had used the antioxidant splenda . so , unlike the fiber splenda , the antioxidant splenda has a taste . now , i normally only put sweetener in my coffee if it is nasty tasting . but i don't have any nasty tasting coffee , so i put the antioxidant splenda sweetener into regular coffee just to see if i can taste it . i am pretty sure i can taste it , but it is not a blind taste test . i am going by what i taste in my oatmeal . as i've said , the taste is minor and not unpleasant . it is hard to detect when i put one packet into 8 ounces of coffee . my opinion is that splenda is the best artificial sweetener on the market . the worst tasting is aspartame , then stevia because of the odd licorice overtone . then saccharine , and that only when a small amount of saccarine is used . i used to make ice tea with a half gallon of strong tea and one saccharine , and at that ratio , it was not bad . it took the bitter edge off of the tea . if you can get cyclamates , they go here , and then , at the top , splenda . nothing tastes like sugar , especially not corn syrup , but splenda has the most neutral sweet taste of the artificials . now that it is available , i try not to use any of the other artificials , and i am not supposed to consume a lot of sugar . so plain splenda would get five stars as an artificial sweetener . essentials with fiber would get the same score . antioxidant gets 4 stars because it has an off taste that is not a bad taste and because it is detectable other than sweetener . i believe that even with this off taste it tastes better than saccharine . so it loses one star for the detectable taste , but not more . this sweetener comes in a heavy , stiff , hard to tear bag , that could probably survive being kept in a wallet in the rain without damage , and the bag is stiff and strong enough that someone with bad arthritis might not want or be able to use the sweetener in the bag . 
=================
nice scent , gritty texture i'll start off by saying that i don't care that these are kosher . i bought them because i could get marshmallows in bulk for a gift idea . that said , i'll start with the good . these marshmallows are longer and skinnier than store - bought . they have a very pleasant vanilla scent to them as well . holding them , they are nice and squishable and if you need to rip them into bits , they're not as gooey - sticky as store bought . as for the bad , i tried these out plain and in hot cocoa . raw , they taste and feel like puffy sugar . when half melted in my drink , the sugar crystals really took over and i felt like i was eating sugary grit . kids might like this , but if you're expecting a soft , light marshmallow fluff sensation in your drink , either make your own or stick with store - bought . because of this , i probably would not buy these again and i most likely will not use these for my gifts . extra information : yes , these marshmallows state they are pork free , but to get the gelatin they needed , fish products were used instead .

the force will be with you ! the force will definitely be with you , if you install one of these chargers . this fence charger is perfect for keeping predators out , and strong enough to pack a punch , for those enclosed by it . after one or two times of testing it , my rough and rowdy bulldogs want no part of this system . we've had this charger now for several months and it works like a charm . also , like the other poster says , this unit is what the old - timers used to call weed / grass burners . it is not susceptible to shorting out , like other weaker units are , when it comes to taller grass or weeds . the heavy duty definitely applies here . if you are looking for a good , strong fence charger , look no further . i would give it 6 stars if i could !

time saver : morning coffee & mouthwash all in one anyone who has enjoyed dipping a candy cane into a mug of cocoa and savoring that hint of minty goodness that blends so perfectly with chocolate is going to be really , really disappointed by this brew . the harsh artificial peppermint flavor tastes exactly like mouthwash . the coffee flavor is very faint , there isn't much sweetness either . this is a perfectly horrible beverage . i tried adding a little sugar , hoping more sweetness would cut the medicinal peppermint assault . it didn't . forget tv commercials that depict women sighing with delight over their steaming mugs of international coffee . if those women can drink this stuff without shuddering , it can only mean one thing : they had the foresight to lace it with a double shot of bourbon . if coffee / chocolate / mint appeals to you , there's a really easy way satisfy the craving : make a cup of real coffee and toss in a peppermint patty . no kidding . it's easy and yummy . you get a lovely , rich , chocolaty , minty blend ( and you can still add that shot of bourbon if no one is looking ) . and when you finish the cup , there's this delicious chocolate - mint sludge at the bottom of the cup waiting to be spooned up .

good price , good service , the coffee's not that great the more i drink this coffee the less i like it . unless you're mixing it with lots of sugar and milk , it's harsh and acidic ( in my opinion ) . but the price is great , isn't it ? i'm currently looking for alternatives . . . . .

pecan pie larabar i have been eating larabar bars for years and love pecan pie bars . a few days ago i received a box from a warehouse in kentucky . the box had oil spots on it and when i opened a bar , there was a strange odor , almost like fermentation . i ate it because i had no lunch with me at work , but now i have 15 more bars that i will not eat . i think the temperature at the warehouse was too hot . i've never had this problem before .

surprising what can you expect from coffee in a can ? i certainly did not have very high expectations . however , when i first tasted this illy coffee , i was surprised by its strong coffee flavor . i do like my coffee strong . unlike some other reviewers , i did not find the taste bitter . generally , i do not put sugar in my coffee , or anything else for that matter . so i did notice the sugary taste . after trying the illy at room temperature , i decided that it would be fair to compare it with my usual hot coffee , so i poured the remaining liquid into a coffee cup and plopped it into the microwave . when heated , it was better than at room temperature . good coffee taste , but still too sweet . this coffee drink has 10 grams of sugar per can . that is almost as much sugar as there is in a tablespoon of granulated sugar , which comes in at 13 grams . i would never put that much sugar in a single cup of coffee . some people may like it though .

good strong coffee i love the keurig machine . green mountain coffee sells most of the k - cups , especially in stores but there is not usually good strong coffee . i love black tiger and jet fuel . on 60 minutes , the billionaire owner of gmc said they make no money on the machine itself , that they in effect give it away . what ! ? at its price i hardly call it a gift . he makes money on the k - cups so i'm happy to buy non - gmc coffee .

dog knows best . . . there are surely some tasty morsels in chef michaels grilled sirloin dog food and there are a few things which my dog wants nothing to do with . my 11 year old dog is pretty set in what she likes and does not like . she is about as discerning as a dog can be . she might have some cat in her as far as her taste buds go because she can be very picky . my dog , luelue seems to pick some bits out and chow them down pretty fast and leaves alot lying all around her bowl . then she also does that dog thing where she leave a little trail . i though this would be a good change for her but i can see that we are headed back to beneful .

eh . . well , it's okay , but why buy it ? i just don't see the reason why you should buy this when there's a box of pocky , stikko , and pretty much any other chocolate - related product sitting right next to it . you've got a couple bucks , why buy this when you could buy something much better with your money ? these have the same problem i had with pocky - - sure , the chocolate part is good , but when you get to the bread ( ? ) it's just bland as heck and out of place . i'd rather just buy a chocolate bar made by the same company , ya'know ? and don't misunderstand - - there is absolutely no bread inside the chocolate part of the candy , at least any that matters enough that you can taste it . why can't they just be split apart and sold as two different candies ? that'd how i felt when i ate it . ( but then again , the bread ( ? ) part of it isn't all that great in the first place , enough to be sold . ) they're cute . that's pretty much it . i just don't see why i'd ever eat these unless someone else bought them and offered them to me . they're not bad - - but they're just stupid . stupid in candy design . unbalanced . it's like buying lucky charms and picking out the marshmellows , really . that's what it feels like . and again , i must ask , why do you buy lucky charms if you could easily just buy a cereal completely made out of marshmellows ? also , for the cute mushroom aspect - - the mushroom tops are always tipped sideways . that's also a damper when the packaging clearly makes them all look like they're balanced . 
=================
works for dogs too i actually bought this for my dog to use . i have a mini dachshund and he uses a dog potty called ugodog . i tried the dog pottys with the artificial grass on top and they just smelled awful because the urine clings to the grass and my dog didn't want to use it ( i don't blame him ) . i put the ugodog out on the patio and he uses a sliding glass doggie door to go out . i put about 1 1 / 2 cups of pine pellets in the ugodog tray which is lined with plastic - - i buy the glad odorshield tall 13 gal . trash bags and cut them in half because cat box liners didn't fit . then the grate goes on top . i change the pellets about once a week or every 5 days and the pine completely covers the urine odor . it's easy to lift out the liner and fold up and dispose of the used pellets and solids are flushed . i tried using paper instead of the pine pellets , but they smelled and were not as absorbent . highly recommend the pellets . 
=================
baker's dream come true i really enjoy using this sugar . it never hardens and is really full flavored . i ran out and had to buy another brand and my cookies just didn't come out as well . they just tasted sweet and didn't have the depth of flavor that wholesome gave them previously . i'm never using any other sugar if i can avoid it .

very good cheese ; excellent value first off , i am not going to compare this with " fresh " or block cheese : that would be , at once , disingenuous and arrogant . this is grated parmesan in a cannister . i use it in any number of pasta , pizza , salad , soup , sauce , ( spaghetti , pizza , mornay , e . g . ) meatloaf , vegetable , and any other recipe / dish to which i want to add parmesan . does it work for me ? yes ! does it's $ 3 . 50 a pound cost beat paying anywhere from 3 - 10 times the cost ( depending on the quality ) for block parmesan ? it does for me . am i able to differentiate between the taste of different qualities of parmesan in a pizza or spaghetti sauce ? of course not : there are too many competing spices . ( i also would not use dom p & eacute ; rignon to make mimosas for the same reason . ) i should think that kraft grated parmesan would satisfy any humble palate and purse . ed01 / 11 / 2012 update : when i wrote my review , this item cost $ 21 . 00 or $ 3 . 50 a pound ; it's now $ 60 or $ 10 . 00 a pound . my local walmart sells the pound canister for $ 5 . 50 so i cannot imagine why anyone would purchase this from amazon at the current price .

better than sex ? dilettante chocolate is from seattle , where i moved away from about six months ago . i make my own mocha in the morning and when i moved , i couldn't find any product , anywhere , at any price , that truly replicated the flavor of ephemere . as an aside , this stuff tastes great on ice cream , on a spoon . . . or what have you . anyway , i find the semisweet better for coffee drinks than bittersweet ( even though i prefer very dark chocolate for eating - usually between 75 - 85 % . ) somehow , the little extra sugar brings out the chocolate flavor in the drink better . i use less of this than the bittersweet , which saves both money and calories , and what's not to like about that ? on the price front , the dilettante semisweet ephemere sauce , 22 - ounce packages ( pack of 2 ) is less expensive than the best price i ever found at a store actually in seattle . i know , now that i've said this , that the price will go up , but i'm positive it will still be cheaper . several years ago , dilettante reformulated ephemere to be all - natural , which is awesome . the only drawback , if you can call it that , is that it used to be shelf - stable . now , you have to refrigerate after opening , which makes it very , very dense . this observation leaves me wanting to share this little aside : my sister - in - law finds the visual texture of this stuff off - putting ; i will not say what she compares it to . it's so thick , however , that you have to microwave it for about 15 seconds after about a quarter of the bottle is empty , so her unappealing comparison is moot . if you like dark chocolate in things and not just for eating from a bar , you will not be disappointed in ephemere . if you like milder chocolate , go for the milk chocolate version . if you like bittersweet , your decision between semi and bittersweet , like mine , will be a little more difficult . i feel so strongly about this product that if i could give my phone number out to anyone who disagrees with my assessment to call and berate me , i would . warning : do not be surprised if you find yourself pattering off to the fridge half asleep in the middle of the night for a dollop of this on a spoon . you've been warned .

love 'em ! i read the reviews and was influenced to try these suckers based on the positive reviews . i don't necessarily buy all the organic hype about them . i do like the fact that there are no chemical dyes in them though . they all taste great to me . they don't leave an unpleasant aftertaste and they are average sized . someone said they were really small . i was expecting dum dum size , but they are flat and nearly full sized . so , if you like to have hard candy around , these aren't a bad option .

helps with heart palpitations after a little bit of research , i learned that magnesium plays a crucial role in the regulation of the heart . after being on medication for some time for unpleasant heart palpitations ( which never worked too well ) , i decided to give this supplement a try . in about 2 months , the palpitations were completely gone , and i don't have to take that horrible drug anymore ! this stuff is awesome . this was about a year ago . i have come to realize that doctors know nothing about caring for the human body and know very little about real nutrition . your just a customer to them ; they make their money by prescribing dangerous drugs that only mask symptoms but don't correct the problem at its source . magnesium is so important for the body - you cannot go wrong with this supplement . most people are deficient in this important mineral because the land is so devoid of important minerals these days , so it's very hard to get from food alone . this is the best magnesium supplement on the market . don't take those cheap magnesium pills you can get at any store . most of them don't get absorbed by the body and act only as a laxative . magnesium citrate , of which this product is , gets assimilated easily . don't be surprised if other problems your having begin to clear up as well . magnesium deficiency can cause a lot of problems . read the book " the magnesium miracle " for more info . peace .

incredibly low quality evoo this extra virgin olive oil is one of the lowest quality evoos i have ever tasted . it is very bitter if you taste it on a stand alone sip from a spoon and compare it with a true pure extra virgin olive oil ( which tend to be much more expensive . . . you get what you pay for ) . i have tasted dozens of olive oils from around the world . the reason the price is so low is because the quality is incredibly low . 
=================
almost a glass bottle would have been better , it looked like glass in the photo , i didn't pay close enough attention . i usually avoid plastic amap especially after going to the expense of buying organic ! i do not use molasses that much so i am not a good judge of the quality . i figure organic is the safest way to go . i use it mostly to make brown sugar ( regular sugar + molasses = brown sugar . . . . . i don't even mix it , just put both in my recipe . . . . careful , a little goes a long ways ! )

gulden's spicy honey mustard shames competition i have tried any number of honey mustards , and found most of them to be the consistency of mucous . they are gooey , bland and rather tasteless . not so gulden's spicy honey mustard . not just for sandwiches , we use it on everything from a meatloaf glaze to a tuna marinade . try it ! you won't be disappointed . . . again . gulden's is great ! 
=================
tasty , but the picture is misleading this cup - o - noodles knock off is fine tasting . it is not as aggressively hot as some korean foods . i would call it mild to medium - minus in the spiciness arena . it has instructions for both microwave and " add boiling water " methods of preparation . the one reason i would take off a star is that the picture on the top implies wholesome chunks of chicken and veggies . what you get are noodles that look like the noodles . broth looks similar , too . the meat and veggie particles are tiny , 6mm chunks . you really won't have to sharpen the teeth for this stuff because the meat is so small . i am sure that there is some fine print saying it's a serving suggestion and you should add your chunks of meat and vegetables , but given that , they should have just not attempted to put the tiny freeze dried pellets in there . one of those things that highlights the issue .

truth in advertising brs is neither organic , safe for diabetics , nor does it enter the bloodstream slower than other sweeteners . brs is an entirely man - made food which exists no where in nature . it is made by harvesting enzymes from bacteria , mixing them with ground rice flour , and cooking the mix to simulate the action of salivary and pancreatic amylase . this is exactly the procedure used in laboratories to study the digestion of polysaccharides . the result of this process is a concoction which consists of large amounts ( ~ 50 % ) of maltose and glucose , with a glycemic index of 105 and 100 respectively . simply ingesting a teaspoon of this stuff will make your face flush with a sugar rush . under no circumstances should brs be taken by anyone with diabetes . it will almost certainly result in hyperglycemia . yes , it tastes good , but so does maple syrup , and that is a much , much better choice for sweetening foods . the primary user for brs is cliff bars . buyer beware !

these bulk energy drink prices are outrageous i thought i'd check online to see if buying energy drinks in bulk would be cheaper than buying the 4 - 8 packs in my local grocery store . well they're not . at all . in fact the cost of this 8 pack , when you add shipping , is over twice what you'd pay if you bought 8 individually in a convenience store ( give or take some for tax )

miracle - gro for the garden i've only been gardening for a few years , and this is the first fertilizer i ever used . a few days after applying this product , all of my " struggling " garden plants seemed to get over their iffy stage and just took off . i have a very finicky ivy geranium in particular that was struggling for a year and now it's gorgeous . i went to the nursery recently for more fertilizer advice and they told me not to use miracle gro because it's full of unnatural chemicals , and gave my an organic dry fertilizer instead . i've definitely noticed that my plants had fewer blooms and growth with the new fertilizer , so i switched back and couldn't be happier . but minus one star for it's chemically - ness .

maybe o . k . for baby : not for lactose intolerant adults . i bought this , oddly enough , as a lactose - free substitute for condensed milk for baking recipes . it's o . k . , but it tastes really metallic . i'm wondering if the metallic taste means that it reacts with the can ? and if that's the case , should we be feeding it to infants ?

i've had better i bought a bunch of the kitchens of india items during a promotional sale and the only one i'd recommend is the butter chicken sauce . if they were tasty i could overlook the salt content for the occasional enjoyment but i'm not loving the taste . i ofter buy similar products from trader joes and those , in my opinion , are much better and cost far less .

great source of black sesame for chinese medicine believers ! if you're familiar with chinese medicine / herbs , you'll know that it's believed that ( black ) sesame seeds are great sources for hair and vision health . however , it is very hard to make it into my normal cooking because you can only put a little bit of it in the dishes , not enough to make any impact . i'm very glad to have found this snack . it's simple , pack with black sesame seeds and not too sweet . i'm able to eat a few pieces a day without worrying about the sugar content . i've ordered two batches now and have shared with my parents . they loved it too ! on another note , sesame seeds are supposed to taste like sesame seeds . if you don't like or are not familiar with the sesame seeds taste , you should not buy this large package . mrs . may's snacks all have pretty original taste and i'm glad that they're not trying to add other stuff / flavoring to make it taste " better " or like something else . i'm glad they've made it in a way so that people who do like it can eat more without taking in other unhealthy ingredients at the same time .

natural balance treats - out of balance i normally like the natural balance sweet potato & venison or sweet potato and bison . but this 14oz bag came busted up and the treats are a bigger size than the size in a smaller bag . the treats were really brittle and broke easily . i wouldn't buy this one any more but will buy the smaller ones in a store .

heart shaped lucky bamboo the bamboo arrived about 2 weeks after ordering , all intact and well packed . however , there were no instructions for caring of the bamboo . it is now almost a month since arriving and part of the bamboo stalk looks like it is dying and turning brown ( part of the heart shape ) . i would buy more from this company if the shipping wasn't so costly ( for the area where i live the shipping was about $ 10 and the product itself $ 15 ) .

haagen daaz it ain't , but . . . . . . . haagen daaz it ain't , but . . . . . . . it ain't bad . at least the chocolate isn't . i tried the strawberry banana and i've got to say that it was awful , i actually found it unpleasent to the point where it was ineatable . on the other hand the chocolate was not bad at all . no one is ever going to mistake it for " real " ice cream , but at 128 calories for a pint of frozen dessert treat it tastes pretty damn good . at least it satisfys the craving for something " sinful " , without blowing your diet . 128 calories versus 1000 plus calories ? ? ? ? no contest - save the haagen daaz for really special occassions .

much cheaper than prescription food , and every bit as good . i discovered this cat food last year when we moved to a new state and i was running low on my cats special prescription food . i figured i'd get it and until i could find the right vet it would do okay enough . it already had good reviews . my cat had food allergies that caused some major skin reactions and was put on this restrictive diet a couple years ago . no chicken , no grain , blah blah blah . . . all i heard was $ 50 for an 8lb bag of dry food ? ! # ! ? anyway , we'd seen how well she reacted to the prescription food and had that to compare with . our cat did start eating new bugs and probably grasses / plants when we moved to a new state so she had a flare up of her allergy , but when the weather cooled and those delicious distractions went away , the continued feeding of this natural balance food was able to get her back to normal . her digestion was never an issue with this food . and my dogs and other cat seemed to prefer this over their own dry food . so the taste was good apparantly , though i'll just take their word for it . which , by the way , was my initial venture into this food - the dry variety . but my cat was old and it was time to add the wet stuff . i am not reviewing the sellers here , as i have purchased this food in dry and both 3 / 6oz canned wet food from a couple different sellers .

sad to say it didn't work for me . . . . after my bad cholesterol hit a high of 167 my doc gave me 3 months to make some changes before we considered medications . after some research and reading the reviews here i decided to give these chews a try . i also cut out red meat , cheese , switched to non - fat milk and ate more produce . i had 2 of these per day for the last 8 weeks , 1 after lunch and 1 after dinner . i had my repeat blood work done two days ago and my bad cholesterol is now at 177 . . . . : o ( up 10 points in 3 months . glad it works for so many , but don't assume they'll work for you and don't avoid follow - up appointments with your doctor thinking you have nothing to worry about . you might just be one of the unlucky ones like me . . .

this stuff is dangerous . so i got this stuff wednesday afternoon just in time for lunch . i used about a teardrop amount on my food and have to admit i was on the verge of sweating . taste could be better but this stuff is hot ! be careful not to leave this stuff lying around the house though . my pops came home from work that same night and mistakened this for regular hot sauce . he doused his food with this stuff and got one bite before realizing something was wrong . he was in a lot of stomach pain ( enough to bring him to the floor ) and sweating as if he'd ran a marathon . now there's a danger label on it that i personally made .

tastes fine but the shipping kills the deal the shipping cost on this product doubles the price which makes it more expensive than elsewhere .

not buying again my husband wanted to buy this for me on a whim , because i am sensitive to gluten . i should have said no , not until i check all reviews . i actually love garbanzo beans so i thought why not try it ? i used only 1 / 6 of this flour in a puffed pear pancake recipe from real simple . i used apples instead of pears and extra sugar / cinnamon . i also added some sugar to the batter to try and help cover up any bad flavor . i am not sure why i thought there would be some , but i did . maybe it had started to smell funny already ? well , i baked 2 apple pancakes . 1 normal and 1 gluten free . i baked them at the same time in the same oven . that's when i started smelling the yucky smell . i was afraid the good one would be contaminated . thankfully it wasn't . i have yet to offer the gf one to the rest of the family since they have their own . no one else commented on the yucky smell , so maybe i am just hyper sensitive to it . maybe you do have to make something savory not sweet to enjoy it . all i can say is i am glad only 1 / 6 of the flour i used was this stuff . the rest was rice , tapioca , and potato . i am new to making my own baking flour mixes . but i have used specialty gf bread flours to make bread and it was delicious ! it didn't rise quite right but the flavor was like french bread . i even eat dry crumbly rice bread and that's okay with me . i have even made white bean muffins when on the south beach diet and those didn't have a weird , toxic taste / aftertaste / smell . so i plan on trying some other way to use this stuff , but if that doesn't work it is in the trash or i will offer it to a local person who may want to try some free gf flour . maybe they won't notice the taste / smell . 
=================
soup is tasty butttttt i purchased this as the winter months are upon us . however who invented the container that the soup is packaged in needs to go back to the drawing table . as the product is heating in the microwave , they tip over spilling the contents . so not only have you lost your meal but a big mess to clean up too . i have a case to use up so will just empty into a mug to heat . 
=================
nice as breading for frying . . . these crackers have nice flavor . they can be used to coat chicken for frying . . . so many of them were broken anyway , i just crunched them a little bit more . . . and problem solved . not enough of them fit to present at the table . this is second time ordered with this outcome . 
=================
shipping costs it is true that the shipping costs really make this some mighty expensive product ! i have a disability and sometimes like delivery on heavier items - believe it or not when i have to order from a local , nationwide office supply chain i can throw in a case of cokes and the shipping is the same as the other items - much better way if you want or need to have it delivered . otherwise - i buy smaller quantities and make a few trips to the car ! : ) 
=================
i didn't see the sticker there was a sticker placed on the package of tea that said it was roobios tea . it wasn't printed on the box , just the sticker . at first that made me think that it was just plain tea . i will take ther word as to the sticker that it is what i ordered . sorry for the mishap . the tea is very good . 
=================
chia seeds good price to high i purchased the chia seeds , i did not realize it said 1 oz . if i would have realized it was 1 oz instead of 1 lb . i would not have purchase the product . 11 . 95 for 1 oz of chia seeds is over priced . shiping for 1 oz . is even less then the price i paid . when i order chia seeds i look forward to making bread and smoothies i know next time to read a little closer . 
=================
vomitous one's first thoughts on eating this cereal are of the bathroom , and for two reasons . first , that's where its taste seems to come from , and second , because that's where any mouthful should immediately be coughed up . the best that can be said about krave is that it will , one hopes , soon be off the market . its commercial success , if it wins any , will mean only that america's taste buds have finally succumbed to their long - sustained beating at the hands of disgusting products that companies try to pass off as 'food . '

read the fine print ! be careful when ordering this item , i expected for every type of tea pictured to come in the pack , however what comes is based on availability and there were two kinds replaced with more of others . i still received the correct number of teas , i just should have read the description more carefully . 
=================
great sauce , but customer servive at mariesharps . us sucks ordered case , no response to emails , 6 wks now . . . . contacted paypal , hopefully they ll help me . . . . . . i want my sauce ! !

defectve product - promptly replaced ! i just bought six dozen millstone breakfast blend light roast k cups and am having a problem . water does not come out of the cups i have tried . the machine works fine with other cups however with the new cups out of the batch i just bought water does not come out of them . best if used by feb 11 , 2013 2138725 pl054 14 : 48 is on the back of the box . since amazon will not accept food products for refund or replacement . i guess i am out $ 43 . 92 with no recourse . update i contacted keurig , they sent me credit for the defective k cups . it seems keurig buys coffee from coffee companies and they put it into k cups . any problem with getting the coffee out of the k cups is keurigs job to solve . 
=================
not bad - just too costly first of all - the seaweed salad , following directions , isn't at all bad . however , the serving size is very small . when i made up 2 packs , one for myself and one for my wife , we looked at the quantity of salad in each of our cups , and realized that it was definitely not worth $ 2 for each serving . one suggestion i have is that you add the dressing a little at a time . the first time we made up each cup , we used the entire packet - it was too strong . for our taste , one packet divided between 2 cups was just right . except for the price , i would have ordered more . when we bought this item , it was $ 12 for 6 individual servings .

my monkeys refuse to eat unless . . . yes , you read that correctly . both cats refuse to eat unless they have a large heaping of cat - man - doo . they will go on hunger strikes if this is not incorporated into their meals twice a day . once i ran out and they both loss weight because they would not look at their dry food or even wet food . they also , consume less food if they have this placed as a side dish . thank you ! ! ! my babies are happy ! 
=================
received wrong item i ordered the light roast , but received a collection of different flavors . my husband does not like flavors . the description did not say different flavors and the picture here does not match the picture on what we received . ours says includes coffee house regular , chocolate glazed , cinamon and decaf . the item ordered does not say that . i think it was a fluke and we got the wrong item . can you please send us the correct item ? i've never had this problem with amazon before . thanks . mary
=================
it was broken ! when the tree was delivered it looked great , but i noticed after about 2 - 3 weeks it started dying . later i looked closely and the tree had been broken at the trunk . . . . too late to send it back to amazon ! i have ordered 3 other ficus trees and they are great . maybe it broke during shipment , but i will not order another jade bonsai . i see others rating it highly and i probably just got a bad one or it was damaged during packing or shipping , so take this review with a grain of salt . . . . please look very closely at the tree upon arrival . . . . inspect the trunk for any breaks . 
=================
really great for baking for me , the only use for this is baking or making chocolate sauces out of it . it's just too bitter to eat plain and it doesn't really taste much until your mouth melts it . that is , if you chew it up , it's pretty much tasteless until it melts in your mouth . at that point , however , it's just too bitter for me . i made a chocolate sauce with cream and a little sugar and it was wonderful over ice cream , and even just plain ( the little bit of sugar cuts the bitterness a lot ) . by the way , be prepared to chop the pieces . as is , they are a little large for anything , unless you're just going to melt them in a double boiler . 
=================
my cats were un responsive i've had cats my whole life and catnip is a mysterious thing that i sure don't understand . they say not all cats are affected ( which could be a made up lie someone in the catnip industry created ) so you never know if its the cat or the catnip brand or maybe the cat just needs to be in the mood . all i can tell you is this : my neighbor bought some catnip and gave me some for my cats . my cats went crazy ! the female rolled in it over and over . so i ordered some of my own . only i couldn't remember what my neighbor brought so i ordered this one , the sojos . the sojos did nothing at all for my cat . sure , it was fragrant , but the cat wasn't interested . i have ordered the exact same brand my neighbor brought over ( frontier ) and when it comes i will update this after the kitties try it . i will find out if kitties are particular to brand or if they need to be in a catnip mood .

i agree it was fast shipment but . . . it was the first ever i've ordered a box of marzipan and the paper stuck to the assorted fruit pieces . it quite spoiled the treat for me . i will try a different source which was served to me at xmas . it was less expensive and just as delicious . shame on you bergen . 
=================
why 25 . 99 ? ? ? ? ? ? why are they a dollar more than if i bought the whole box at the liquor store ? ? ? ? we should be getting a better deal buying them in bulk online . . . in my opinion . . . come on ! 20 bucks i'll take it .

danger ! danger ! you'll not be able to stop eating these ! these mangoes are pure quality . no disgusting after - taste like so many other brands . there are no sulfites or added sweetners just the pure fruit . highly recommend them but beware because you will not be able to put them down . 
=================
shipping flawed i ordered two cases , 8 each , of the oregon red tart cherries . when i received the package , the two cases were in a large box with no packing at all . when i examined the cans , only four did not have any dents and four were badly dented . it did not appear that any of the cans seal had been broken , but it will be impossible to open the cans on the top . the cherries in the can i have used were very good . 
=================
chicken noodle soup this is not what i was wanting . i am looking for old original chicken noodle soup . it had thin vermicelli noodles and chives chopped up in it . this needs a lot added to it to make taste like it should . 
=================
brussel sprouts for your cat apparently this cat food represents the culmination of exhaustive research into feline nutrition . that may be the case , but good luck getting your cat to eat it . feeding this stuff to a finnicky cat is like trying to get a third grader to eat his broccoli . i have to coat it with friskies wet - food to even spark my bengal's interest , and she still eats around the core nuggets whenever possible . we haven't had this problem with other dried foods ( royal canin , et al . ) so i can only assume it's the specific taste or texture . back to the drawing board . 
=================
big surprise . a funny thing happened on amazon , i ordered a bluetooth adapter for my ipod classic and after much anticipation , i get dumpling mix from germany . wow , i would think that someone would validate such an absurd order . after getting burned like this , i intend not to use this service any longer and i feel they lack the quality control required to validate orders correctly . dumpling mix in lieu of an adapter . . . thanks a lot ! ! ! here is my review ! 
=================
vino 1 the quality of the vino italiano was comparable to the low price of the wine kit . when it was completed it tasted very watery . i have purchased fior d'uva ( dried grapes ) and i am adding that to the next batch of wine . i am told that that will add more body to the wine . it will be completed in about 2 weeks and i will know then .

review had an issue with the chicken breast treats , so would not use these , since they are produced in china as well .

good price , ok quality this jerky tastes okay , but it seems like this isn't made from the best quality meat . i don't know if i got a bad batch , but all the jerky i ate had hard veins running through them . all in all , i would give 2 . 5 stars , but since i can't , and i don't like rounding up , i have to go with 2 . pros : the jerky is tender , but not overly tender . it is a good consistancy ( except for the occassional tough fiber running through them ) . cons : the quality of the meat was sub par , which says a lot , since you don't need the best cuts to make jerky ( its basically dried ground meat ) . as the other reviewers pointed out , the package says the beef could be from usa or from a variety of other countries . i'm pretty certain mine didn't come from the us . neutral : the flavor was okay . it wasn't bad , but it wasn't anything special either . there are many other jerkys out there that have outstanding flavor .

perfect ! ! ! ! i got for a christas gift the starbuckd three pack with the choch covefed espreson beans , choch coverev chrerries and the chock covdred alomod bars . while the later was , least favofite , the former two blew my mind with all their chocholatey goodess . needless to say when the season was over so were the chocholates ; so i became a woman on a mssion . i found then ! ( not the brand , of course ) , ghiradelli is next to perfect ! i love them so much not only did i order one order of three choch covered espresso beans , but two of the choch covered cherries . ok , so i love then so much i placed two more orders , only this time with more of the cherries . now , that said , i've never been a fan of the choch covered cherries , but these are not like the the traditional cordials with that gooey liquidy center that makes them too sweet for my taste . needless to say i'll have enough to last me a while . . . at least a week or so , lol . enoy ! oh , did i mention the packges are small . . . but dont all good things come in small packages ? rachel

arrowroot i agree with the last post . i just received my arrowroot and thought i was buying a bit more than what i received . it's in a tiny box , and yes , i paid 7 dollars in shipping . not happy .

its fun to make but taste's odd i bought this over the summer and made it with my friend . the instructions are in japanese , but there are pictures to help you , but me and my friend used a video on youtube to make sure we knew what we were doing . it was really fun to make , but when we took a bite out of everything , we spit them out . the noodles tasted sweet , but in a really artificial weird type of way . the black seeds were the best part in my opinion though . the rice was okay , but more fun to squish than eat . i wouldn't mind purchasing this item again , though . 
=================
easy to take with you , cost is a little high , i don't like this flavor at all . this is a concentrated water enhancer that doesn't need to be refrigerated and can be taken anywhere . what i like about mio is that i can take it with me on the road and turn any water into flavored water . i have never liked to drink plain tap water but mio can change that . each bottle is said to last 24 servings but it will change depending on your personal taste . one serving is a brief squirt or  teaspoon of mio . it's doesn't have any calories or carbs which is important to me because i am trying watch my weight . i have tried other flavors that were better but i don't like the sweet tea flavor at all . it tastes exactly like what it is fake tea . it hardly resembles the taste of tea at all with all in my opinion . i could hardly finish a couple glasses of it and would not get it again . i let my wife try it and she liked it so it will obviously depend on your individual taste . the cost seems high for such a small bottle but it will flavor 192 oz . of water . 
=================
love this product , but . . . . . . it would not dissolve fully . product from local grocery dissolved fine , but what i bought from amazon left chunks of product in the iced tea . very strange . but do buy this product somewhere ! no glycemic index , no carbs , no calories . splenda and even other stevia products can't match those stats ! cheers ! 
=================
instead purchase rescue . . . i tried this flytrap because my store was out of the rescue brand ( sterling nft - d disposable fly control trapwith attractant ) . this victor has not caught one fly in four days , while my existing rescue trap has and is catching 50 + flies per day . yes the rescue does smell bad - you have to put it 10 + feet from your porch , but it works ! i place one in the trees approx . 20' away on 'each' side of the house . i recommend buying the rescue flytrap - amazon search " rescue fly trap " .

a bit 2 chocolatie for me i was a bit disappointed at the product b / c it's got too much chocolate on it . they tasted more like candy bars more so than just chocolate covered cashews .

other customer reviews were right on ! prior to purchasing these flowers for mother's day , i read the other customer reviews and i have to tell you they were right on . they gave glowing reviews of the speed of delivery and the quality of the flowers when they arrived . my mom commented several times on how great they looked long after their arrival . you can be sure you are ordering a quality product when you order these flowers .

results vary for hot air poppers some good results some bad . . . , october 16 , 2009by v . sandy " v " ( prescott , az ) - see all my reviewsamazon verified purchase ( what's this ? ) i bought the 12 bottle variety to try out . i just recently started using a hot air popper so wanted to see what varieties worked well . first off . the baby white and baby yellow kernels are just too light for use in a hot air popper . we did pop them at work using a traditional popper and they were fine . the are two varieties that stood out as my favorites for my hot air popper . the first is the wisconsin white birch , which popped up big , fluffy and close to zero unpopped or blow out kernels . the second is savannah gold , it popped up big , nice volume and again almost zero unpopped or blow out kernels . two varieties that are close seconds as favorites are : autumn blaze blend ( small , crisp , no unpopped kernels but quite a few blow outs ) and high mountain midnight ( some no pops , good volume ) . there was only one variety that i would not ever use again . the black hills had about 4 times the quantity of unpopped kernels as any of the other types , the kernels popped up very small , it was extremely hully and some kernels burnt in the hot air popper . orchard blossom , red river valley and harvest blend types all popped fine in my hot air popper with only a few unpopped kernels . the blue heron also popped fine with a few more unpopped kernels than the three mentioned in the sentence before ; it was also earthy in taste and popped up small kernels . savannah fire had very few close to no pops and was very chewy without being hully .

try it vegetarian - the right amount of savory / spicy / sweet this was a breeze to make . i added a very large boneless chicken breast in bite - sized pieces ( much less in quantity than the recommended amount of beef ) and added diced onions , sliced carrots , peas , and diced sweet potato . i was tempted to make it a totally vegetarian meal , because my husband will not eat beef , and he really does not like meat much at all . but for flavor , and to cut fat , i cooked the chicken and veggies in a bit of coconut oil . delicious . it's true that the coconut powder gets lumpy , but i followed some advice to whisk it up prior to adding it . tasted similar to the veggie curry i make with curry paste and coconut milk , but not quite as creamy . the added crunchiness of some of the ingredients ( peanuts , coconut ) added to that made it even more appealing . i just love coconut curry . there is something about the savory / spicy / sweetness that is appealing to me . i added more chili from a spice bottle . i don't have experience with the " real thing " , as i don't travel to other countries , or try many ethnic restaurants . i just knew this was a coconut curry , and that is how i prepare it . the chicken was so flavorful , as were the vegetables . ( the sweet potato - - wow ! ) the sauce permeates everything . very fragrant . i have been going back and forth in my mind about the price . i decided that since i am the only curry lover in this house , it just doesn't pay to get the curry paste jars and store them . coconut milk , which is creamier , i do buy the premium brand . so , it is costly to buy the ingredients to make it by scratch if you aren't going to use the rest of the curry paste before it goes bad . if you add the peanuts and such to the cost per package , you are talking bucks ! so , for a novelty , i believe the price is justified . this package makes quite a bit , so after two people eating , there are leftovers , and i froze them immediately after cooling . heated back up , the consistency isn't as good , but passable . i would buy this , but just not in a case . i have no room . the only cases i buy from amazon ( and i shop here a lot ) are of bottles of a name brand jalapeno sauce . i go through that fast ! but if you want a good curry , and you eat it a lot , i recommend buying it from amazon .

a little lumpy i like putting peanut butter in my protein shakes and was hoping pb2 would be the answer . it doesn't taste quite as good as creamy peanut butter and there is tiny hard lumps in my protein shake . i haven't tried using it in a blender to get the lumps out . i just use a shaker cup .

love the coffee , no defective cups there's plenty of reviews on here talking about what the coffee is like . since this is subjective and you really have to try it to see if you like it , i'll talk about the quality . there are some reviews that say they received some damages cups , torn foil , etc . i can tell you that out of 50 cups , i received zero defective or damaged cups . no problems , all 50 of them worked just fine .

this is how i plant them length : : 2 : 25 minsthey are oats , wheat , rye , and barley . in other words , they do seed if allowed to mature before getting killed by cats . since i do have a backyard with space to plant , i plant seeds in soil . it takes about 4 months to complete their life cycle . during their growth , i only pick off tips of the leaves so they could still continue to grow . only the last few days of seed maturing the leaves turn dry and yellow and are not edible . in return , i could get seeds " for free " to plant right away , as long as the weather allows it . i don't use any pest control or use any fertilizer , so certainly not all of the seeds would survive . aphids , with the help of ants , and snails do invade , and a slight strong gust could break their fragile stems . however , i could be sure that they are certainly organic through out the process . and the source of grass would not die down during the months they grow . in the end , the wood container becomes cat treat bag holder . anyhow , my russian blue is very rough at biting grass , so planting inside the box had been countless flip - overs and soil - spills . notes : if planting outside , remember to wash before feeding to cats , and certainly don't pick off parts that had been bitten by aphids or crawled by snails .

after taste and more caffeine than cup of coffee have we become so lazy we need an expensive 2 oz container to give us the healthy energy we can get for much less money , via eating healthy fruits , vegetables and buying a bottle of b complex vitamins ? as dr oz and other medical professionals note , if the label has something on it you cannot pronounce don't buy it . bear in mind the 2 oz container has 160 mg of caffeine , compared to 1 cup of brewed coffee which has 80 - 135 mg . or an espresso cup which has 100 mg . and coffee is meant to be drunk and enjoyed slower . i just don't think the 160 in on shot is healthy . as for taste , the berry flavour was akin to some cherry kool aid loaded with sugar , with an after taste . yuck ! and the stuff can make you hyper if you are not a caffeine drinker of any kind be it coffee or soda drinks .

pump not included its great how they show a picture of this product with the pump attached leading buyers to believe the pump is included . its even better how in little font it says pump not included . i just realized this after receiving the product without a pump . the little bullet that says pump not included is very easy to miss . why would you put a picture of the pump with this product if it is not included ? it should be made clear to everybody that purchases this product that the pump is indeed not included and this is false advertisement . everybody beware that pump is sold separately !

the best green tea i've found ! i've tried several green teas , both in bags and loose . numi organic temple of heaven gunpowder is by far the best . i like everything about it . the taste , the quality packaging to ensure freshness , the price , and the " gunpowder " pellets - it is easy to measure and know just how much you are actually using . two pounds lasts me about a month . i drink green tea mainly for the health benefits , which are too numerous to mention here . i drank white tea for quite a while but don't like full leaves because you have big pieces at the top of the bag and powder at the bottom , very inconsistent - if they made a quality white tea like this in gunpowder form i would likely alternate between that and this tea . i tried another gunpowder green tea ( in the same price range ) and compared it to numi . it was less densely packed and much darker ( indicating older tea or over - processing ? ) with significant extraneous matter in each one pound bag . i will drink this tea forever unless something better ( for the price ) comes my way but , after experimenting with different teas for about three years , i haven't felt inclined to find something different for at least a year now . . . i use the " subscribe and save " option so i get two 1 lb bags shipped every month for a 15 % discount and free shipping . there are other shipping options as well - up to once every six months . numi organic tea gunpowder green - full leaf , loose leaf , temple of heaven green tea , 16 oz bag ( pack of 2 )

leaky and messy it's just a plastic cap that costs them $ 0 . 02 to make and they sell it for a big markup . i've used it 4 - 5 times with different original k - cups . it a bit of a pain to clean out the k - cups and then if these kaps are used and not brewed right away , there is a hole at in the kap that allows air into the coffee to ruin the taste if stored over time and also allows the coffee to spill out if you tip it over . you can place a sticker over the hole or a piece of tape , but then that's another annoying step that detracts from the convenience of the k - cup . i'm going back to the commercially available k - cups and when i want to grind my own cup of coffee , it's quicker and less mess to use my french press with instant hot water from the 3l electric thermal hot pot my wife keeps for her tea . well , at least i can use these kaps as poker chips .

good , if unnecessary some people may find the whole idea of the " chef michael " line a little over the top : gourmet food for dogs , created by a top chef . to be honest , it isn't likely that we ever would have tried this product if i hadn't been sent a sample package for review . our dog is an 80 pound mixed sharpei and great dane , and chef michael seems to be targeted more to smaller dogs ; we would have to give our dog about eight cups a day , and that would get to be a much more costly proposition than his regular dry dog food , a generic brand ( which we've lately started mixing with purina beneful , which i've reviewed separately ) . chef michael claims to have sirloin steak flavor with potato and green bean accompaniments . in fact , it is 26 % beef , and the other items are there , but the mix contains quite a bit of filler . i just don't see the need to feed the dog much in the way of filler , or for that matter to pay for it . certainly , the dog loves it and it serves ( for us ) as a great treat item rather than a mainstay of his diet . if you have a smaller dog , and don't mind the higher cost , this could be a regular meal item . but a lot of the makeup of the product seems pitched to a human taste . the beef pieces , which are processed meat , are made up to look like little pieces of steak , complete with grill marks . that's nice , but do you think your dog will notice ? will your dog recognize the potato and green bean accompaniments as he's enjoying his meal ? our dog , frankly , just eats it . he loves it but i doubt that it's because there are faux grill marks on the beef pieces . a comment on the packaging : it would have been nice if the package was resealable . and whoever came up with the photo on the front of the package really needs to go into another line of work . it makes the product look incredibly unappealing . my bottom line is that this is a nice but ultimately unnecessary product . if you want to move up from generic dry dog food , try something like purina beneful instead . it's less expensive , less pretentious , and the dog eats it just as eagerly .

if you're too lazy to make your own . . . look , demitri's a seattle homie and i support anything our locals do in business but i think the hyperbole about this stuff is a little silly . is it a bad bloody mix ? absolutely not . it's flavorful and consistent . but i have never gotten why so many people seem to be so hell - bent on tarting up what is a very simple recipe . demitri's , like every other commercially - made recipe , tucks in a whole laundry list of extraneous flavors - baking spices , onions , jalapenos , etc . , etc . , etc . - that actually detract , imho , from the pungent , meaty quality of a great bloody . i've had this one and nearly every other mix out there and never had one that was anywhere near as good as we find here in seattle at temple billiards . finally , it hit me one day that i've been a chef my whole adult life and there was nothing stopping me from making my own . there's nothing stopping you either . it's fun and interesting and you can get exactly what you like . i'm not saying don't buy demitri's . if you're not creative ( or just really lazy ) , it's fine alternative . but a ) i don't like brown bloody mary's ( that should be called a dried - bloody mary ) and b ) it's just better because it's fresher . duh . if you enjoy demitri's , good on ya . but don't lose sight of the fact that you can make better ( or just as good ) right at home , for a lot less $ $ $ .

arrived 8 days after the best before date i haven't even opened these yet , but i wanted to warn you - the 3 packages i received were already 8 days past the " best before " date printed on the package . i'm not super worried about using them , and probably will ( instead of returning them ) , but i would recommend buying from a source where you can check the date first .

instant resolution of food allergy one of our 2 cats developed an apparent food allergy ( lots of vomiting ) to the friskies dry food we had been feeding them . doing research i found that the corn and soy included in such cheap cat food kibbles is often a culprit . switched to diamond and the gi distress immediately vanished and hasn't returned . our mildly fussy cats immediately took to the new food which i supplement with a little liver and nutritional yeast . both cats seem to be thriving on it with glistening coats and no illnesses whatever .

i found a long leg spider in the jar when i opened this jar to make my morning espresso , i found a skinny long leg spider ( dead ) in it . it spoiled my appetite for everthing . . . i guess i will have to return it .

barren creek beef jerky package came with the sweet bbq jerky and also a free sample of barren creek's top shelf jerky . that's a customer service + for me . unforunately , the sweet bbq is not great beef jerky . texture was poor , you get solid slabs of meat but they're quite dry . the flavor is odd too , definitely does not make me think of sweet and bbq . the top shelf jerky is quite good though , although a bit too salty . overall the product is not great , but it's a company i'd keep my eye on .

didn't really work i usually hit a wall right around 2 : 00 in the afternoon at work . i start yawning and my eyes get heavy . i tried 5hr energy to get passed that feeling but it didn't really help . i noticed a slight difference in my energy level but unfortunately it wasn't enough to make me feel awake and refreshed . i received a free sample of 5 - hour energy from smiley360 .

delcious yes , healthy , nooooo . . . . no trans fat yea ! no msg yea ! 6g protein yea ! 46g of carbs hmmmmmm . . . . well it is noodles . . . 1290mg of nacl . . . . . ouch ! ! i just had half a bowl , my daughter couldn't finish it . i forgot to check the salt content before i bought a 6 pack @ costco . one bowl is 2 servings . each serving contains 1290 mg ( 1 . 29g ) of salt . enough to make your own small ocean ( ok i exxagerate ) . the recommended max salt intake per human per diem is about 2 . 3g . surely the flavor could be saved with 1 / 3 the salt ? i wonder if i can return it . . . ? 
=================
too expensive ! i ordered six bottles of this from amazon and was shocked that they were so small ! eight ounces for almost $ 6 each ! a recipe might call for more than one bottle . fortunately karo no longer puts hfcs in their kight corn syrup and it's available in all the grocery store . so , that's what i'll be buying from now on ! 
=================
it's a crap shoot ! each roll is different , some are so tough it takes my lab a week to eat it and others are thin and brittle with tiny dry slivers of rawhide in the center and leave a huge mess behind , those he eats in a hour and about 50 % of the rolls are just fine . i found this to be the case on different bags i have purchased over a year apart . 
=================
smelly my cat loves this , and from what i've read , it's pretty high quality . at the same time , it has a very strong smell to it . we walked into the kitchen after buying it , saying , " what is that smell ? " it smells distinctly fishy , like someone left out tuna or something . if it was a faint smell , i wouldn't care , but this is a bit much . our house already smells too much from her litter box . we don't plan on buying this again . 
=================
defective k - cups ? i usually do not want to complain about a product but i just started using the brooklyn bean cyclone dark roast k - cups and have a issue with the k - cup itself . seems it likes to make a real mess of my coffee maker with grounds all over the place . i have not had a problem with any other k - cup brand coffee , just this one , perhaps some problem with how they were made . the few time i could get one to work in all fairness the coffee was good , thats why i have purchased this before . i have sent a email to the company and will see how they respond , for now i would suggest holding off purchasing until the problem is resolvedupdate : they responded to my email , i guess there was a batch problem afterall . amazon shoud not ship the defective batches and return them to brooklyn . on the positive side they will be sending me replacement coffee . i will update again when new coffee arrives . i would say at least they have good customer service . update 7 - 11 - 2012i received my replacement shipment for the defective k cups that i mentioned above along with a nice bonus of sample k cups . its hard to find a company anymore that stands behind their product but i can say 'brooklyn bean roastery " does bu responding quickly to my problem . customer service is still alive and well , i'm sure the coffee will exceed my expectations , the customer service sure has . 
=================
allsorts just what i wanted and it arrived quickly . unfortunatly , it got hot along the way and was stuck in a lump . oh well , thanks anyway .

mediocre taste the dishes are very convenient , not doubt . however , i thought the taste was pretty middling at best . ( except the spinach with paneer . . . it was great ! ) also , some of the dishes gave me heartburn . conclusion of my review : by the 6 pack of the spinach paneer dish . i do . 
=================
very crunchy , very good i have purchased these cookies twice now ( i'm backlogged , but i was afraid that amazon wouldn't stock them again ) and i'm slowly eating my way through them . many people have attempted to describe the taste and i agree with most of the previous descriptions - they are not hyper sweet or milk chocolate - y , but rather almost like a darker chocolate taste . don't take me calling it dark chocolate to mean they're bitter , because they're not , but imagine the taste of a normal hershey's bar if you removed half the sugar . you'd still get the nice taste of chocolate , but just in a more subdued fashion . if you have a chocolate craving , and not a sugar craving , you'll love these cookies . if you have just a simple sweet tooth and a craving for sugar , well these may not be quite what you're looking for . one thing to keep in mind is that these are what i would classify as " very hard " cookies . most of the cookies you find on the grocery stores now days contain quite a few fatty ingredients that make the cookie yield in your mouth instead of crunching . these suckers crunch . a lot . i would even go far as to say that if you have dental issues , milk would be a requirement to eat these . the texture is very similar to eating nature's valley granola bars ( not the chewy ones ) . 
=================
new packaging + new recipe = great ! the old recipe was really sticky and the chocolate melted . it also tasted only ok . with this new packaging , it seems like they have also updated the recipe . it is now more solid , easier to eat , and less 'grassy' . i was going to cancel my subscription , but not anymore ! 
=================
those little elves are . . . living like trillionaires , for what the high cost of keeblers is . i found that the taste was a bit better than the store brand and there is no question to that , but the cost is just not worth the small difference . i wouldnt suggest a hit and run over one elve , may decrease the cost as there productivity should go up with fewer working elves . you know like the rest of us in this country , that need to work ten times as hard , to just make ends meet . 
=================
no sleep for you ! the flavor was pretty good , but it wasn't terribly strong . i almost wanted there to be bubbles . as for the energy , i couldn't sleep hours later after drinking this . i was wide awake until the wee hour of the morning . no drinking this stuff after 10am . 
=================
tasteless . . . . . i use to like this olive oil - i've been buying it from costco for the last 10 years - and used to think it's great oil ( i still buy it sometime , just because i cannot always find my other favorite ones ) , until i tried another middle eastern variety ( from greece , especially lebanon ) . wow , what a difference . this berio oil is like just a colored water , tasteless , odorless . it's basically a colored water as any italian olive oil , even the bertolli brand which is more expensive . italian olive oil are expensive , but in my opinion they are much less in quality than their other middle eastern counterpart . if you like the real aroma and the strong taste of olive oil , you should try either a greek or lebanese . i doubt anybody will be able to try the lebanese ( the best ) variety because it's so expensive and rare , and people over there keep it for themselves . but the greek oil is much more available , affordable in price , and much better than any italian one . just google olive oil and you will seeeveryone taste is different . . . . . . . . 
=================
you have to know the product to get it right ! i'm writing this review to provide other interested customers with a more realistic expectation than the other review listed with this product does . . . the first time i've tried the tea forte green mango peach tea was via one of their silken infusers . i loved the flavor of it , i didn't even notice at that point that there was any mint included with it . when i received the loose leaf tea i ran into the same issue the other buyer did : the tea had a strong mint flavor overpowering almost all other flavors in this tea . i went ahead and used much less tea leafs ( i have one of their 12oz kati tumblers and used just 1 tsp of tea leafs with that ) and only left the leafs in the hot water for a minute or two . with that i was able to get the desired flavor . i can see how someone , that hasn't used the silken infuser and therefore has no idea what this tea is supposed to taste like , would be disappointed with this product . if you use the method of brewing i've described you barely taste any mint flavor and the mango and peach flavors come out as intended / desired . 
=================
hard to eat they are very pretty - look like real pearls . but they are very hard and i'm afraid to use them on my cupcakes . don't want anyone to break a tooth on these ! seller was prompt , and the photo is exact .

bring back the old recipe ! this is one of my favorite campbell's soups . i bought a can recently at the market and found that they've changed the recipe to include carrots and other vegetables and got rid of the spinach . the flavor is different . i don't like the change at all . the old recipe was tasty and the spinach a nice touch . campbell's , please bring back the old recipe !

sweetleaf liquid stevia changed something about 6 mos ago ? my wife and i have been purchasing and using sweetleaf liquid stevia for approx 3 years ( auto - purchase the 2 - pack , 4 oz bottles , monthly ) . until recently , it was marketed in brown bottles and the liquid was crystal clear . about 6 mos ago the packaging changed to green bottles and from the very first shipment , there was a white suspension and white mucus around inside of cap and rim of the bottle . that said , we still use it ; have not noticed any change in concentration ( still use 5 to 6 drops equivalency to 1 teaspoon of sugar ) . it has not been watered down and we have not seen black suspension or mold as other reviewers have indicated . and , we've not noticed any symptoms one might expect if the congealed substance was anything toxic . our guess is that some of the stevia extract is congealing due to a manufacturing process change . hopefully , wisdom natural brands , the manufacturer , will rectify this and return it to it's crystal clear liquid . until then , we're still using the liquid , ignoring the suspension and enjoying the 'sweet' life . if you really can't handle the current product , check out now brands stevia . it's priced about the same and , while we haven't tried it recently , it's probably still crystal clear . hope this helps . 
=================
more fiber it took a couple of days for my dogs to convince themselves that this was ok to eat , but then that happens anytime you change food . i purchased the product due to its high fiber content to try and relieve the dragging of the butt on carpet syndrome . it is too early to tell if successful but it is apparent that their bms appear to be easier , quicker , and a lighter color and i'm still mixing the nutrisca w / their old food 50 / 50 . i believe this will be a great product for my dogs' digestive health . so , to amend my previous review , yes it does have more fiber but my dogs refuse to eat it so i guess i have to rate it lower than my original review .

taste is subjective , especially with different teas i recently started to drink 2 or more cups of both the red and the green varieties of davidson's rooibos teas . personally , i like the tastes of both varieties and enjoy drinking the tea , regardless of any consideration of potential health benefits . for me , the tea requires no additives , which are found in other brands and / or used by other consumers . but taste is such a personal , subjective thing and it is understandable why the amazon reviews for this product contain such diverse opinions in this regard . my suggestion is to try the pure form before you make a decision based solely on these reviews to see if you like it or not .

beautiful packaging , waxy chocolate i received these chocolates as a gift and was very impressed by the packaging . the tasting experience was quite a bit different - - the chocolate tasted waxy and lacked the rich flavor and creamy texture that i was looking forward to . . .

different taste this was my favorite flavor of the torani sf syrups , but i agree with other reviewers , the taste has changed . and i also agree - not in a good way . 
=================
not minced , this is ground beef although this seems like a great product it is definitely not minced . the cans say it is minced but it isn't , it is ground beef . my cat only likes minced . not chunks , not ground . although she will eat ground cat food sometimes , it has to be inviting and delicious , yet she just walks away from this . i hate it when the packaging lies about the contents of a product . the shipping was speedy and the value is great ( as long as they deliver what the promise ) now i am stuck with food my cat wont eat at all . 
=================
now only mildly spicy planters has reformulated these peanuts to greatly reduce there hotness and spiciness . in amazon's product image above , the peanuts appear thoroughly coated in chili pepper ; but , in the image i uploaded , you'll see that the peanuts now only have a light dusting of pepper and salt . so , be advised , before spending a fairly substantial amount for 108 packs of these peanuts , you should first buy a smaller quantity - - because they may not be what you expected . 
=================
i was missing one of the three cans i ordered . i e - mailed customer service and told them my problem and they wrote back telling me they could not ship just one can and they would ship me three more and i could return the two i had gotten . they then said to go to a site and print a return label which the site would not let me do as none of the items i bought on that order were returnable . they then asked me to tell them whether or not their answer solved my problem , i checked " no " and have never heard from them again on the subject .

good strong cup - o - joe first , let me say , i do not consider myself to be a coffee connoisseur or snob . i do not have a refined pallet . but , i do enjoy a good strong cup of coffee . the emerils bold is exactly what i was looking for . i know there are always those out there that say , " nowhere close to my custom grind and french press . " but , i use the keurig for the convenience and variety . the emerils bold is perfect for what i want - a good strong cup of coffee to start off my work day . * * * * * * * * * * * update 7 / 26 / 12i've tried a couple other " bold " coffee's , just to compare . ( brooklyn beanery fugettaboutit and jet fuel ) not all bolds are the same . the other bolds seemed more bitter . ( some people think that bitter = strong coffee . not true , strong coffee = good coffee , bitter coffee = bad coffee . ) i'm done experimenting with different brands . for a good , strong cup of coffee , emeril's big easy bold will be my go to coffee from now on . also , i just want to make one more comment on defective k - cups . i see alot of reviews for both emeril's and other k - cups saying saying that they are horrible because 1 in every 3 explode in their keurig machine . my wife and i go through 60 - 70 k - cups per month , since december 2011 . we've never had a problem with any of them . ( when i say 60 - 70 , they're not all emeril's bold - we would be bouncing off the walls . we also use caribou breakfast blend , decaf , green tea , heral tea , and hot cocoa . )

my dogs liked them but . . . . . . . judging by the list of junk food ingredients i wouldn't give them enough to even try to see a difference in their dental health . but my dogs are raw fed and very picky about any grain based " treats " and they gobbled these down in a heartbeat . they're a good snack but i wouldn't rely on them for any kind of dental health and they certainly are no substitute for brushing their teeth . 
=================
the original i've been drinking two leaves and a bud ever since a friend gave me a box to try a couple months back . i haven't bothered with other teas after that . i have it on a daily basis . the reviews regarding the " snails " that were in the packaging are from a while ago . no photos were provided , so it's hard to say how truthful they are or rather if their assumptions were correct ( are you sure it was snails ? ) and even if that was the case , i'm sure by this point the matter has been resolved . i can't imagine two leaves and a bud disregarding such a quality control mistep . i'm drinking a cup of their chamomile tea as i write this review . there's nothing wrong with it . the familiar taste is there . get your kettle ready ! 
=================
not bitter at all and plenty delicious ! i have been making cappuccinos for about a year with my dolce gusto piccolo , and decided to see if i could save money by ordering the " espresso " capsules and frothing my own milk in my capresso frothpro , which i already had from trying to make cappuccinos in another espresso maker that didn't do foam well , so i bought this milk foamer to do the trick and it is wonderful . after brewing my dolce gusto espresso , i finish it off with the milk i foamed and then i sprinkle a little cinnamon / sugar mixture that i keep in a shaker on top of the foam . everyone thinks it looks very professional and the taste is fabulous ! there is no bitterness with this espresso capsule , which i was surprised to find . the crema is lovely and the aroma is heavenly , so i was so happy to find that it tastes as good as it looks ! i like a mug - sized cup of coffee , so i usually use two capsules , which is why i decided to try using the espresso capsules instead of the latte or cappuccino ones , where i would need 4 capsules ( 2 coffee & 2 milk ) . what would cost me $ 4 at starbucks is now costing me 88 cents for the double , and when i only want a single , it only costs me 44 cents ! 
=================
milo kitchen chicken meatballs - great treats for training just got a bag of these for my two shepherd dogs for training treats . i chopped them into smaller pieces to feed as rewards . my dogs' enthusiasm greatly increased after they tasted these new treats . i took these meatballs to my dogs' agility classes . many of the dogs belonging to other people were very interested in what was in my waist treat pouch . so , i ended up passing out meatballs to other people in the class for their dogs . many of the dogs had become somewhat tired in the heat of the day . after their people gave them bits of the milo chicken meatballs treats , suddenly they all perked up and seemed to have renewed energy . so i am saying each of my dogs give this a " two paws up " and it seems the others in their classes agreed . i normally only buy food or treats without artificial ingredients , fillers , preservatives , or nitrates . there is a preservative , bha , a synthetic antioxidant . it is used as a preservative for fats and oils in many foods containing meat and fish . good news is they are made in the u . s . 
=================
great blueberry taste but not a favorite of mine i love granola and i love kind products but the vanilla blueberry clusters were not a favorite of mine . the blueberry flavor was great . tasted like fresh blueberries but the vanilla taste was a little off and the granola itself tasted a little stale . it didn't have a balanced flavor either . i was either hit with blueberry , vanilla or oats . the flavors competed instead of complimenting .

worse than even tab , tastes like battery acid i don't know how any human being can consume stuff like this and tab . its like drinking battery acid . this stuff will eat the lining of your stomach in a matter of a few years . you'd have to be nutty to drink this stuff . apparantly this stuff is a big hit with retired servicemen in germany , as sales of diet rite have increased 3000 % in some german provinces lately . in fact , upon fears of hoarding of diet rite , the german government recently raided a house of a retired american serviceman named mikey and found him sitting in his basement , nude , amidst hundreds of cases of diet rite cola , boxes and boxes of zagnut candy bars , watching terrible second rate movies about time travel and german fisting porn . that is some wild and wacky stuff .

traverse bay dried cherries i ordered two packages of cherries , one for myself and one for a family member at another address . the box of cherries delivered to my family member was stolen ( through usps ) and i contacted amazon . com as well as the us post office in their region and the package could not be found even with a tracking number . amazon . com replaced the package with no questions asked and only charged me for the initial package that was stolen . i would use amazon . com again and have since purchased other items .

very small bag but good cookies ! i love these cookies . the package was very small . i would say the bag of cookies was the size of the palm of my hand ( petite lady ) . so , for the size and price i would not buy this size again for this price . but overall again , the product is yummy !

won't makes cats sick , gives them shiny coats . cats are like children ; they will pick the tasty junk that makes them throw up over the tasteless good stuff that makes their coats shiny . they refuse to eat any wet canned flavor of this brand , much like a child will refuse to eat brussels sprouts . unfortunately unlike children you can't force - feed or bribe a cat . cats , fortunately , are not as picky about cereal as they are wet food . this is on par with wellness dry food , but had the benefit of not crumbling into powder . we feed ours this cereal with wet food from wellness & natural balance . remember ; cats are carnivores ; they cannot digest corn , wheat , tapioca , fruit , or vegetables ( except seaweed & grass ) ; all of that stuff is filler that just makes them poop more & has negative effects on their digestive tracts . 
=================
good taste , but full of shell pieces i ordered two boxes , one each of the almond coconut and date walnut . tasted decent enough but both are chock full o' nut shells . i took some walnut shell shrapnel to the the gum line and my wife pulled it out with a pair of hemostats . it was almost 1 / 8th " long and looked like a sabre tooth fang . can't take any more chances on the rest . chew with extreme prejudice .

they don't like it , but they eat it my cats aren't very fond of the taste . it took forever to get them to switch to this food . when i give them this , they leave it in the bowl and pick at it all day . if i give them their old food , they'll eat all of it within half an hour . perhaps that's better , and will help keep their weight down . i did not notice a difference in their coat or the smell of their litter box . there was two or three weeks of vomiting before fully switching over though . which was gross to say the least . i have found that my cats eat much much less than the recommended amount on the bag . took one star off because they only tolerate it . 
=================
it's ok , but it's no cadbury just personal taste but this tastes too plain sweet , not chocolaty enough . reminds me very much of cheap easter bunny chocolate . if you like your chocolate really rich , and more chocolate than sugar , cadbury dairy milk is the best .

not bad i don't like strong coffee at all and normally the only kind of coffee i drink is tim hortons . the gevalia signature blend is a medium coffee that even i don't mind .

so , what happened to all the cinnamon altoids ? ? ? ? as the other reviewers described , cinnamon altoids is becoming scarce ! we are in a drought ! they don't have cinnamon altoids at the club stores . . . nor at our favorite discounter with the red ball logo . . . better stock up before it's too late ! : p
=================
what is that smell ? ? true , the beans were huge , moist and plump , with a good mixture of really big fat ones and smaller skinny ones . however , the most noticeable aroma coming from the bag and the beans is best described as pungent , with a side of sour . is that normal ? ! ? i've only ever used the crappy dried out grocery store version , and was thrilled when i saw such a good deal on these . can a vanilla bean expert tell me if that odd , unpleasant aroma is what i'm supposed to be smelling ? ? 
=================
no lasting power i tried this litter at the suggestion on someone's suggestion in the grocery . it lasted a long time for him and his multi - cat household and locked in all the odors . unfortunately , it didn't work well for me . kitty didn't mind it and there was no dust flying up when i scooped out the stinky solids and fluffed the litter ( huge plus ) , but if i didn't change it every 5 - 7 days , the yellow - soaked grains would start to smell stale and then downright stinky . the stuff costs too much for that . i tried fresh step extreme instead and that stuff is amazing . of course , i have to contend with the dust , but again , kitty doesn't mind it and it smells fresh and masks the odors of the waste as i remove it . i only change it once every 3 - 4 weeks , but i do clean her box everytime she uses it . 
=================
are you kidding me ? ? ? maybe i am a coffee snob ? we brew starbucks house blend properly ; 2 tablespoons / 6oz water . i wa looking for something more affordable but i guess you really do what you pay for . we brewed a pot of this and my wife and i looked at each other and she used the perfct word to describe it : " sour " ! ! ! i drink it black , she with cream but the cream couldn't conceal the sourness . amazon is my first place to go for reviews but never again for coffee !

on the strong side the flavors of these are a bit on the strong side . wish i hadn't bought so many . . . i thought i would love them since parmesan and garlic are two of my favorite flavors . oh well . . .

old drrrrrrrrrrrry beans when coffee was being ground i could tell the beans were old and dried out , not a good flavor or or even much of any flavor at all , save your money on this company . call company and they made restitution .

a little hard if you have old teeth these may be a little hard . loose fillings may crack . you can't pop half in your mouth and chow down . need to go slow . they are expensive , too . don't get me wrong , i just ordered two more boxes . they are tasty as can be !

the cat's meow all four of my cats loved this canned cat food ! the food in each can really looked and smelled as if a human being could eat the food . the seasame chicken entree and chicken pot pie entree were both very popular with my cats . neither flavor smelled bad . the chicken pot pie entree was kind of runny , but my cats really enjoyed lapping up the juice . i've feed my cats a few cans of each flavor , and none of them have got the diarrhea from the food . their stomachs seem to tolerate the food quite well . i've had probelms in the past with canned cat food causing stomach and other digestive problems for my cats . according to the can's list of ingredients , all the ingredients are natural - no by - products are used . while the food is not organic , at least the food doesn't use by - products . no wheat gluten is used either . i went to the company's website and found that the company uses only dolphin safe tuna and does not use any child labor . none of the ingredients come from china , which has a horrible record on food safety . the cat food is made in thailand , but as far as i know , thailand does not have a poor record of food safety , and thai people do love their pet cats , i sure thai pet owners would not want to harm their cats with poor quality pet food . i personally see nothing to fear from thai cat food . i think i will be ordering more petite cusine in the future and would not hestitate recommending this food to my cat loving friends .

way too much $ $ $ $ unless you are in dire , immediate need for this , i would not recommend buying this particular item here . i literally just happened to buy this in my local stop & shop grocery store for $ 2 . 99 . yes , i triple - checked and it's the exact same item and size - 4 . 4 lbs . the product is good but the price is terrible !

gummy bear came as advertised . wish it was cheaper . bought another mold and will be making it ourselves the next time to save some cash .

great for dental care i have two small dachshunds . one was a stray with very bad teeth . she couldn't even chew dry dog food much less the harder tartar treats . i started giving the smallest dentastix to both dogs , one in the morning and one at night . by the time i took my stray back to the vet for her exam , the vet couldn't believe how much her teeth had improved . very little tartar left . she now has very little difficulty eating anything . both dogs love their treats and listen for the bag in the morning and at night .

think thin bars these bars are shipped via the u . s . post office . when i buy them in a store such as whole foods , they are fresh and the outer coatings intact . when i bought them through amazon , the outer coatings were melted and in some cases stuck to the inside of the wrappers . it is not a case where they were left in a mailbox all day . my mailman handed them to me , along with the other mail . don't buy this product from amazon , pay a little more and get a good product . 
=================
much cheaper at abbott i was about to order case of 6 from amazon . i took a few minutes to see where else i could buy it online and found that abbott has same exact thing for $ 143 ! usually this product is $ 27 / piece if bought at babies r us or target so amazon price is not a great deal . i love amazon and use it a lot but on this product they are overpriced ! 
=================
this review is actually written by my dogs ! these treats are great ! they're yummy ! they have such a perfect consistency , not too hard , not soft at all . they don't get gummy when they're chewed for awhile so mom doesn't mind picking them up after they've been chewed on for a bit . sometimes she has to do that 'cause we get obsessed with chewing them on occasion and we just won't put them down ! ( ok , i admit , that's me . . . " banshee " . i am a himalayolic but i don't need help . i just need more himalayan dog chews and mom found them at amazon . com for the best price anywhere ! ) these treats are hard and crunchy and stay that way , they only get a tiny hint of softness as chewed . we have to work at it but small pieces flake off and we get our tasty reward ! they make great dental bones because they have more flavor and have stiff edges to help rub along our teeth and break off the tarter . oh , and they don't have the foul odor of hoof chewies or some others . mom and dad gag when we chew hoofies but they love the himalayan chews . did i say they are great ? well i meant they are outstanding ! they are wonderful and all three of us love them so much that on occasion we have fought over them . that's because " zac " likes to horde them and tries to hide them all . he's stopped that now since mom worked with him . that's great because now she can leave 4 - 5 out , ( more than the number of dogs is smart ) , without worry of a fight . one warning is that you should watch your dog as they get down near the end of the chew . " li " is a real aggressive eater and when he gets to that last inch he'll swallow it whole ! one of these times i'm worried it may get stuck in his intestine and require surgery since i'm uncertain how well a large chunk will be digested . regular chunks appear to be fully digested since it never hurts going poddy and mom never complains about chunks in our poops , bol ( bark out loud ) . we've been receiving these fine treats since they first came on the market and we've had no trouble . we ( mostly ) are average to above average chewers with lots of experience with these chews and we'd recommend you try them with your dogs . like any chew , you should stick around and observe us as we chew but for light to moderate chewers you might be watching for hours and even then we may not finish one since it's highly dependent on the aggressiveness of the chewer . crazy mad chewers like " li " have been known to bite down on even the large ones and snap it in two , which is great 'cause then i get another one ! our mom watches us well and picks the chews up when she cannot watch us . i think that's smart for all chews . now , go on ! what are you waiting for ? go buy some for " max " and " hannah " !

guajillo review i have used angelina's gourmet guajillo powder , ancho powder andnew mexico aniaheim chile powder a while now and have no complaintsas to the quality or price . my only complain is that amazon's search engine always bringsup the pricier products sold by other companies if i just type in the words guajillo powder and angelina's is nowhere to be seen . but this is easily remedied by typing in ' angelina's gourmet guajillo powder 'and then all of angelina's stuff will pop up . it's worth the effort . 
=================
kix + rice crispies + corn flakes + sugar + vanilla this cereal looks like someone mixed together kix , rice crispies , and corn flakes . it tastes like they did that , then added sugar and some vanilla . i found it to be both very sweet ( the second ingredient is sugar ) and not very filling . it turned to mush within about five minutes , too , so unless you're a power - eater , it'll be soggy goop by the end of the bowl . i know that 'contents may settle' , but the bag inside the box was only half full , which seemed a bit laughable . based on what i poured in my cereal bowl , which i admit is far larger than the 'serving size' of 2 / 3 of a cup , each box contains about four breakfasts . if , however , you only eat 2 / 3 of a cup of cereal each morning , the box will last you much longer . ( the ridiculously small serving size also explains why a cereal that tastes like it's mostly sugar only has 7 grams of sugar per serving . ) there are precious few gluten - free cereals on shelves , but there has to be at least one that's better than this . 
=================
ancient harvest quinoa rotelle this pasta cooks up and tastes very much like wheat pasta . the taste is very good . i only wish i had been able to read , or explored the ingredient list further . even on the front of the box , that little white tag inset on the upper left green panel , says , " corn - quinoa " blend . so if corn is not a problem for you , it should be fine . going form wheat to corn flower is not a move in a positive direction , in my mind . it is gluten free , so if that is your main objective , this product satisfies . 
=================
no finer beverage ! of all cola beverages , rc cola is tops in taste . sadly , the dr pepper company , of which rc is a part , fails to recognize it's high qualities , and promotion of the product is not allowed ( as it is with most dp company products , except dp . . . . . when was the last time you saw a 7 - up ad ? ) . nonetheless , rc is outstanding , far superior to coke and pepsi , and is deserving of your purchase . 
=================
taco bell jalapeno sauce very very mild jalapeno flavor . you have to work hard to pick up the flavor of the jalapeno . the sauce has a creamy salad dressing thickness to it and overall this is a very neutral flavor . it's not bad , but it's not good enough to recommend . it definitely needed more jalapeno snap to it . 
=================
rishi teas are the best don't be afraid to buy any of the rishi teas ! other than sneaking off to buy some dragon pearl jasmine from numi here and there ( still pretty good but costs much less ) i buy no other teas than rishi these days . i'm in love with white teas and rishi's tickle me to my toes ! ha ! i just realized i'm drinking their mandarin citrus tea as i type this review !

far from our favorite snack i feed my baby earth's best baby food so i figured i would try some snacks that they make . i have had other flavors of the crunchin blocks and like them . however the honey ones are absolutely terrible . the first box i got tasted like chemicals so amazon . com sent me a replacement . it doesn't taste much better than the first to me . my son is not crazy about them either which says a lot because he loves his snacks ! would not buy these again . 
=================
tasty - but small and not lasting the quality of this bone has left me disappointed . it is also smaller than advertised , only about 12 inches . this is the second bone of this type that i have purchased . i will exclude the brand name of the first because i cannot remember it . it's been that long since it was purchased . granted , i bought that bone when the dog was still teething , it has lasted for close to 10 months now . at one point , i sawed it in half and gave a piece to my sister's dog because she loves it . my point is that the previous bone has withstood much more heavy chewing than the smokehouse brand . it arrived not even 36 hours ago , my dog chewing on it for about 3 of those hours , and she has already worked off one of the ball joint ends ( about 3 - 4 inches ) . she's a pitbull mix and she is just shredding through this thing . i should add that it has not made her sick and she does enjoy it greatly . however , if you are under the impression that this bone will last for a while , you will be disappointed .

consistent good performing seeds i bought these last year and they performed equally well . highly recommended . i bought lavender seeds from several companies this year . here are the results : very satisfied with these two brands . . . botanical interests' french 'purple ribbon' lavender : these seeds sprang up two days after planting . i was pretty amazed . renee's english lavender : was the second lot to spring up a few days after botanical interests' . consistently good . poorest . . . lavender seeds french perfume : one plant has shown . and one grass blade . this company sent 10 seeds in their big fancy packet . ten . other companies send much more than this . with a 90 % failure rate , i would not recommend this company . hinterland trading co . blue lavender : nothing . not a single seed has shown up yet . not even a 'hinter' of any of them coming either . i definitely would not recommend this company . hope this helps others looking for lavender seeds .

way overpriced i absolutely love this cat food . since my cats have been on it the change in their coats is remarkable . they also leave way less solids in the cat box since there is no corn in it . it is great for cats with urinary tract issues as well . my complaint is the price they have listed . . . . ridiculous ! at a local pet store i pay $ 35 for the 12 pound bag and even petco , which is listed in the ad has it cheaper . 
=================
yummoh ! ! i moved to the east coast six years ago and must say that i have missed this particular treat . i couldn't wait for my order and dug right into the box upon delivery . the candy is chocked full of peanuts . . . no skimping there at all . the praline type candy surrounding the nuts simply melted like spun sugar in my mouth . i had to kiss my diet goodbye . i devoured the entire box in five days . . . little piggy that i am . imagine my dissapointment when i tried to re - order and it wasn't availble ! next time i'll be certain to make it last . enjoy ! ! i know i did !

5 times the price = 1 / 5 rating this excellent tea comes from the uk where it costs about $ 3 ( 50 bags ) at supermarkets . a few purchases like this ( $ 19 including shipping ? ? ) may well add up to a ticket to london . fortunately , the leaf version of the same tea is available at a decent price from amazon .

chocolate a 5 , but customer service a 0 when i lived in wisconsin , i was a big fan of this choc . after moving overseas , i sent emails to the company asking about how to get it , or even act as exporter for it ! but answer came there none ( to borrow a lewis carroll phrase . ) such a pity . 
=================
no more stale chips . cheap ! mine came with stickers to sell them for $ 1 . 59 but they cost more like $ 1 . 25 so if for retail that is not much of a mark up . i bought these for myself so that doesn't really matter and they are cheap . similar to lay's but cheaper . unlike other knockoffs these seemed to taste fresher and the convenient size minimizes stale chips . great product . great price .

quenches popcorn thirsts on hot days , and continues carnival romances a & w root beer . cold , with aged vanilla . the taste is familiar , sweet . . . a flavor we all knew just moments after leaving the womb . the can's metal has changed throughout the years , but its inner truth remains . my mettle , though , to sip from it again quivers . in my hand is a crushed can . empty , of course , as it has been for three years when it fell half full . i found it almost buried under mud and thistle , barely revealed in the sun . until yesterday , the can rested aside the bench near where the popcorn stand barkers clamored their chorus . i met nancy in line just as the county fair was closing for the season . she was traveling , she said , through town on business , and i was just traveling , though this was my hometown . i never learned which town was hers , or what she did , but i knew she loved gardenias . she had never seen one , but was she sure would if she did . i never met anyone with her quiet smile , and stammered in awe that we might sit for a while . we did . the heat of august , and the popcorn's salty butter gave way to root beer . there is no nutrition in a & w root beer . just 170 calories and a bit of sodium . not much more . i bought us each one , and we talked until the light's turned off . she looked at her watch , and ran , dropping her drink . she never said good - bye . no one has sat there since . why would they ? the fair moved elsewhere , and now , it is just a lot with occasionally mowed weeds . i found it while wandering . i hosed the can off , now flat and wrinkled but fully colored . " since 1919 " it says in brown letters . three years is long enough . 91 years ? i don't know what to do with it . i never did . may your root beer always be cold , and your time be eternal . - - brockeim

ridiculously expensive . . . . . . . . but what can you do . $ 10 bucks for 4 ounces is ridiculous , but if you need it , and cant get it locally , what choice do you have ? needed it for smoking and curing salmon filets so it worked . but i'm going to have to find a different recipe for smoking and curing . i just cant afford these prices in the future . if it was 80z or 120z , i could swallow that . . . . . . . . . . . but even filet mignon isn't this expensive .

cheesecake may spoil during delivery i got a 6 month cheesecake order as a gift , and the first cheeesecake arrived packed in dry ice . it was frozen and tasted great after a night in the fridge . the second cheesecake arrived spoiled . they did not ensure rapid delivery of the cake and the dry ice melted while the cake was in transit . when i called the company and asked for a replacement , they said that would be impossible , and that i would have to pick another product . i asked to speak to a manager and the manager acted like it was my fault that the cake spoiled in transit , and said i was lucky that they were willing to give me anything . i've ordered other month clubs from other companies in the past , and never once had an item spoil prior to delivery . and on the very rare occasion a product arrived damaged , other companies were very willing to make it up to me . amazing clubs made it very clear they had no interest in customer satisfaction . 
=================
pumpkin spice , emphasis on the spice i bought this syrup because my partner loves everything pumpkin . i thought i'd try it out to make pumpkin lattes and potentially use it to flavor other things . however , when tasted it , i was overwhelmed by cinnamon . i like cinnamon , but i felt the " spice " completely overpowered the pumpkin . just in case the flavor would mellow when combined with food i tried it in a latte . the cinnamon still predominated and my drink had such a strong aftertaste i actually couldn't finish it . to be fair , i often find pre - flavored coffees to have an undesirable aftertaste as well , but i've had good luck with various syrups and additives . . . for instance , i can't stand irish creme flavored coffee , but i quite enjoy the occasional coffee with an actual shot of irish creme . i'm not saying the syrup is of bad quality , it's just that i feel it's important to let folks know exactly what they're in for . summary : i can't really taste the pumpkin over all the spice . . . very strong presence of cinnamon . 
=================
not too bad if you have never tried durian and are curious , these freeze dried pieces don't smell too bad - - not as bad as durian jam - - but they don't taste good either . the texture of of durian is one of the nice things about it , and it's lost when dried . these taste like dried dirty old gym socks .

i don't hate it last night i tried this product according to the instructions . my oven was at the right temperature , and i baked for just over 12 minutes ( around 157 degrees according to my tests ) . and i tried it with some center - cut pork chops with the bone in , which should have made the resulting dish better than if i'd chosen plain old no - bone pork chops , but 100 % of the three people who consumed these chops agreed they would have preferred them with no coating at all . one person said that the one part of her chop that i missed coating with the product on one side was the single best bite she took . another tester said she wished i had merely seared the two surfaces of the chops and left off the coating altogether . i myself appreciated the crunch of this coating , but every bite had an off flavor that i would prefer had not been there . i too would have preferred no coating at all to the coating this product added to the pork chops . in case you're interested , here's the ingredients list . enriched wheat flour ( wheat flour , niacin , iron , thiamin mononitrate ( vitamin b1 ) , riboflavin ( vitamin b2 ) , folic acid ) , salt , canola oil , sugar , spice , contains less than 2 % of caramel color , dried onions , dextrose , yeast , extractives of paprika , ascorbic acid . i think you can whip up a reasonable substitute - - except for the caramel color - - by mixing flour and ground corn meal with salt and paprika , and i'd add some pepper if i were you unless you don't want me to . why shake ? also , i'm not sure why you should bother to put the coating and the chops into a zip - top bag and shake them , especially since you must supply the bag , and especially especially since you must discard it immediately since it's coated in raw pork ick and which also adds maybe 15 cents to the price of the product . why can't you just dump the 2 . 25 ounces of coating onto a plate and dredge ? i get the bake part of shake 'n bake , but i don't get the shake part . the package says to buy four to six half - inch - thick pork chops , and i bought one for each of us three diners plus one extra for a total of - - just a moment while i whip out my spreadsheet here - - four . as you can see from the photograph i've thoughtfully added , they were pretty big chops , and there was not nearly enough coating to have done the last one , not to mention a fifth and sixth . this morning for breakfast i fried the emergency backup pork chop in a little butter but obviously with no coating , and it was much more agreeable than the coated one last night . as a result , i conclude that this product needs improvement , and i rate it two stars . i'd rate it one star , but that means that i literally hate it , which is a bit strong . i just have no immediate or even long - term plans to use it again . in case you were wondering , as i can attest from having run the experiments for you , this product does not improve the flavor or texture of tapioca , a mocha latte , or vanilla ice cream ( or probably any other flavor , but vanilla was all we had ) . - - update : i don't see where we reviewers can add photos to the product page , so i take back what i said above about " the photograph i've thoughtfully added . " maybe later . - - update of august 8 , 2011 : i've now been able to add the photo , so please stop emailing me asking when the heck i'm going to get it posted .

cooking fanatic the boxes are smaller than i expected . they look really cute on the counter . i also bought the butchers salt and the gardeners salt . it is too bad that they do not package them together as a trio . i have two houses so it was not a big deal for me to have two of each . they were not packed very well when shipped and arrived somewhat damaged , i had to glue two of the boxes back together . the salt is of medium coarseness , the salt to herb ratio is 3 / 4 to 1 / 4 respectably . it's not a great deal initially but the boxes are reusable and it is quite easy to make more using the ingredient list on the side of each box !

not found in stores ! ! ! ! - not any stores around here , anyway . . . not anymore . this is by far my favorite pasta roni and i used to buy it all the time . then , without warning , it disappeared ! poof ! i just figured they had discontinued it . one day , on a whim , i visited the pr website and saw to my delight that this flavor was still listed . i did a search and , well , that is when amazon grocery came into my life . now i buy a case of it here and there ; i'm not an addict - i can stop anytime i want to . but why would i want to ? ! ? i love the thicker linguine noodles and the sauce flavor is oh - so tasty . so chicken - y and so brocolish - y . you should buy some right now ! wait a minute . if everyone else buys some , there might not be enough for me . i mean , amazon has run out before and i had to sign up on some lame notification list that , surprise surprise , didn't notify me when it was back in stock . never mind ! nobody buy this product ! it's terrible . nothing to see here . just go buy your stupid white shells & cheddar ! that is all .

very small quantity , poor growth i got these dehydrated kefir grains two weeks ago . when re - hydrated there was a very tiny amount of actual grains . i put them in a jar with milk on a seedling mat to keep them the right temperature ( our house is cool at night ) and was very careful , and yet the milk kept curdling because there weren't enough grains , or just going yeasty . and they're growing very , very slowly . two weeks later and i have a half teaspoon of grains . so far the milk has never smelled anything like kefir . in desperation i started adding some kefir powder and kefir , thinking that maybe they'd pick up some missing bacteria . also , the instructions are misleading when they talk about it taking two weeks to " rehydrate " . what you're doing is growing them to the point that you have enough to actually make kefir . i'm starting to think that dehydrated grains are a bad idea . but at the very least they ought to give you enough of them , instead of the tiny amount . because it didn't seem like it was working very well , i ordered two tablespoons of live kefir grains from another vendor . they arrived yesterday , and i put them in milk . today i think i have almost a quarter cup of grains . they seem to have already grown noticeably . out of curiosity i'm still going to try to get these grains to work . i'm going to try a much smaller amount of milk so the kefir grains aren't overwhelmed . i'll update this review if it ever works .

trappist abbey fruitcake for years i have looked for a " store - bought " fruitcake that lived up to the ones made by my mother and grandmother when i was young . this is it ! my only regret is that i didn't get to lick the bowl after they poured the batter into the pan .

dieter's dream if you are on a diet or looking to cut calories and fat , fiber one's line of snack bars will be a dream come true . the chocolate and caramel ones are on the sweet side , so go for peanut butter if you can't handle such a sweet taste . i don't care for the apple flavored ones because of their plastic , fake taste and haven't tried strawberry . these bars contain 35 % of your rda for fiber which is great ! they should not give you digestion issues unless you get very little fiber normally or if you eat more than one a day . but do pay attention to the ingredient and nutrition lists . this is not health food ! they are high in sugar , carbs , and have ingredients like shellac , ethanol , and hydrogenated oil . this is junk food that happens to have some redeeming qualities . 5 stars for taste and 3 for health factors . overall , i give it a 4 . 
=================
looses flavor too quickly i wish the flavor would last longer . a few months ago i quit using products with artifical sweeteners , which is how i found this gum . since the flavor is gone in under a minute , i keep popping in a new piece & trash the old . i like the crunch when you first bite into it . i end up going through it way too fast and will probably try and wean myself off gum completly ( if i can ) .

sweet and savory basket i sent this as a gift . my sister , the recipient , said that the packaging was lovely , but that was the best part of the basket . the food inside was scimpy and not the quality you would expect from a gift basket . i would not send this to anyone else or purchase it for myself . 
=================
too bland , needs to be spiced up . i am all for healthy soups , but the taste of this one is far too bland . i added some sea salt , peppercorns and roasted seaweed to make it palatable . the end result is pretty good , thus the four stars , otherwise it would've gotten one .

greenies is a treat , not a dental / oral product ! first , my cat loves this treat . however , it is definitely not a dental product as the manufacturer advertised . there is no enzyme in greenies that would promote dental health . the size of the treat is pretty standard compares to other brands of cat treats , so there is no need for the cat to chew on it ( my cat swallows it in 2 seconds ) , which means greenies does not " brush off " the tartar either . i took my cat to the vet few months ago for professional dental cleaning . after the treatment , the vet gave me some handouts about dental care for cats , and explained to me that greenies does not promote dental care . instead , the vet recommends the cet chews for cats . however , the vet says , nothing beats brushing your cat's teeth at least every other day . so , if you are looking for an oral hygiene chews , look somewhere else , however , if you just want to please your cat , greenies does make a tasty treat !

great packaging ; fair coffee i love the way this is packaged ( other than , as others have noted , you need to keep the k - cups in a resealable bag , so they're not quite as convenient as traditional k - cups in terms of storage ) . but the coffee is only so - so . had several others try it , and they were not impressed , either - - they liked the packages but didn't like the coffee . 
=================
not for the squeemish . i like this brand of ramen . they make authentic flavors and they are made in the us . while i like seafood i was a bit taken aback my the chunks of dehydrated tuna and anchovy in this soup . i think i'll stick with their spicy kimchi which is awesome
=================
love the product disappointed in the content received we ordered a 6 pk of the glutino multigrain crackers and was excited that the cost per box was cheaper than our local stores . the box arrived with bubble wrap and when we open the 1st foil pa lager inside the box mostly all crackers were in pieces . we decided to see if that was the case for all and 4 out of 6 boxes were in usable for entertaining as none of the crackers were whole . great if we're using it to make bread crumbs but not to seatbelt during the holidays . would not order again . 
=================
soup that i wished i had tasted ! i have not had a chance to try this soup . when it arrived , all the packages , all 4 of them , were torn open and there is no way that i can seperate the contents to make the soup . it sounds delicious , but i have no way of knowing . i wish the people who make this product would send me another to try at their expense and sealed in a better way . actually , i have no real true way to give it any stars as much as i would like to .

may have caused hives i say the food " may " have caused hives because i cannot be sure it was related to this food but it definitely could have been . . . my 9 month female boxer first started with tiny bumps which got worse over a period of 3 weeks . not long after our larger male boxer puppy started getting large red hives on his face also . the only thing different about their diet was this food . at first we did not think this was from the food ( they were on it 2 weeks before any symptoms ) and tried every other avenue to locate the cause of the hives , bug bits , fleas , recently washed bedding etc . . . after looking to every other area for the cause and the hives only getting worse and worse we stopped feeding them this food altogether . it has only been 2 days since we switched them over to a natural balance l . i . t . allergy formula and so far the hives have stopped from getting any worse . its still too soon to say for sure this was the cause but at least the hives seem to be slowing !

not very delicious but effective took some getting used to - - at first i joked that it tasted like a liquid crouton . after a while , though , you get used to the taste . took it for health reasons . . . whether it was the tea or something else , the issue went away . definitely not something i'd drink every day but if necessary , it's tolerable . note : putting honey in it makes it worse . and hot is preferable to iced .

something you can't un - taste , if your a man or animal you can't un - taste this goup . the reviewers who said this stuff has the consistency of frosting are right , but it doesn't taste like frosting . here is a true story that pretty much sums up this product : my sister's dog loves to eat everything , especially peanut butter . i swear , her dog takes one sniff of this stuff and runs the other way . he won't touch it ! and this dog loves peanut butter more than anything ! that tells me all i need to know . 
=================
inaccurate list of ingredients - not gluten or soy free if you have celiac disease or soy allergies , this is not the perfect soup you were hoping to find . the list of ingredients on amazon is not correct ! ! my children have celiac disease and soy allergies . i thought i had found the perfect soup . i was sadly mistaken . the listed ingredients here on amazon ( and on the manufacturer's website ) is different from the cans that arrived in the mail from amazon . the picture looks the same , but the ingredients are not . this soup is not soy free ( contains soy sauce ) or gluten free ( yeast extract and natural flavors ) . here's what the can label actually lists : " filtered water , organic mushrooms , organic cream ( from milk ) , organic rice flour , organic mushroom concentrate ( organic mushrooms , organic soy sauce [ organic soybeans , organic maltodextrin ] , organic mushroom powder , organic butter [ organic cream , lactic acid ] , organic molasses , yeast extract , organic potato flour , organic flavor , natural flavor ) , organic rice starch , salt , natural flavors , organic canola oil , organic onion powder , organic parsley , organic white pepper , organic thyme . contains milk and soy " notice it doesn't warn about the possible wheat / gluten from the yeast extract or natural flavors . i called the manufacturer to find out if their organic soy sauce contains wheat . they claim it does not . they could not guarantee that the " natural flavors " wouldn't contain gluten . i wouldn't risk it if you have celiac disease . i forgot to ask them about the yeast extract sources .

swiss misses with new and improved hot chocolate's last savior perished today in a pathetic attempt to cut corners on quality . now it can join great value brand with the comfort and knowledge that it saved a nickel a box .

no interest my dog loves dogswell sweet potato chews , which i recently learned are made in china . i had hoped that these sam's yams would make a good substitute . however , these are much tougher , really like rawhide , and my cockapoo has no interest in the product . i'm not even sure she realizes that it is something to eat . maybe it would appeal to a larger dog that enjoys chewing . 
=================
no scoop ! this is the second pacific health brand i have used , the first being the orange flavored accelerade . i tried this one because it has less sugar . it also has less protein , which i didnt know until i got it , my bad for not checking ahead of time . the product taste fine , but it did not come with a scoop , which i found odd , especially since the directions state that one serving size is one scoop . maybe i just got the one can that didnt have a scoop . overall a good product .

excellent rice , but the online pricing is way too high ! we love this rice ! you could purchase this rice at your local indian market for far less . we purchase 20lb royal bags for less than $ 20 at our local warehouse . two star rating is for high pricing . 
=================
way too expensive i have just bought at bj's a box of 80 k - cups ( green mountain 100 % colombian dark roast extra bold ) for $ 37 ( that is 46 . 25 cents per cup ) . i found it similarly priced at sam's . do the math and compare . the moral of this comparison is that not everything is cheaper at amazon specially when amazon is only the middle man , so to speak . 
=================
does not taste like bleach it's not bad . i'm a big fan of green tea and lipton's brand does a good job at matching the quality of japanese brands . the leaves inside the bad are cut into smaller and finer pieces than japanese ones but that doesn't seem to affect the taste that much . if you like green tea , you should definitely give this a try . it is a lot cheaper than anything else out there at this level of quality .

coombs vs highland vs now ( winner on food ! ) , grade b syrup . . . i have all three in my frige , so i did taste test " s " ? - 1 . just pouring straight into a spoon / tasting ? - coombshighlandnow2 . heated 1 / 8cup ( all 3 ) , mixed in 1tsp of lando'lakes butter ( canola ) , and poured onto 3 eggo blueberry waffles ? - now shines " on food " ! - i can really taste the yummy maple , and not too sweet ! : o ) coombs was just ok - the maple was very mild , but the sugary sweetness was overpowering ( ala mrs . butterworth's ( hfcs ! ) ) . highland - virtually tasteless , and i tossed it . 
=================
cryptic instruction this package contains two large pieces of folded paper , the trap frames , which are obvious . also some small but essential pieces which are less obvious . the instructions are in various places ; a bit like putting together a jigsaw puzzle where you have no idea what the result should be . eventually i thought i had it right and then placed the traps . tonight i found another piece , no idea what it does . modern product design is supposed to accomodate both people who speak english ( i do ) as well as people who have a limited command of it . this needs to go back to the drawing board on that score . what they could do to improve would be walk around ikea a bit , and then redesign their instructions so that zero words are used , and the instructions are in one single place . or at least take a focus group of people entirely unfamiliar with moth traps and rate them on their ability to assemble this . i don't know whether i have put it together correctly or not , but so far the traps are empty . if you have prior experience with this product this review may sound silly ; there aren't that many pieces and somebody who has done it once correctly can probably assemble them in 5 seconds flat .

like fudge smells and tastes like freshly baked white chocolate fudge . one thing to be aware of is that the tea bags are unevenly flavored . some of them taste very strong and some rather weak while most of them are in between . 
=================
no sour taste at all before trying this product , i tried making a native starter , just picking up whatever yeast was flying around in the air in austin , texas . that worked from a functional point of view , but had no sour flavor . in the process , i got myself a nice glass jar ( formerly a clausen pickle jar ) punched holes in the lid . i made sure to use wooden utensils when mixing . i went to the baby aisle of the grocery store and got a bottle of distilled water to make sure there would be no chlorine present . everything worked as described all over the place . . . very active starter . . . somewhat slow rising . . . pretty good bread texture . . . just no sour flavor . so i purchased this product . i followed the instructions carefully , feeding every 12 hours , using a glass container , stirring with wooden chopsticks and using distilled water . it took three days to activate and another day or two to get very reliable . . . and at that point it was . . . . indistinguishable from the local starter . no sour aroma or flavor whatsoever . in other words , a packet containing 1 / 2 tsp of ordinary flour would have worked equally well . 
=================
not for summer shipping don't order chocolate in the summer ! because i had experienced the pomegranate / chocolate pieced before , i know the product is yummy , but the little nuggets had been turned into one big chunk of crumbly chocolate by the time it arrived at my house . very disappointing . 
=================
more than it's worth i first began using the roasted barley to make a beverage almost thirty years ago while learning hapkido . it is good for the heart , stabilizes the pancreas , and works as a fat emulsifier . it goes well with roasted corn to make an even more healthful drink . i would suggest buying it from a local korean , chinese or japanese market . i just got 4 bags of roasted corn and the roasted barley for less than $ 9 . then you can either brew it whole on the stove , or grind it and brew it in a french press . both ways work well . adding sugar or honey diminishes some of the health benefits . in spring and summer i have it at room temperature . if it is cold outside i drink it warm . either way is great . try 4 tablespoons to a quart of water . 
=================
my dogs love it , but the ingredient list gives me paws . . . ahem , pause chef michael might be a fictional character in the same vein as aunt jemima and the keebler elves , but that doesn't excuse him from putting some truly nasty ingredients into his grilled sirloin dry dog food . so many other reviewers have pointed out the list of dubious ingredients that it doesn't pay to duplicate them again , but i urge you to take a long , hard look at that list before you commit to purchasing this item . nutrition aside , this is a very tasty food item based on my dogs' response to finding it in their bowl . frankly , they went bonkers over chef michael's grilled sirloin dry dog food . i'm probably not going to make this part of their regular diet , but i will continue using it as a treat . 
=================
great item , disappointing price & shipping service from amazon love these treats for my puppy and my veterinarian was pleased with this product since the pup is slightly overweight and made in the usa , unfortunately they are quite pricey . but when i started on the automatic monthly shipments from amazon at the reduced price , amazon cancelled the automatic shipments before the first shipment , for whatever reason , so now i have to buy them at the full higher price . i guess someone wanted more money so i will have to either buy them less frequently or find somewhere else to get them at a better price or look for something else . how sad for my puppy , she really , really enjoys these treats . 
=================
so - so product with high shipping costs the taste of this product is so - so . it is easy to mask with cream cheese , nut butters or anything else for that matter . however , considering that trader joes sprouted bread tastes great and only has 7 net grams of fiber per slice , i will stick with that . pop a couple of fiber pills and you can get the net carbs down to 2 if you are really counting carbs that closely . 
=================
at least i can say i tried it . i'm interested in trying new things , especially when they sound completely different , so when i heard of banana ketchup i had to do it . i don't really know what i was expecting , but it is exactly what it sounds like . if you don't want to pay more than the product is worth in shipping just to sample it , try putting regular tomato ketchup on a banana . if that sounds like your thing , you'll probably love banana ketchup . if not . . . well . . . at least you can say you tried it too .

it made my hair fall out at first i loved everything about this shampoo and conditioner . it smelled great , my hair was manageable , it curled perfectly . then my hair started falling out . a few strands extra here and there . but my family starting saying mom your hair is everywheres . then the clumps started coming out . i have stopped using the s & c the clumps are still coming and i am forced to swish my foot over the drain thru my entire shower . hopefully it will stop i really enjoy having hair . 
=================
not red vines ! ! these haribo wheels are made in spain , the ones from france or germany are better hence the 4 star rating . most important is that they are actually " like " licorice , unlike the red vines crap that fall apart once in your mouth and taste like - - who knows , can't place the horrible taste . thes are a safe choice .

folgers is better i got this coffee at a local market when our whole beans stocks dwindled . . . . my husband and i are both coffee 'snobs' we had to wean ourselves of our peets habit when we moved from california last year . this coffee is sub - standard , dried out , tasting of dish water . instead . . . try a green mountain coffee like the espresso blend or the newmans blends

not enough time for full evaluation . our ckd raskal did eat some , and the other 3 normal cats had some also . all we put out was eaten . unfortunately raskal was already stage 4 when we received it , and passed after only 2 small bowls so the remainder will be donated to a local shelter .

pretty decent : but could be a little better well my mother has a couple cats so i thought what the heck i'll get this stuff for her to feed them instead of hard food all the time . the cats who will eat anything and everything that you put in front of them were little apprehensive of this product . granted the one cat does like spicy food but he did eat it throughout the days . they both like it but it's hard for them to get a hold of the pieces because the chicken is kind of stringy and not cut into smaller pieces and some of it ends up on the floor . but now that they kind of used to these they do definitely practically yell at me when i don't give them the stuff as soon as i open the can , lol . but it would be better if it were smaller cut pieces to reduce the amount that ends up on the floor . 
=================
leaves an after - taste i applied this rub onto a pork shoulder and let it sit overnight in the fridge . i smoked it for 10 hours the next day and the meat turned out fabulously . the rub gave a definite spice to the shoulder but i found it heavy on the paprika and somewhat sour with an after - taste . the ingredients were very straightforward and pretty much what you find in almost all of the rub recipes online but i think i'd prefer a little sweetness to complement the meat . next time i'll try mixing my own spices but it'd be handier to have everything pre - mixed . 
=================
i love goat milk , but too bad . . . . too bad this stuff in general ranks high on the inflammation triggering foods . i'm trying to follow a low inflammation diet . i do love the taste of goats milk . it's very rich and creamy . the liquid is better than the powder . 
=================
savored every drop i am lucky to live in an area with a large asian community , and we have an excellent malaysian restaurant that we visit frequently , and many asian groceries . therefore , i've been able to try several varieties of randang curry , from both of these types of places . this is the best version of homemade that i have ever tried . i'm sure that the addition of several of the traditional spices of the region ( pandan leaf , lemongrass , and kafir lime leaf , among others ) is what gives it that restaurant quality taste . what is also similar to a restaurant version , unfortunately is the calorie and fat content . . . and this doesn't even include the meat , approximately 1600 per box , so take that into consideration when determining portion size . i would suggest you stretch it with some vegetables , potatoes , peas or broccoli would all go well with this . also read the allergy advisory on the packaging if you have any issues with nuts , shellfish , fish sesame , eggs , soy or mik . i am pleased that they do not add msg to this high quality product . enjoy , but not too much ~ 
=================
thumbs down i gave my 4 cats these treats one night . they were still there in the morning , completely untouched . i brought them to my friends house to see if her cats liked them . we gave them to her 4 cats and only one liked them . so 1 out of 8 cats approved . not a good ratio . 
=================
oops we have not received this as of yet . it is expected to be shipped in february .

service disappointment ! i tried to order more for the high freight and could not contact you or figure out how to order more for these high freight rates and so i was told by your customer serice that i had to return the shipment for a refund and i did that and have not recieved a refund . we can not get this product locally , my 2 and 4 year old grandaughters love this product . they insist in haveing the stars not the round . they will not eat anything else . after i recieve my refund i would like a call from someone to explain your very hard to figure out websight and talk to me about to satisfy my grandaughters with this product . the product needs to be in the local stores .

classic gold coast is one of the most bold of the starbucks coffee . you can take deep mouth fulls of this . has a slightly bitter flavor and extremely large mouth feel . spicy , woody , impressive . still , every coffee the mermaid makes is well balanced , and this is no exception . less adventurous drinkers can add lots of milk or cream to this and still get a bold cup . it won't take the paint off the walls - - unless you come over and let me make it .

great food , bad cs first of all , i am subscribed to receive two boxes of the variety pack every month . my cats love the food and refuse to eat other canned food . i have tried to give them more expensive , better quality food but they only want petite cuisine . that said , i am quite disappointed at p . c . 's customer service . after researching on menadione , i emailed p . c . and asked if they plan to not use menadione in near future . i never heard back from them . before this , i received an email from them with a coupon code . i tried to copy and paste the code on their web site and it didn't work . i emailed their cs and they told me that the coupon was working . come to find out , they misspelled the coupon on the email . the code contained the word " cuisine " and they misspelled it . i emailed them back about it and they didn't responded nor sent out another email with the correction . very disappointing indeed . . . in the future , if i find another brand that did not contain menadione and had better customer service , and i would instantly switch over to the new brand . well , my cats have to like the new food too , which is why i haven't able to give them something else yet . 
=================
for ethnic hair . not clearly stated though this is for ethnic hair . the marketing is a a bit poor for it , and it doesn't explicitly say so on the packaging . i thought it would be good for my thick hair for after swimming . it is not . i did , however , give to one my my friends who can benefit from it . she noted that it works very well , adding needed moisture to her hair . it is not overly greasy as many other hair products for her can be . she recommends it . 
=================
i am somwhat disappointed by the amount of oil in the product . my major gripe with the product is that there is too much oil . it can be fixed by using a colander or something else to drain the oil . also , keep in mind that the size of the can is 4lbs 6oz . you can keep the can stored in your cupboard for months if it isn't opened , but you need to consume it relatively quickly once it is opened ( just something to keep in mind for people who are single or who have small families ) . 
=================
meh . . . nuts are okay the nuts seem . . . old . you know what old filberts look like . i had hoped they would come vacuum sealed as another reviewer has said . instead they arrived double bagged and inside a usps cardboard envelope ( not a box ) which had torn a bit . no packing material , no packing slip . i'll find another supplier for the next batch . live and learn .

what a shock ! claxton fruitcake has been a family tradition since i was a child . . . so after several fruitcakeless years spent in south america i made a bee line to the nearest grocery and to my delight found stacks and stacks of claxton . the mere number in the store should have been a clue , but i didn't see it that way . noooo . . . lots and lots of that delicious fruitcake was my take . well , the moment i bit into the first slice i was disappointed . the pecan stuffed fruitcakes of my youth had been replaced by a tasteless almond filled concotion . i did find a suitable substitute at costco that far out shined the claxton of my rose colored memories . in three words , " don't buy it . " at least not until they replace the pecans . 
=================
unsatisfying - * unless * heated edited - these cookies are quite good ! but * only * if you microwave them . i put them in usually about 30 secs , butyou just have to do it till you can tell its softened . if you dont heat it , then you can't taste the chocolate chips at all and as a result is really unsatisfying . although , in my opinion w a really good snack you shouldnt have to do anything to it . but , w . e . in conclusion - these r realli good and youll get your $ worth , subscribe its only like $ 2 . 30 for each 7 oz packet . but , dont eat these unless you have a microwave at hand , or it really isnt good otherwise . 
=================
cats stopped eating it pretty quickly i like weruva's other flavors , as do my cats , but the outback grill variety has a lot of gelatinous filling that the cats don't like to eat . i end up having to throw out quite a bit of it because they only eat the chunks of fish . 
=================
big bag ! the package was even larger than i expected ! the bag is roughly 1'x1 . 5'x0 . 5' and contained at least 20 10 - inch rawhide rolls . it has a printed expiration date on the bag ( 2 years from the time i purchased them , which is far more than adequate for my heavy chewer ) . according to the information printed on the product , the rolls are 100 % beefhide and made in paraguay . so far my 3 year old 25lb terrier mix is crazy about them . she can go through one roll in a few hours , but i usually let her have half of one every few days . 
=================
delicious but won't buy again because of country of origin very tasty bars of wholesome ingredients . . . at least that's what's on the label . the bars do taste great and i'd buy them regularly except that the bars are made in china . it's sad the manufacturer has decided to save a buck by selling out us workers and exporting our food production . i won't buy them again until the country of origin states " us . "

gluten free , vegan , 0 net carbs ! mmmmm . . . . just got these today and decided to write this review . this is actually my first review on amazon ever ! i found out about these crackers a few weeks ago , and have been calling all over to find them locally , but to no avail . luckily , they are available on amazon ! if you like flax , you will like these . they have some patented process that keeps the flax whole , but makes it thin and crisp , so you grind them up in your mouth when you chew ( flax eaters know that a whole , raw flax seed likely won't get broken apart when you chew it , and then you don't end up getting all the good stuff in flax ! ) . the flavor on these is very slight , with only bragg's liquid aminos and lemon juice on the ingredient list ( besides flax ) . bragg's liquid aminos is a great product , pretty much soy sauce with no gluten ( it's 100 % fermented soy , so in a sense , it really is a true soy sauce and has a similar flavor to all the soy sauces on the market ) , and i use it in place of soy sauce for lots of things , so that's another great product to check out , as well . the lemon juice isn't apparent , and doesn't taste lemony in the least . these crackers are gluten free and vegan , and are a good match for those on specialty diets . also , with just 3 ingredients , they could probably be easily incorporated into rotation diets as well . i tried one plain right out of the pouch , and they are slightly salty ( from the bragg's ) . their texture reminds me of pumpkin seeds with the shell on . after sampling it plain , i put peanut butter on one , and the slight savory underpinnings of the cracker and the peanut butter go very well together . i'm looking forward to eating these with all sorts of things , and am very pleased i bought them , even though i had no idea what i was in for with a case of healthfood i'd never tried . flax is great for many things healthwise , and it is also unique in that it has 0 net carbs . that's right , all the carbs in there are 100 % dietary fiber . low - carbers should do a web search for the " one minute muffin " made with flax meal in the microwave . . . . they're really good and totally versatile , and really do make a low carb bread or muffin . the only issue i have with these is a little tiny warning on the bottom saying they use 99 . 99 % clean flax , but sometimes a little stone may be in there . i'm not overly concerned with this , and have had 5 crackers with no issue ( will post back when , if at all , i encounter one , and how many bags it took me to find it . . . . would be interested to hear from others how big a danger this really is . . . . ) , though a friend decided not to eat one based on this as she had recently had crown work , so just be aware that there is a remote possibility ! they have several other flavors , and i may try them one day , but i'm really pleased with these and so glad i found them ! update : i have consumed the entire case ( 6 bags ) and did not find any pebbles or rocks . i did find a few ( 3 or 4 in the whole case , so not even one in every bag ) very hard seeds ( they were definitely flax seeds ) that were not chewable and did feel like biting down on piece of something rock - like . all of these hard seeds were very dark , nearly black in color ( burned ? under - ripe ? not shelled ? ) , though not every dark seed was one of these hard seeds . i don't think that this is a reason to not consume these , but did want to offer an honest assessment of the " safety " of the product , esp . for individuals who have weak teeth . 
=================
not full - size cans ! i couldn't believe the tiny cans that came today . i've never seen these anywhere that chunky soup is sold . they look like kids' portions . go to walmart .

=================
a brand known worldwide ? this is a brand of orange pekoe black tea that is drunk all over the world . lipton sells it in many countries , and while the product might have the same smooth , almost inoffensive base note , to me the uk version tastes very different than the indian version , which is perceptable stronger and has a more " citrusy " note . while it doesn't hold up to some premium orange pekoe teas , it is distinctly better than the lipton tea available in us supermarkets . 
=================
you gotta be kidding ? i have lived in south louisiana for the past thirty years and am currently working in northeast pennsylvania . and though i can make my own roux i have reached the stage where i have no problem with faster shortcuts . but the price on this product is well out of line . i expect everyone to make some money but a 1000 % price markup is a little much . try zatarain's new orleans style gumbo base . it is available from amazon and almost as good .

my cats all love it ( but . . . . . ) i normally pick up the rc special 33 formula at my local pet food supply chain . however , prices keep creeping up and now they want $ 29 ( before tax ) for a 7 pound bag . so this month , i ordered royal canin via amazon , and also grabbed a bag of rc indoor 27 . i am saving $ 8 or $ 9 on each bag and it's being delivered to my front door ! all my cats gobble up the special 33 ( higher fat content than indoor 27 ) , originally intended for my vomit - breakfast cat , sage . generally , sage does not toss her cookies after eating special 33 . but it always helps to give her halo wet food first to settle her tummy and then the kibble . however , there was a different problem with my special 33 dry food order . the first night , the cats didn't seem interested it in and left a lot on their plates . odd . the next morning it was gone so they eventually ate it . next night , i happened to be in the kitchen under bright lights when i noticed the kibble looked shiny and wet . i scooped up some in my hand and it was literally oil soaked . somehow this particular batch had gone wrong . rc headquarters in missouri told me it was probably due to how the food was stored or shipped ( very hot or very cold temperatures ) that made the injected oils seep out . who knows . i'm thinking perhaps it stayed too long under the appetite enhancer spray machine at the factory ( they do that , you know ) . i threw it out and amazon happily and easily shipped me another bag . keeping fingers crossed that this bag of special 33 will be just fine . update may 2012 : after buying several bags of special 33 royal canin and verifying they were fine when i first opened them , after a day or two , the dry food again became slick and overly moist . i have determined that the food is just fine but it is altered by exposure to air somehow . my kitchen is not too warm nor too cold so i don't understand why the formula changes . one of the ingredients must pull in moisture , sort of like the latest and most expensive women's anti - aging creams that hydrate . 
=================
cat loves better then vet prescription food very early this year ( 2010 ) my vet diagnosed my cat with a urinary tract infection and gave her royal canin urinary so canned food . she liked it somewhat and seemed to get better . when the vet said that she would have to come back for another office visit i decided to try the purina urinary tract equivalent . my cat just loves it ! when hungry , she finishes off a 3 ounce can in about 15 minutes . i still give her the vet food as well but she never finishes off that food as a fast . she also eats the purina dry food , that i leave out , but not nearly as fast . unfortunately she is sick again ( weight loss - but not hypothyroid ) . blood work has not determined what is wrong with her . he wants another $ 500 for xrays and other stuff . she nearly 17 years old , so i'm not sure what i'll do .

yummmmmmm editing this review because there just isn't any taste in these things so i have ate maybe 2 or 3 packs of the caseits a boring snack to be honest
=================
taste is perfectly fine , don't know about the ph thing this water has a nice taste and the bottle is nice and sturdy to hold . what else to say about this water ? oh yes , the ph . i did not feel any different after drinking this water than i do after drinking any other water . it did absolutely nothing to even try to blow my socks off , and the asking price is too high for it to be so mediocre . this water didn't come from some rare source so the price tag is unwarranted . so why the 4 stars ? because it tastes like good water , as it's supposed to . if it were sold for the same price as sam's club water then i'd buy it . also , i think i'll stick to gatorade as opposed to expensive filtered tap water when i need electrolytes . 
=================
tea totaller we enjoy our keurig for coffee but tea leaves ( sorry ) a bit to be desired . somehow the taste provided by the steeping process outweighs the expensive convenience of the k - cups . for those of a like mind , we would suggest the following . buy your tea loose . you will probably save money , can control the quantity per serving and will end up with better quality . loose tea is available from amazon . purchase a adagio teas ingenuitea teapot thru amazon . efficient and brews a good 16 oz . cup of tea . for a few dollars more they have a 32 oz . add a bit of tea to the teapot , place the teapot on your keurig and fill with hot water . wait the appropriate steeping time and your tea is ready . for those who would like a warmed cup to pour into . fill the cup with a bit of hot water from the keurig and let it warm while the tea steeps .

where's the head ? you reckon when the ad says " whole rabbit " you ought get the whole rabbit . i ain't got a head on this critter ! my neighbor kids sure love playin with them rabbit heads . if i ain't got a rabbit head fer makin peace with them neighbor kids they prolly gonna come bust up my old ridin tractor . without my tractor i can't even get up the corner store for no beer . another thing is i ain't even got any intestines fer sausage makin ! how is easter dinner gonna be any good with no varmint sausages ? this thing looks like it coulda been a guinea pig or a chinchilla or somethin . i mean , it tasted pretty damn good with hot sauce , but i reckon i oughta shot my own critter next time around . that or scrape one up off the main road , sure is cheaper . least they left some bones in there for my ol coonhound to chaw awhile . mavis gives it four stars but i'm only givin it two on account of no head or nothin to make sausages with . reckon also if you ain't familiar with rabbit don't be expectin to feed no three grown men on one , ain't enough eatin on em .

the most taste - less earl grey ever i love drinking tea , and earl grey has been my choice everywhere i go . i enjoyed brewing tea from tea leaves , a habit that i have given up for the ease of tea bags . twinings tea had always been my pick until this last purchase from amazon . earl grey totally lost its poignancy . even two bags of tea could not brew a decent cup of tea . at first i thought it was the recent degradation of earl grey tea as a result of climate change etc . then i tasted other brand's earl grey and found acceptable . i went to the length and bought another pack of twining earl grey tea from a grocery store , and i tasted alright . so i can only conclude the tastelessness of twinings earl grey is associated with packages i bought from amazon . i found this to be true with amazon's darjeeling tea as well .

not as good as it sounds . . . kraft pure honey . sounds wonderful and " oh - so - wholesome " , right ? well maybe , but there is a problem . when this product arrived i learned that it was a product of the usa , brazil , and vietnam . there are two problems with that . the first is that us honey producers are struggling to survive , and cannot hope to compete with the price of honey produced in the third world . why do we care ? because they are vital to our survival , and our ability to produce food . we need to make a concerted effort to patronize us honey . the second concern is that many pesticides banned here in the us are still used in places like vietnam and brazil . ( and the ones still in use here are bad enough ! ) because of the nature of bees and the production of honey , it seems inevitable that some contamination is likely to occur . for that reason , i am not terribly thrilled with the idea of consuming honey originating anywhere other than the us , canada , or europe . other than the above concerns , the honey is well packaged , and visually attractive . but i am now looking for a source of honey packets containing only honey sourced in the us .

smaller than expected these are much smaller than i expected . i had purchased some pine nuts at a whole food store , and each nut was almost twice the size of these . these are also a little darker in color , but i don't know if that is significant . perhaps these have been " toasted " ( although there is no reference to that on the packaging ) .

pricey stuff and hardens up real fast ! i thought i would try this stuff for my finicky dog who needs moist food along with his kibble . he was not a big fan of it and it was the most expensive moist food at petsmart . the other problem is this stuff hardens up like concrete in his bowl . if he wouldn't eat the food in about two hours the stuff turned as hard as a sidewalk and i had to literally scrape it out of his bowl . 
=================
had problems - - - the taste is very good . problems i had were that this was european product soi had to figure how to convert to cups and ounces . although i like the taste andconvenience , i will not purchase again because of expensive s & h . i will lookfor this product locally unless it's offered by amazon on super saver .

it's water . . . it tastes wet essentia 9 . 5 ph drinking water , 1 . 5 liter , ( pack of 12 ) i cannot say that the claimed health benefits of this water are true . in order to prove or disprove that , i would have to hire a team of scientists and do expensive and exhaustive tests on myself . i'm not going to do that ! what i can tell you is that i have well water and it is extremely high in iron and has to have a softener added to make the water palatable . my problem with that is that i'm on a low salt diet for a heart condition so i now have to double filter my drinking water . it's filtered once at the beginning of the well and again in a separate filter in my fridge . this is some of the info from the essentia web site , and the product description from here - " drinking essentia water helps bring you back into balance and helps maintain normal blood pressure , restful sleep , heart health , muscle strength and more . plus , essentia water boosts the antioxidant properties of your immune system . " i have to admit that i did drink a whole bottle of this for the last few days - - - and i have been sleeping better ( can't tell you if it's a coincidence ) . if the claims of lowering blood pressure and heart health are true that will be a plus for me , but right now as i said only long - term usage and the help of my doctor will tell me if the claims are true . it tastes better than my well water and actually , it does have a ` smooth' sort of taste to it . of course , since it's bottled it is convenient to tote around and to keep some in my car too . the problem is , is that i'm not so sure if it is worth $ 2 . 40 a bottle without the subscription with the subscription it comes to $ 2 . 04 a bottle . if you drink the amount of water doctors recommend , that will come to approximately 300 . 00 a month ( much more if you want to use this water to make your coffee tea etc . for added health benefits ) . in addition , having to haul a heavy case of water up the stairs a few times a month does not turn me on .

pretty bad , and i drink coconut water daily , have tried many brands ! i adore coconut water . have since i was a kid . have had it out of the shell ( we are caribbean folks ) , chilled , and from assorted canned and bottled types , with and without sugar . i've tried a host . some brands i did not wish to revisit - - vitacoco is funky tasting to me . new zico ( bottle ) sucks . old zico ( tetrapak ) used to be nice , but after an intolerable and underhanded experience with their marketers online , i refuse to buy them anymore . o . n . e . is fine , and my sister loves it . i've had harvest bay , amy and brian , nature factor , and some names i forgt . i prefer taste nirvana these days , when i can't get the fresh ( ie , froms hell ) or raw organic one that whole foods sometimes stocks . this was not good . naked . ugh . i was out and about , thirsty , and stopped into a nutrition s'mart to buy coconut water . this was the only brand they had that i hadn't tried , so i went for it . ugh . never again . i cannot recommend this to coconut water lovers . but , hey , i like to at least try other brands . you never know which one will rock your world . and , as they say , different strokes . you may like this brand . but you might wanna give taste nirvana , amy and brian , o . n . e . and some others a shot first , ya know ? : dhappy gulping !

unsafe - choking hazard - try veggiedent chews instead our vet recommended getting " c . e . t . chews " to help clean our dog's teeth , so i looked around online and came across the veggiedent chews and the hextra premium chews . both of these met the requirement of being " c . e . t chews " but they looked ( and sounded from the description ) very different from each other , so i wasn't sure what kind to buy . based on the reviews for each , it still wasn't clear what would work better , so i ordered one pack of each . i was worried that the veggiedent chews would too easily be consumed and therefore wouldn't do much for cleaning her teeth , and i was worried that the hextra chews would be a choking hazard because they wouldn't come apart easily enough and she might swallow them whole . the veggiedent chews were definitely easy for her to break pieces off of , but she was quite happy doing so , and it took her about 15s or maybe a bit more to eat it . she chewed each little piece that broke off while she ate it , and it was definitely cleaning her teeth . the hextra chews , however , are a choking hazard , and i will never give her another one . she was very excited to get the hextra chew ( they smell terrible but apparently good to a dog ) and chewed on it for a second or two , and then in one quick gulp it was gone . the whole chew , still in one piece . it was in her mouth for about 2 seconds . she is a very strong chewer ( she can take chunks off of a black kong easily in 30 seconds or so , and she's a medium - large dog ) , and had no desire to chew pieces off of the hextra chew , i'm guessing because the moistened chew seemed like something to be swallowed whole . the hextra chews were useless for cleaning her teeth and a choking hazard , and i would never give her another one . in summary , the veggiedent chews were great for cleaning our dog's teeth ( though they didn't last particularly long , but if you're looking for something to last long , try a kong product ) , while the hextra chews did nothing for our dog's teeth and were also a choking hazard because she swallowed it whole within a second or two . note : i've posted this review for the veggiedent chews as well , in case it's useful for people who may be debating between these two types of c . e . t . chews .

packaging really bad i was very disappointed when my milk arrived , soaking wet because the pkg was not securely packed and one of the boxes of milk broke open and was all over the other boxes and packing box also . i have ordered this before and it came in perfect condition , because it was packed solid in a double box . so i was short one box of milk because it spilled everywhere inside . thanks , lynnette

sugar added it's a sweet sugar added beverage ( so of course it's sweet . you could add sugar to any other coco water and make it taste 'better' ) . tried it on sale but wouldn't buy it again . 1 . taste nirvana or c2o2 . vita coco3 . one or zico ( it's from concentrate - but the chocolate is a great post long run drink and delicious ! )

paid way too much ! no troubles with the product . i had used it before and could not find it locally . . . . so . . . . ordered it here . well now that is is stocked locally for pennies over $ 8 . 00 , i realized i paid twice that to get it on line . feel ripped off for sure . . . . .

sorry , i cannot recommend this dog food . this dogfood is like candy to the dogs , they love it , but it is not necessarily safe or healthy . the soy protien in this food gives them horrible gas . it's not just irritating for the owner , ( i mean i have my dog on my lap all the time ) but serious can be detrimental to your dogs health gas . yes , they will gobble it up and beg for more , but i decided it was not good for my two small dogs . as many other reviewers have already renumerated in more detail the reasons why this is just not good , i won't say more . but i am very picky about what i give my dogs . they are part of my family , and if there is a hint of doubt i won't give it to them . the gas thing cannot be good . purina is a reputable company , so use your own judgement , this is just my opinion .

took a long time - - not for caramel sauce first of all , i bought these with prejudice . i'd recently purchased starbucks sauce and syrup and they included the pumps at no additional cost . i got spoiled . so i didn't think to order pumps when i bought ghiradelli and torani sauces through amazon . after reading reviews and looking at prices , i bought these . disappointed . got a workout pumping the torani pumpkin pie sauce . but eventually it came out . broke a sweat pumping the ghiradelli caramel sauce so i left it alone for a while . thought the problem could be because the stem is too long . so , i cleared away the caramel and trimmed off 3 / 8 " . pumped some more for about two minutes and got a weak cough from the spout . i thought to myself , " it won't be long now . " except now , the pump doesn't even rise . got annoyed and started writing this scathing 1 - star review . looked over and saw the pump came back up and gave it another go . voila , caramel sauce . changed the review to three stars for making me have to work - - oh , and for the packaging or lack of ; i'd expect them to be individually cellophane sealed instead of open in an envelope . * edit 02 / 03 / 12knocked it down to 2 - stars . like another reviewer wrote it's not good for thick sauces , it definitely isn't . the stem and spout are just too narrow . i have to apply great pressure , put my body in it , to pump the caramel sauce . too much work getting my morning coffee . i will spend more for the right pump .

super yummy if you like hershey kisses and coconut then what could be better . the inside of the kiss is filled with a creamy slightly crunchy coconut creme . takes lots of control to stop eating them once you start . my favorite were the caramel kisses up until now . these are just super yummy ! ! ! update to the above review ; it's been over two weeks since purchasing these kisses . i went back to order more and to my shock the price has more then doubled . i am so upset because i promised to buy some for friends . i really am amazed at such a great increase in price . amazon is my all time favorite online store but such a change in price is just wrong . a google search is turning up much better prices for these hershey treats . i hate going elsewhere but what's fair is fair . this is plain wrong

interesting product , but not highly recommended the black salt seems a little bit mouisture . when you are seasoning in you dish or pan , the black colour may spread over . " although not as popular as the traditional red alaea salt , hawaiian black sea salt , or lava salt , is a dramatic , glossy black sea salt . the unique color comes from lava , which adds minerals and activated charcoal which results in a sulfuric aroma and earthy flavor . hawaiian black sea salt is used both as a finishing salt and a roasting salt . it is often used as a coating on fish to help preserve both flavor and moisture as it bakes . suggested uses : delicious on all types of seafoods , especially shellfish such as clams , mussels or scallops .

i suspect i got lucky i got a very nice assortment , but i suppose that may attributable to luck considering all the other negative reviews . i purchased two variety packs the other being crazy cups travel the world sampler , k - cup portion pack for keurig k - cup brewers ( pack of 35 ) and the variety of that one was awful , providing more evidence your selection will come down to luck . i will say that three of the k - cups didn't seem to have the seal pressure of the others , leading me to believe that the may have been punctured . this is concerning in itself and certainly could affect the freshness . all in all , i would suggest that if you are picking this sampler because of specific coffees listed , don't ; you'll likely be disappointed . if you just want to try some different k - cups go for it .

blue buffalo wilderness cat food i felt that my 13 yr . old siamese ( lester ) with a sensitive stomach , sometimes overeating and throw - up problem would benefit from a new " grain free " kibble . after doing some research , i choose blue buffalo wilderness over the evo that i had been feeding for a few months ( the evo had major dust and i had to sift it before feeding . . maybe 15 - 20 % by volume ) . towards the end of the second bbw bag i noticed that lester ( and my other cat ) were not eating their normal amount and their litter box wasn't as full . lester then was not cleaning up well after a # 2 , then in a couple of days stopped eating everything ( even his daily wet food snack ) , we took him to a vet ; blood work good , but x - rays show that he had large air bubbles in his stomach and upper gi . he couldn't eat anything without throwing it up . . nothing . the vet made no suggestions other than keep trying to feed him ; and it was only after going to petco and talking with their staff did we take action with a syringe , baby food ( beef ) , electrolyte , and a high protein cat paste all slurred and injected every hour that we got him recovering after a few days . i can not be sure it was the bbw cat food that deteriorated lester's health to very close to euthanizing , but i had not changed his wet food only his free choice kibble to hill's age defying and he is back to normal now . the hills has grain , but the kibbles are smaller and easier to digest and i am suspisious of blue buffalo wilderness and / or maybe that an older cat's system can not handle very high protein dry kibbles . he was ok on evo so makes me think that bbw was the problem .

not the real deal ! these tomatoes are domestically grown in ca . to the person who said that they didn't know how anyone can tell where they're from , read the product description written by the manufacturer . it says " these are domestically grown tomatoes . . . " , it also says " grown in california " right on the label . to the person who said he had tasted them , and referred to another reviewers comments and said that person had not tasted them , please reread the review . he clearly states that he had tasted them . as for me , i have cooked with these many times , because they were on sale at my local safeway . they are definitely not the real deal ! they do not look like , nor taste like real san marzano tomatoes grown in italy - which i have tasted and cooked with many times . they taste like any other run of the mill american grocery store brand . i agree with the 1st reviewer that their labels are false advertising , and the price they charge on amazon is highway robbery ! $ 4 . 50 + shipping - ouch ! i paid about $ 1 per 28 oz . can ( on sale ) at my local market . save your time and money - if you are looking for the real deal , this is not it . there are websites that sell nothing but real italian products , grown in italy , and stamped with the official italian dop seal . nancy

yeah , that was unfortunate . don't think the previous reviewer is wrong , jaded , or somehow a veggie jerky competitor . these things really are rubbish . what's worse ? this good deal through amazon means you'll have plenty of these meat flavored sponges to impress your friends with how bad it can get . i will say that my friends and i found that if you leave them out to dry for about 48 hours , they do get a little better in the texture department . but to quote one friend , " well , that made them easier to spit out .

delivers flavor - not wimpy like some i like flavored coffee that really delivers the flavor . with some flavored coffee you just taste a hint of the flavor . not this one - you can really taste the vanilla and hazelnut . i read a review here from someone who did not like the coffee because they found the flavor to be overpowering , and so i ordered it and i love it .

a poser at best we all know that swiss cake rolls will never achieve the delicious status enjoyed by yodels , but i really do give them an a for effort . the major complaint with these snacks is that they are just too dry . they attempt to surround creme filling with some kind of chocolate cake , but the result comes off as a cheap tasting joke . i don't really have any advice for little debbie to improve this product , though . they should simply leave it up to the experts at drake's snack foods .

bad tasting bars i still haven't figured out what i'm going to do with the 3 - pack that i bought from amazon . i tasted one bar and completed it with great difficulty . i am a regular breakfast bar eater and bought this expecting meal bars to keep hunger away fro longer than breakfast bars do . i love strawberries too yet i say these taste terrible !

tasty treats - questionable source treats smell so good i would like to eat them myself . they are manufactured in china and they look shiny on the outside and i am not sure how that happens to the chicken and the company has not responded to my questions about this . i have concerns because of china's reputation , plus they eat dogs in china , so how concerned could they be with making a clean expensive dog treat for rich americans !

break the cycle of overpriced single serve cups of coffee once and for all ! ! just because these come in a tea bag type of pouch does not mean they can not be brewed in a single cup ( $ 20 ) coffee pot . i tried this method of brewing single cups of coffee out of disgust with the price of the all - mighty k cups pods . with k cups , i found myself spiraling toward financial ruin simply to enjoy coffee in a single serving cup . so , for a fraction of the cost here is what i recommend . purchase a $ 20 single serve coffee maker , doesn't matter the brand but this is the exact one i use with the metal permanent filter removed single serve coffee maker . . . get the cheapest one you can find . all it is doing is heating water - keep that in mind . put one of these tea bag style pouches in the filter compartment . push it down really good in the filter holder and make sure the water won't flow around it as it hits the bag . sit back and wait , soon you will have a perfect cup of folgers coffee . i have not brewed a pot of coffee any other way since going to these . i have purchased hundreds of packets and have never been disappointed . i just hope folgers doesn't realize what they have here and jack up the price . so . . . cut yourself loose from the k cup cycle and with the cash you save treat yourself by purchasing one of the out - of - service space shuttles , or send an entire class of graduates at your local school to harvard .

i wish my toddler liked it i really wish my toddler liked this . it seems to be very high quality and it would provide more variety in his diet . every so often he'll eat it , but it usually needs to be mixed with something else . i think it tastes fine , but it wasn't a hit . i bought a case so i keep trying .

eh its okay i was excited to try these out . it's not like the marshmallows you get in the cereal . rather its more like the tiny marshmallows you get in those packets of hot chocolate . i tried it with my cereal and you know what it's definitely doable . that's why i rated it 4 stars . i'm sure other can find more applications for it . just beware that 12oz is a lot ! sadly i couldn't finish my marshmallows and i left them near a window with direct sunlight . not a good idea . they will get sticky and icky ( not the good kind either ) . try them out if you like mini marshmallows this will not disappoint , kind of .

fiber : 1 , farts : 20 this product is known to give people gas . i actually counted over a period of several days and each bar caused me to fart 18 - 22 times from four to six hours after i ate it . if you live alone or are on cipro for athrax exposure and your intestines are sterile , maybe you can live with that side effect . otherwise , it's better to give to someone as a joke than to eat yourself . other than that , it tastes pretty good if not too sweet . additional comments 17 months after my above review : first , let me state on their box general mills had plenty of room to educate about different fiber sources while promoting the variety of fiber products they produce . i had a chance to try target's generic competitor to this food product and found the same stinkin' results . using wikipedia ( yes a printed dictionary would be more reliable ) i see that the main ingredient of these products , called " chicory root extract " , is full of an indigestible sugar called inulin that ferments into gas in your large intestine . inulin is no doubt responsible for the too - sweet taste of the bars that i mentioned in my first review 17 months ago . another vegetable containing inulin is the jerusalem artichoke for which wikipedia has the following snippet : gerard's herbal , printed in 1621 , quotes the english planter john goodyer on jerusalem artichokes : " which way soever they be dressed and eaten , they stir and cause a filthy loathsome stinkingwind within the body , thereby causing the belly to be pained and tormented , and are a meat morefit for swine than men . " ergo i conclude fiber one bars are more fit for swine than men . if people knew that in year 1621 , why is general mills putting out an inulin - filled product now ? and why in all their biased , pro - fiber packaging is there not a single mention of the gastrointestinal side effects known to effect a large swath of the population for almost 400 years ? corporate food scientists don't just throw random boxes from the undesirable vegetable dispensary into a stew , and somehow get instant fda approval and national distribution channels , folks .

hard to give a clear review and i say that because this product isn't designed for my hair . my father is caucasian , my mother is vietnamese . i have a lot of hair . i wouldn't call it oily , but in the summer it can look that way if left to it's own devices . my hair is a little longer than shoulder length and i have rather heavy bangs . in the virginia summer , my ends can frizz . and i dislike it , so when i was given this to try , i thought it would be right up my alley . as others have mentioned , there are no directions on the jar , but i gave it a shot . let me say this . . . it smells wonderful ! and i thought i would use it like a leave in hair treatment . since it is so thick ( someone else said almost like shortening , and i would agree with that ! ) i used just a bit and coated my hair with it . my hair felt nice as it was drying , but a few hours later it felt heavy , and rather greasy . i didn't like the way it felt , and i jumped in the shower again to wash it out . the more i looked at it the more i began to think this is not for women with my hair type . while looking online i did indeed find the product , and it is marketed for african american women . i was very surprised to find that the main ingredient in this is petrolatum . the same stuff in ad ointment . why would you to put that on your hair ? as i stated , it is hard for me to give a proper review as it isn't made for my hair type , but i can't imagine anyone wanting to put ad ointment / vaseline on their hair .

sugar not hfcs finding a cola made with real sugar in my area is quite the challenge . anyone who thinks coke made with high fructose corn syrup is the same as coke made with sugar is kidding themselves . hfcs is a corn byproduct that is so refined and converted that even the food industry admits it isn't " natural " . i realize that soda isn't exactly a health food item , but i refuse to drink anything that has artificial ingredients such as hfcs or the poison known as " splenda " . the coca cola conglomerate isn't doing us consumers any favors by selling their poison . it's a shame we have to purchase this product from mexico .

as described but difficult to use i bought the kit to dabble in spherification . the item is as - described and arrived on time . my complaint is that the instructions measure the required chemicals in fractions of grams . my kitchen scale measures as low as 1 gram but does not do fractions of grams . i cannot find a kitchen scale that measures fractions of grams . therefore i find the kit difficult to use . i would not recommend the kit because it requires the purchase of specialized scale that can measure tenths of grams .

not as awesome as i'd expected i have friends who are raving fans of the mallomars . i figured they'd be a big hit with me too . after all , there aren't very many junk foods that i don't like . if anything , i have impulse controls issues and have trouble stopping at just one of anything . so i was really surprised when i tried my first mallomar yesterday . i expected to really have to restrain myself and avoid scarfing down a bunch of them . but no . one was enough . i had no desire to try another . i guess that's lucky for me , because at 60 calories each , these pack quite a payload . hmmm . maybe i was in a bad mood or there was a sampling issue . i can't honestly form an opinion on just one , so i tried another one a few hours later and then one more again today . i had the same feeling after every one of them : too much dark chocolate flavor . i like dark chocolate a lot , but these have a surprisingly long lasting dark chocolate aftertaste . the marshmallow inside is really first rate . marshmallows can get stale and funky pretty easily ( except for rock hard easter peeps ! ) . so yes , they really succeeded with the filling . the cookie was ok , but it didn't hold together very well . it tried to split vertically , which i expected , but it also delaminated horizontally and made a big mess . the cookie taste wasn't as good as i expected . it was fresh and buttery , but there was no sweet flavor or even any graham flavor . it was just a buttery shortbread taste ( and messy ) . and besides the dark chocolate aftertaste , my other lasting impression was that the three tastes ( chocolate , marshmallow , and cookie ) really didn't marry very well in this treat . they don't combine into a distinct taste like a s'more or a moon pie . they're just three individual tastes . or actually the marshmallow and the cookie are just delivery systems for the dark chocolate flavor . i've probably really made you mad by now if you're a mallomar fan . it's fine with me if you like them : different strokes . i wish i could share the rest of my box with you . but if you do like them , is amazon the right place to buy them ? my box of mallomars had a pretty rough ride . the chocolate was marred pretty badly and at least one of them was damaged . i don't think the packaging from nabisco is sufficient for shipping these by ups or fedex . i'm sure they do just fine on the regular truck to the grocery store , but freight shipping is a different experience . i'll post a link to a photo so you can see the condition of the contents . it's the cool autumn in southern california right now , so the contents weren't melted . they would have been badly damaged during the hotter months . so there you have it . it's a treat that a junk food junkie like me can turn his back on . and it's a shopping experience that will probably be disappointing to real fans of this treat . i recommend you pass this item up . check out the product photo that i posted . it shows the condition of the cookies when they arrived .

no pollen . . . according to foodsafetynews . com on 11 / 07 / 2011 ; 77 percent of the honey sampled from big box stores like costco , sam's club , walmart , target and h - e - b had the pollen filtered out . ultra filtering is a high - tech procedure where honey is heated , sometimes watered down and then forced at high pressure through extremely small filters to remove pollen , which is the only foolproof sign identifying the source of the honey . it is a spin - off of a technique refined by the chinese , who have illegally dumped tons of their honey - some containing illegal antibiotics - on the u . s . market for years . amazing what corporations do for profit . pollen is what i consume honey for . pollen is what helps my body as a medicine , a super food , antioxidants , etc . for my health . without pollen , i might as well consume sugar . fancy grade a , natural , pure and even raw are very misused words . these words are used to fool consumers just like it is done in every sector of the food industry . conventional honey simply does not even come close to organic since it has many unwanted ingredients like gm plants , pesticides , etc . which harm the environment , the honey bee and my health . i consume manuka as well as certified 100 % organic raw honey from reputable source . that way i get the pollens and the antioxidants in the honey like i am suppose to . you will be surprised what you will find in your neighbourhood organic stores . i purchased one container from costco but now i know better .

great idea , poor execution where , oh where can you find a tea strainer that doesn't leak ? these tuffy steepers are cute , look practical and easy to use , but they fail at their basic purpose . . . straining the tea and keeping leafs out of the brew . they collapse into easily transportable shapes , come with a little lid that serves as a base for the hot , wet strainer when finished , they're dishwasher safe . . . but they don't keep the loose tea out of the brew ! infuriating . plus , they're awful big and take up a lot of room in the cup , so when you remove the steeper , you're left with a 1 / 2 cup of tea . one other thing , there's a funky clip that you can see in the pictures . it's a small plastic thing that extends out over the steeper , for what purpose i can't tell . it might have been better designed where it repositioned to extend out and down , so you could clip it over the rim of the cup to steady the thing . i was disappointed by these . great looks , little function . my hunt continues .

 $ 17 . 69 but salted i am running out of the amore brand of anchovy paste that is not salted but amazon is out of stock on the brand . i enjoy crown prince sardines in olive oil so i am giving their anchovy paste a shot . these do not give as much depth of flavor as the amore brand so i am going back to the amore .

great - but price increase ? these bars recently went up almost $ 5 a box . unfortunately , this has led to me cancelling my subscription to these . they are one of my favorite snacks but the bar is pretty small and for the price it isn't worth it to me anymore . other than that it is a great product ! 
=================
shipping having ordered two of this item , they were shipped in one small box losely packed with only air pillows . one had leaked and the other had the seal broken . i ordered only one replacement , explaining how all the other jugs of maple syrup were packed to prevent damage . the replacement arrived undamaged , but again loosely packed in a small box with only air pillows . as there are other alternatives on amazon that are shipped properly and the seals are more substantial , i recommend ordering one of them .

food good , service not so much my cats love this food , but i would not choose to deal with pet food direct again . half of the cans in the 2 cases i bought , are dented and this company is useless to try to deal with . i will stick to the food that is sold by amazon only . who needs the hassle . 
=================
this is a first for me wow , i've never not liked one of the coffees or teas that are made for the keuring . . . at least until now . weak and flavorless and is the best i can say about this . you get neither a good tea taste nor a lemonade taste . you do seem to get a bit of a bitter after - taste though . this may be due to how much the ice cubes melt during production . frankly it is easier and less expensive to have a gallon of a good brand pre - made combination drink on hand . brewed on 8 ounce setting as per manufacturers recommendation . * sample provided by the manufacturer *

excellent ides tea horrible price love this iced tea . we go through at least 6 - 7 gallons a week in my house . with 4 people . but the price listed here is horrible ! ! ! ! ! i buy mine at the store . it cost $ 4 . 50 per cannister and i wait to stock up when they are buy 1 get 1 free . then i buy cases of it ! ! and for the person who gave a one star . they do not make plain iced tea .

absolutely gluten free crackers and flatbread absolutely gluten - free flat bread and crackers are both excellent products . i have now placed two orders of 5 boxes with amazon as the price is more than $ 2 less per box than in my local grocery store . unfortunately , on both occasions , the product has arrived in 85 % shattered condition . gluten free products are very unstable vs . wheat products . i would recommend the product highly , but i do not recommend getting them via mail order if shipping standards cannot be improved . edith streubert

a little different baja precious has a somewhat different flavor than the extra virgin olive oils to which i am accustomed . i would describe it as lacking the slight sweetness of my previous brands . without supporting evidence , my suspicion is that the difference is due to the absence of adulterants added to virtually all other brands , regardless of quality . too soon to evaluate in use , but whether it turns out better or worse , at least i received what i paid for - 100 % olive oil - for the first time , it seems .

used to work , does not any longer this was a godsend a few years back ; today , the dispenser fails in two ways : 1 ) the dispenser will fall apart one time in three2 ) the dispenser will not dispense properly : what used to last for 5 minutes of spray will now take 1 / 2 an hour for the the bottle to get to 1 / 2 empty , and try as you might , you'll never get the last 1 / 4 outnot only does it not dispense , it does not kill mosquitoes any longer , even if i use my ortho dial - n - spray to dispense it . why does it no longer kill mosquitoes ? because they changed the formula . it used to be 2 . 5 % permethrin ; today it's 0 . 16 % lambda - cyhalothrin ( brand name cyonara ) my father in law shares the same disappointment ; he loved it when i introduced him to it , but now he can no longer use his yard after a record rainfall in ny and a bumper crop of mosquitoes .

diabetes is a small price to pay sits in a bowl - all 5lbs of it - i walk by it every time i go down to the kitchen . it tempts me , but i say no ! only when i accomplish something will i abduct a single sugary morsel as a reward . to prolong the ecstasy , i nibble at it to nothingness . i'd like to imagine its bountiful siblings watching in sheer horror from their glass home as i do the deed . . . sometimes i take two . . .

ok to use 6 months after expiration not too acidic , not too bitter - very well balanced . have used wtih no problem at 6 months after expiration date on package . just seemed a little " clumpy " at that point but tasted fine . much better value per unit than smaller packaging . i ordered off the starbucks site directly at this price , didn't notice a short expiration so wonder if it is amazon fulfillment issue ? 
=================
the uneven caramel is done on purpose i purchased the caramel apple pops to share at my office . they are delicious . they look a little misshapen , but i realized after eating one that the uneven coating of caramel is so that you can get the caramel and the apple flavors at the same time . think about it . if the sucker were completely covered with caramel , you would not taste the apple candy until the caramel was gone . i don't recommend biting through both parts of the candy to get the 2 flavors . as it is , i must be careful about the caramel sticking to my teeth . the manufacturer's way of handling the dilemma looks messy , but is pure genius . 
=================
only recieved 4 packages of the product . i am not happy about this at all . the chai is great , but i only received 4 packages of oregon chai even though i paid for 6 . in addition , one of the 4 packages was punctured and leaked all over the others , leaving a sticky mess .

ugh ! horrible tasting coffee . worst french roast i've ever had . what am i gonna do with four pounds ( less a half dozen scoops ) of this stuff ? i was hoping to find a decent french roast that i could get at a reasonable price , and take advantage of the free amazon prime shipping . but who is jeremiah , and what exactly was he picking ? this was not the solution ! the beans in this coffee are visibly inconsistent in their roast . some beans appear almost raw , some are dark like good french roast should be , and most are mildly brown like a columbian . the beans also are small in comparison to all other coffees that i've tried , although i don't know what that signifies ; the appearance is like beans that never fully matured . i've avoided starbucks coffee - although its generally very good , they kind of burn the beans , plus its way overpriced to get the brand name . the best alternative i've found , and the one i'm going back to , is the barista brava french roast found online at the sam's club site . the beans are dark , plump , and consistent in quality , with a flavor at least as good as starbucks . it might be a little more expensive than jeremiah's pick once you throw in the shipping , but at least its palatable . 
=================
artificial taste , typical stimulent based energy drink this bottle of fruit punch flavored vitamin squeeze sat in my refrigerator for a while . i usually drink filtered water and i don't typically like to add anything to it . but the vitamin squeeze product seemed like a good thing to try , not only for the flavor it adds to water but for the small array of vitamins this product adds . when i finally got around to trying it , i wanted to judge it based on flavor and health benefits based on the ingredient list . for flavor , i did not really care for this product . the sucralose gives it that unmistakable artificial taste , and the first word that popped in my head when i tasted it was " fake . " it tastes cloyingly sweet and artificial , like those bottles of " healthy " fruit punch you see in the juice aisle . for the health benefits , i am always somewhat skeptical of any product that claims to increase " energy " yet contains no carbs or calories . and like most " energy " drinks , one of the ingredients is " natural caffeine " mixed with an assortment of b - vitamins and an amino acid . in my opinion , this product might increase your energy levels temporarily , but much of that effect comes from the stimulant properties of caffeine . the real test of a product like this is " would i drink it again . " and the answer for me is " no . " i found the taste very artificial and i don't like using sucralose - containing ( splenda ) products . ( i switched to truvia natural sweetener a long time ago ) . i am also sensitive to caffeine , and drinking any caffeine containing product after a certain time leaves me with insomnia . personally , i would prefer skipping this product and continuing to drink plain water , taking a vitamin supplement for the extra vitamins . so overall , i do not recommend this product . the only reason i upgraded from 1 star to 2 stars is the fact that this product does contain some beneficial vitamins , unlike most ready - made , highly sweetened fruit punch drinks .

good deal , good stuff ! we purchased this before from amazon and loved it , so we purchased it again ! everyone loves the original flavor ! the hot and spicy is a little hot for us , so since we use ground turkey that comes in a 2 . 5 pound container , we use one hot and spicy and one original . that makes the people who like the hot & spicy happy , but isn't too hot for us ! the teriyaki is a little bland , like many people pointed out . so , i throw a little extra liquid teriyaki in there to help it along . the garlic & cracked pepper is really good too ! ! we have a nesco dehydrator and put it on for 8 hours , using the round tip on the jerky gun . it comes out like a slim jim , but so much better for you - less fat , etc . . . yes , i know there are chemicals in this too . . . we also use the dehydrator for fruits and herbs . . . when we run out of this 24 pack , we will be reordering from amazon !

clogged up my keurig this stuff tastes great . however , it is not really coffee . it is a flavored drink on the order of hot cocoa . it has a lot of calories ( 80 per cup ) and sugar . it also clogged up my keurig big time .

bamboo for my feg shui betterdecor is an amazing sight . the people care about their products which are out standing . if you are looking for water bamboo this is the place . they ship quickly and keep the customer informed of the tracking number and arrival dates . the bamboo arrived and i put it in water there were instructions on the care . everything you could want .

really tastes better ! i've been trying to buy this off the shelf and just could not find it ( for , like , 2 years ) . i mainly wanted it for texture - - table salt is not fine enough . this stuff is so fine it completely changes the flavors . i wouldn't have believed it myself .

stupid me this juice is phenomenal - - it's not the product i have a problem with , but the price i just paid ( $ 35 . 76 for a case of 24 ) . spicy v8 is all i ever buy , but is extremely difficult to find in the 11 . 5 oz cans . i ordered this online thinking it would probably cost a little more , but imagine my surprise and chagrin when i found a case of 24 regular v8 , 11 . 5 oz cans , at costco yesterday ( 1 - 12 - 11 ) for $ 12 . 59 . just how much could spicing up the v8 cost the manufacturer ? my stupidity ( i rate myself a " minus one star " for consumerism ) , but paying triple the price is a bit much . i'm keeping the order , of course , because it was my mistake totally , but you can bet this won't happen again .

mi - del gluten - free royal vanilla sandwich cookies i was sceptical at first about a sandwich , gluten free cookie . boy was i wrong ! they taste great ! however , i had to stop eating them , i am allergic to potato ! what a bummer . i wanted a sandwich cookie and this fit the bill . i bought a case , took some cookies to work and everyone in the office loved them . ( i am the only one with celiac disease in the office ) so when i could no longer eat the cookies , the office ate all my cookies ! they wanted more . i directed them to amazon . com . the ladies in the office had no idea , gluten free cookies tasted so good . they have also eaten my chocolate chip , gingersnaps , shortbread cookies too . so these cookies appeal to everyone !

stopped working i used the thermometer about 7 or 8 times and it stopped working . i have seen several reviews complaining that the probe fails so i'm hoping that's the problem . update 2 / 27 / 08 : i ordered a new probe from brookstone for $ 25 ( incl . shipping ) and it is a much sturdier design than the original . i assume they were getting a lot of complaints and returns so they redesigned it . so far the new probe is working fine . interesting to note , i gave a negative review of this product on their web site and they never published it , although they sent me a thank you note for my review .

great product ! great price ! i don't usually write reviews but i feel i have to share this . first of all , i want to say that this is probably the best deal i've found yet for coconut oil . it smells and tastes wonderful and it arrived quickly ! next . . . i actually bought this to give to my mother , who is in the late stages of alzheimer's . recently , i've read quite a few articles that praise coconut oil for helping people with this affliction and decided to give it a try . my mom , who is now on hospice , spends most of her days sleeping . when she is awake , she's in a 'zombie - like' stage . she rarely speaks and doesn't recognize any of her family . she won't eat anymore . . . only drinks ensure . anyway , i brought this to her caregivers and asked them to start mixing it into her ensure and giving it to her 3x a day . after a week , i went to see her to see if there were any changes . all i can say is wow ! ! ! not only was she awake when i went to see her , she recognized me as soon as i entered the room . and here's the really cool part . while i was there visiting , a family member of another resident told me a joke and my mom starting cracking up ! ! i said , " wow , mom , you laughed . " to which she replied , " well , it was funny ! " i nearly cried ! i doubt she'll ever get back to her old self again but if this can help give her a better quality of life , i'll make sure she has a never - ending supply of this wonderful product . needless to say , i'll be ordering more ! 
=================
don't expect coffee flavor i know some other reviewers have raved about this product stating it is mild , and is the closest thing out there to real coffee . well , let me tell you if this is the closest thing we're all screwed . when i made it the smell was akin to someone who just had a cigarette and then came inside and sat down next to you . seriously , this stuff is pungent . and if you are a real coffee drinker who drinks it black to taste the flavor of the bean you will be disappointed . i understand this is a coffee substitute and realistically it's not going to taste exactly like coffee but this isn't even close . i promise i'm not an angry , bitter person just a coffee drinker who expected more . i did some research and found out about cold brewing which takes out approximately 70 % of the acidity in the coffee which helps a gerd sufferer such as myself . you can use your favorite coffee to do it too and it tastes great because it is actually coffee . i used 12oz of coffee mixed in with 6 cups of water in a pourer container . let sit for 24 hrs in fridge and then used a super fine strainer to keep out the grit and poured into a second container to hold the coffee concentrate in the fridge good for two weeks . i then used 1 . 5 ounces ( a shot glass to the top ) plus 6oz of hot water and it tasted exactly like my usual morning cup of coffee minus the heartburn and symptoms associated with gerd . they do make a french press called the bodum bean which i just ordered to simplify the whole process .

amazon michael season's thin & crispy unsalted potato chips - sad news the taste was very good on this product but i bought the 12 pkg plan and the bags each were anywhere from 1 / 3 to 1 / 2 crumbs or small pieces you would only use on top of a casserole . no dipping or presentation wise nothing . however since i need unsalted chips they were worth a try and i need to cancel future orders of this one and stay with the michael season's kettle ones which of course were more durable and they too taste the same as the others . amazon please note to cancel automatic shipping on this product but keep the one for the kettle chips - thanks
=================
so - so wish i could say i loved it , but it was so - so . i did use it , but just not quite enough taste as some of their other items . 
=================
beware i love chiclets . too bad the manufacturer may have blown it by using a new rubbery gum base that renders it almost impossible to chew after a couple of minutes . yet another fine product down the drain due to what is likely to be cost cutting . .

inferior product - - the most moist , delicious , & sustainably caught sardines are , by and far , the wild planet brand ! i tried both the " season " and " crown prince " brands and the difference in flavor and quality was light years away from the wild planet brand . i live in new england and can only find wild planet brand in my local stop and shop . it's amazing that we have 3 " whole foods " markets in my state and not one carries the wild planet brand ! they are only carry what i believe to be the inferior quality brands that i mentioned . i'm sure that the hoffman and manischewitz families that own crown prince and season brands wouldn't mind having the wild planet brand alongside their own , since they feel theirs are such great quality , right ? who knows , they just might learn something about having high standards from the lovely bunch of people that own wild planet in california . to top it off , all wild planet products are in bpa free cans . . . what more can you ask for ? 
=================
these really work ! i bought these for my 13 year old pug , who has very bad hips and arthritis , and very few teeth . poor ole girl , she's a sweetheart , but getting around was hard on her . these are soft , so she can chew them with no problem , and while she's still stiff if she's been sleeping a long time , she loosens right up once she starts moving . she was on metacam , which worked just about the same , but is waaaay more expensive . i love that these are made in the usa and part of the profits are donated to the dog and cat research fund . these are just a win - win - win all around for us ! almost for got to mention . . . . she loves them ! 
=================
crap - e diem i apologize to the makers of this drink for saying this , but it is just not good . at all . to be honest i think it tastes curiously like mouthwash . i can't really get past that and enjoy it . it's almost like mint tea that has waaaaay too much sugar in it or something . i am a huge fan of synergy / gt's kombucha , but i thought i'd try this because it's slightly cheaper . i have to say that the synergy is well worth the extra $ 12 per 12 bottle case ( i purchase the cases at whole foods for $ 35 ) . even if i could get past the minty mouthwash taste , i still have to question the health benefits of this brand of kombucha given the ingredients list . it reads : lightly carbonated water , sucrose , herbal tea blend , kombucha cultures , lactobacilli , acerola juice concentrate . you don't even get to kombucha until the fourth ingredient - and that comes after water and sugar ? ? one can drink seltzer water with sugar and " herbal tea " for much cheaper than $ 23 / 12 bottles . seriously . spend the extra few bucks and buy the synergy , whose ingredients are as follows ( this is for the " trilogy " flavor ) : 95 % gt's organic raw kombucha , raspberry juice , lemon juice , fresh pressed ginger juice , and 100 % pure love . bottom line , if you want mint soda , then by all means , seize the day . if you want real , raw kombucha with health benefits and a delicious taste , go for synergy / gt's kombucha . 
=================
decent gift , not great i bought this as a gift for a co - worker , and she told me her family enjoyed the cheese a lot . that said , i was disappointed with this as a gift , as the box was much smaller than i expected and the unattractive , very loose ribbon made a weak presentation . ( i couldn't re - tie the ribbon or even remove it , since it was attached with a sticker to the box and would have ended up tearing the box . ) overall , i won't be buying this as a gift again - better to find a great local cheese shop and wrap everything properly . 
=================
waaay to salty to enjoy . i tried really hard to like the product ( it comes in a case of 12 after all ) but i just could not take the taste . it looks like regular chili , has some fat like regular chili , has a texture like regular chili , and it almost tastes good , if you can get past the salt . this is the second , and last , of this brand and type of veggie product i will try . they rely too much on salt to compensate for the perceived lack of flavor from real meat . a much better , imho , veggie chili can be made with some diced onions , tomatoes , green bell peppers , a hot chile of your choice , garlic , oregano , chili powder , a little masa , tomato paste , and one or more types of beans , like pintos , kidneys , mayo coba , etc . just a pinch of salt and your done , or add your own meat or substitute if you have to . i hope there are some vegetarians at the food bank . edit : i'll add that many canned foods tend to be a little salty to me , so we don't eat too many of them . i will say that compared to other canned chilis i have tried , vegetarian or not , this compared favorably . but , i can't take salt out of a prepared food whereas others can always add salt . this was the deal breaker for me , as it is with other prepared , canned chilis . 
=================
sls - full i will never understand the soaps from mainstream , and sometimes otherwise great brands , who claim to have a line of " sensitive skin " products which still contain sodium lauryl or laureth ( as in this case ) sulfate . if you're someone who needs sensitive skin products there's a more than decent chance that you also need stuff without sls . boo . refer to their bar soap , which is wonderful . 
=================
i can't believe the price doubled ! since june 2011 , the price went from $ 15 for 6 cans to almost $ 30 for 6 . that is a terrible price jump . i love the oatmeal but not at that price . i will find another , cheaper , place to purchase . 
=================
too expensive ! ! ! short and sweet . . . very good coffee , but way too expensive here . . . try costco . . . 34 dollars same item , same count ! very upset the way amazon has raised all the prices on coffee . . i know beans have gone up . . . but a sale once in a while couldn't hurt . costco . . 34 $ dollars for the same 80 ct . somebody is overcharging us consumers tony
=================
not so cluster - y the quality is good but its more like eating seeds than clusters . there is no way you can just grab a handful and go . you have to have them as a topper on yogurt or oatmeal . this product would rock if it was in clusters . i will not be purchasing it again because of this reason
=================
i love kind bars , but this flavor only ok let me preface this review by saying that i love kind bars . i love their all - natural ingredients , use of non - gmo products , and marginal amount of sugar per bar . this " dark chocolate nuts & sea salt " flavor sounded intriguing , but i was ultimately disappointed by the subtle flavors . the dark chocolate is a very light touch and i could barely taste the sea salt . the nuts are plentiful on the other hand , but a little too hard and gummy and they usually got stuck in my teeth . they did make a tasty snack with greek yogurt however , which helped to soften the nuts . 
=================
bring back the original formula ! ! ! ! honestly i am so upset with special k for changing the formula of this cereal . i loved the old 100 - calorie for 3 / 4 cup , 12g protein version - - it was higher fiber and lower sugar . what's the point in making a cereal like this for low - carbers if you're going to increase the net carbs ? bring back the original ! 
=================
not the best can of rice and beans , but certainly the least toxic . it is kind of spicy , which is nice , because otherwise it would be very bland . i got the eden black beans as well , and they are a lot worse without the caribbean rice . of course , the best feature of these products is the bean cans do not have bpa toxicity , as well as no toxic ingredients or sweeteners . no salt even ! if you want the rawest , natural , bare beans and rice . here it is . hopefully you can season and flavor foods if there's not enough oomph in them , or you know someone that can .

not what i expected i got a box of assorted skittles and starburst . the picture showed a mixture of starburst , skittles , m & ms , and 3 musketeers . 
=================
wrong ingredients list don't buy this food if you are looking for the primary ingredient to be meat . the ingredients list on the product page on amazon says " chicken , turkey , chicken meal , ocean fish meal " before any grains are listed . this is wrong . the package as well as chicken soup website list it this way " whole grain brown rice , chicken , turkey , chicken meal , turkey meal " while it's possible that it may still contain enough meat , i still don't trust that it does . any dog food you buy should contain 1 or 2 ( meat ) meal ingredients before any grains are listed . if it doesn't say " meal " after the meat , it means the meat weight was measured before the meat was dehydrated . if it says " meal " after the meat , the weight was measured after the meat was dehydrated . therefore , " meals " constitute more meat in the product composition than meats listed without meal after them . from the ingredients list on amazon for this product , i expected the meats included were less fatty , hence the " light " description . this is not entirely the case . they have reduced the meat and upped the grain in this formula . either get the regular version of the chicken soup food or consider another food . for more info on dog foods , google " dog food analysis " . some good budget friendly alternatives that are better and cheaper than this product are the diamond naturals dog foods . amazon carries these foods as well . search for " diamond naturals ( meat here ) and rice " they have chicken , lamb , and beef varieties . also , diamond naturals makes the chicken soup line of foods , but they are typically cheaper . just some food for thought . 
=================
i used to love this gum . i remember when stride first came out . i was amazing how long the flavor lasted ! with this new 2 . 0 stride sweet peppermint , it just doesn't last as long . i like the foil wrapper ( they don't " sweat " like the old ones ) . the flavor and consistency are great too . however , the flavor just doesn't last like it used to . so overall this is a step in the wrong direction . 
=================
nice tins i emptied the contents of the tins and used them for other tea . the tea seems to give me bad gas . i think the product could be old , but the date suggets it is still good . as for the taste , i would give the product 4 / 5 stars . people should give it a try since everybody has different opinions . 
=================
we won't be making the switch we're not soda drinkers in our household , an occasional sprite maybe but otherwise i like to mix club soda with fruit juice when i'm in the mood for something bubbly . this sounded intriguing since it's toted as being all natural . i expected a much less sweet flavor , not that it was bad just that it was very very sweet and candy like . i'm also shocked by the high calories , granted juice in general is high calorie but i was still surprised . my husband really liked the taste and even considered it refreshing so your opinion will likely vary pending what you're accustomed to . not something i would give my 5yr old or reach for again myself . 
=================
great cereal , no - so - great packaging we can no longer find this cereal in our stores , so you have been sending us 6 boxes at a time . on the last delivery , the plastic holding the 6 boxes togetherwas so tight that it damaged the bottoms of the boxes . there is no way to makethe boxes stand upright . the cereal is not affected . i just wanted you to beaware of the packing flaw . 
=================
formula is fine , but i'm not so sure i'd call it " earth's best " . . . . . . in fact it might just be the exact same formula as your closest local / national grocery store brand but with the added bonus of costing about 30 % more . we had recently been using this formula until we ran out and i had to make an emergency run to the local grocery store for a quick replacement . the closest thing they had was their organic store brand . funny thing is , when i got home to compare the two i noticed the ingredients are exactly the same as well as some of the machine writing on the bottom of the cans where you can find the sell by date . from what i can gather after doing a bit of research the formula ingredients used to be different but have recently changed without letting customers know . virtually all store brand organic formulas come from one manufacturing plant whether you buy it at store x or y and it seems that earth's best is now being produced in this same facility but charging a premium price . i suggest checking this out for yourself , you might be able to save some money . 
=================
poor shipping but helpful customer service . just wanted to add my two cents in defense of the company . i too received a gift box that the glass was broken in , but one call to the company and about a 45 second phone conversation fixed my problem . they sent out a replacement with no hassle whatsoever . 
=================
tastes just like any other common honey you might eat the description of this honey says it has a rich unique flavor . mine certainly didn't . it tasted just like the cheapest honey you might find in gallon jugs at your local grocer . and by the way , this jar is only 2oz so it's also very pricey for its size .

'soft baked' is catchier than 'crumbly - blandness' length : : 1 : 09 minsthese cookies have an earthen texture and consistency that conjures up images of the mud pies and beach sand cakes my sons used to make . the ingredients note no less than three preservatives ( tbhq , bht and citric acid ) and nearly as many adjectives as nouns - modified , enriched , bleached , reduced and artificial . ugh . instead of referencing my thesaurus for more words to express the crumbly - blandness of these cookies , i decided to make a short video . i'm sure it better illustrates the appetite - suppressing texture . as for the underwhelming taste , i turned to another resource : my sons ( ages 9 and 8 ) are excellent food critics , albeit not the most discerning ones . i need only leave a plate of food within arm's reach while they play board games , their xbox 360 or watch a movie . snacks like watermelon , popcorn or licorice , disappear quickly . however , both boys passed on the quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie opened for the video review . that sums it up for me . rating : one star . do you need to satisfy a sweet tooth ? i recommend eat . think . smile . crispy thins , sweet cinnamon instead .

not a deal found cheaper pricing at a couple of local stores and 2 of the 6 tubs had busted tops from good 'ol ups doing a number on them . i will just buy from local supermarket from now on .

carb count is now higher ! i was very disappointed that they have now raised the carb count in this cereal from 9 net carbs to 16 net carbs . i have insulin resistance and my nutritionist told me this was the only cereal i could have . it tasted great ! my local shoprite stopped carrying it a while ago because it wasn't selling , so i had to purchase it elsewhere . i called the company and they said they were relaunching it in july . i was so happy to see it back on the shelves , but now they've change it . even the sugar level went up . i just wish there was another cereal on the market that had 9 grams of carbs or less . oh well , i'll surely miss it .

great tomatoes , but many cans were dented although the tomatoes were delicious , i might hesitate to order again , since it appeared that the cans were either dented en route , or were taken off the shelf that way . they were also sort of dirty and old looking , so i have a feeling these are items which maybe don't move often enough , and i may have gotten the last of what was on the shelf , dented or not . otherwise shipping was prompt . could have been packed better .

delicate ! so i got this here turkish delight box . these are in my opinion a step away from your average turkish delight ( not that i am a seasoned t . d . consumer ) but they are more than anything just too soft . . . just like winegum even though they are much easier to chew up if you will , and therefore reminiscent of eating plain candy even though they have a very good quality consitency and taste . these come largely without any nuts inside . . maybe the odd bite though . but the sugar coating is excessive and may upset your tummy . don ` t eat to many of these at any one time . ye be warned ! i think i would try to open them up and maybe let them sit a few days to become dry ? ? ( more chewing resistance ) even maybe try to get wrid of some of that sugar coating ? ! anyway i like the way the box opens . side opening with a nice drawout feature and neatly wrapped in a thin plastic foil . so basically these come plain , with the odd bite with some nuts inside . not my favourite . too little fibre maybe ? 
=================
not quite " dried " peppers . . . i dehydrate many types of peppers and then use a coffee grinder to make a powder out of them . i was expecting to be able to do that with these peppers , but they are not dry enough for that . they are closer in texture to the dried apricots you buy to eat out of hand . sort of leathery and pliant . not a big problem , as i just plopped them on the dehydrator for a day until they were brittle / rock hard , and then ground them up . as a precaution , i set the dehydrator outside on the deck to avoid the fumes . they smell incredible - - a lot like chipotle peppers , actually . i tasted just a tiny bit of some of the outer skin , and it was quite hot . i'm sure with the seeds and veins included when ground , it's going to be flaming . there is a fair amount of rope fibers mixed in with the peppers , but i didn't mind this , as it reminded me that these were dried the old fashioned way - by tying and hanging them up . it just took a little time to pull these threads off as i was placing them on the dehydrator trays . i probably could have not bothered with that and just ground up the fibers with the peppers . i'll add to this review when i find out exactly how much " one pound " of these peppers actually weighs when properly dried . 
=================
surprisingly good milk chocolate i tried my first equal exchange bar yesterday . the cocoa flavor is deep and lingers in the mouth , the mark of a good chocolate , beyond what you would expect from the middling 38 % cocoa content ( most premium milk chocolate starts at 40 % , 50 % is common and there are some bars with 60 % cocoa ) . the fact their cacao is sourced from latin america helps , as south america is the ancestral home of cacao , and american cacao ( specially from venezuela , ecuador and trinidad ) tends to be better than the industrial forastero grades grown in africa or indonesia . this chocolate was also conched properly , with a very smooth texture . the hazelnuts it is blended with are hard to discern , however . they may contribute to the smoothness . this is world - class chocolate . i would not hesitate to put it in the same company as the best from valrhona , cluizel , guittard or hachez . the price is relatively moderate for premium chocolate . i tend to be suspicious of the fairtrade label . their certification is expensive , and most of the money goes to pay western experts than the poor farmers it purports to help . i tried " divine " brand chocolates , as the company is actually owned by cocoa farmers in ghana and the ivory coast , but was disappointed with grainy and fairly insipid bars . the good thing about equal exchange is the product stands on its own , even before the feel - good factor . 
=================
too small for tall kitchen size i love these bags , because i can finally compost kitchen scraps without a big mess . but the 13 gallon size is a lot smaller than a polyethelene plastic bag of the same size . it doesnt fit into my 13 gallon trash can , not even close . i'd say the 13 gallon bags are more like 8 gallon bags . perfect for a 5 gallon bucket . 
=================
just alright this product was ok , but due to it's size ( each feeds two ) it does not really work for me . it tastes fine and i will use up what i have for on the go times . 
=================
alright people . . . you want the truth ? read on . . . ok , i've read a lot of people complain about this product , not knowing what the heck they're talking about . i have the truth ( with proof ) about this particular brand of canned tomato . first off , if you know how strict the laws are about wine in france , then the same applies with italians and their tomatoes . if they are not " dop " certified , and grown in san marzano sul sarno , italy , then by law they are not allowed to be called san marzano tomatoes . which now brings me to this product . yes , the brand name is actually san marzano , however , they are not grown nor imported in / from italy . but ( and it's a huge but ) , they are actually san marzano tomatoes . " how can this be ? ? " you ask ? well , they are grown from san marzano tomato seeds ! ahh haaa ! they are locally grown in the us , in the same conditions as san marzano sul sarno , italy with san marzano tomato seeds . probably the closest thing you will find to the real thing , without the cost . i found a website that backs up my info , and also rates every kind of canned san marzano tomato . here is an excerpt of this brand : " this domestic san marzano product has been cultivated in the usa using the same variety of seed used in san marzano , italy , which produces a tomato that is deep red , firm and meaty , and with very few seeds . " if you want to find the website i'm talking about , do a search for : san marzano tomatoes brands & companies , and click on the first link ( sorry , amazon won't let me link to them directly ) . you might learn something about this great product ! there you have it . they never lied , they didn't mislead , they are true to there brand ( literally ! ha ! ) . you're welcome . 
=================
tomatoes - san marzano i was supposed to receive san marzano brand tomatoes , clearly shown on the cans that was in the advertisement , but the cans didn't specify san marzano . i contacted amazon . com and it made good on my order . they sent me a whole new set of cans of the tomatoes ( although the new cans did not say san marzano on them again ) at no cost to me . 
=================
a very good sweetener , but . . . after using the sweetleaf stevia in packets sweetleaf all natural zero calories steviaplus , 100 packets , 3 . 5 ounce boxes ( pack of 2 ) , i switched to the powder form because i thought it would be more cost effective . it probably is , but i find it is very difficult to dissolve in my hot coffee . for some reason , the sweetleaf stevia in packets dissolved with no clumping or sticking to the spoon or side of the cup . this stevia in the shaker jar sticks to both and is very difficult to mix in . unfortunately i purchased the two pkg deal so will stick it out and then go back to the packets . in the meantime , does anyone have a clue why the two products should react so different ? 
=================
excellent ramen but don't overcook it if you are looking for easy comfort food , i can recommend this ramen . it can be dressed up with meat , vegetables or tofu but is tasty just on its own . good for upset stomachs or poor appetites ( it recently got my family through a nasty " tummy bug " ) . one piece of advice - be very careful when you cook it and follow the instructions closely . when overcooked , the noodles are limp and tasteless and not a bit appetizing . i have found that pouring off some of the cooking water after the noodles are cooked , helps too
=================
green almond paste ? if you want everything to taste like very strong almond , with a green color , then buy this . if you are looking for something that tastes like pistachio , keep looking . since you can not return this , make sure that you really want almond flavor in a different nut base , otherwise you might be disappointed . yes , it does have a puddle of oil on top , but that can easily be stirred in , like old fashioned peanut butter . the almond flavor is not something that you can do anything about . 
=================
not really a bargain the jello gets a five star rating , but the price isn't a deal . i didn't do the math before i purchased this from amazon , but i checked my supermarket for its price afterwards . the supermarket sells it for 65 cents , and the amazon price for this item works out to 86 cents a box , so i guess i won't be buying it from amazon again . 
=================
great product for pups but very expensive this is a great product for my two labrador retrievers . they love receiving this treat . the problem is the price keeps increasing . i first purchased these two years ago for about $ 50 for the box of 12 . now , two years later , the price seems to be going up every few months . i'm not sure why the cost increases either . rather than purchase a new box of 12 , i am recylcling the old bones by cleaning them and inserting something else inside the bone ( once the insides have been cleaned out by the dogs ) . these are hard bones and very difficult to break . i haven't seen one broken but have seen one of my dogs chew at it breaking the ends . sometimes you'll get fat bones in the box with lots of filled product and other times you'll receive thin bones . the last 12 i purchased , was around $ 68 for 12 . the entire box had the 6 - inch bones but they were all thin , so practically useless . the box before this last one had fat bones . if the price decreases , i'll buy some new ones to replace the old ones . i have also purchased the cheese and beef filled bones from the same seller . shipping costs are expensive also . add the significant cost to purchase the box of 12 plus shipping , and these days it'll run close to $ 100 which is too expensive for us . i'd recommend the bones , but if you want to try them out first before buying a large quantity , the seller sells singles as well . if the price decreased back under $ 60 and the shipping costs were cheaper , i would have given this a 5 star rating . 
=================
great taste , just be ready for it to come out the other end ! i guess i should have read the reviews before buying this for my sister . just like all these other poor sufferers , by sister , her boyfriend and my mom all had severe diarrhea and stomach cramps just a few hours after eating some . this item should have a warning label : " do not eat more than 10 in one sitting unless you you are constipated and need a quick and easy laxative . " too bad they taste so yummy . i'm going back to the sugar ones . 
=================
good product . . . but buy the 700 - ct amazon sells a 700 - ct for $ 15 . . why would i ever pay $ 35 for 1000 - ct ( plus shipping on 1000 - ct ) . . . . seems crazy . look up the 700 - ct and you'll be siked . 
=================
make a pistachio cake with this ! i made a pistachio cake with the all natural pistachio butter i purchase on amazon . com and , even though i didn't have a recipe , it was wonderful ! i also used some of it in the frosting . sorry i didn't write down the recipe ! i will when i make it again . i do know that i used less butter and added a little more sugar since this product isn't very sweet . floy
=================
be careful . . . this is pie filling not pure pumpkin received it and realized i messed up by getting the " pie mix " verses the pure pumpkin puree . i had gotten the pure pumpkin of this same brand last time and it made the best tasting pumpkin pie , pumpkin bread and pumpkin pancakes i ever had , hands down . this pie mix has a faint underlying , not quite metalic , flavor that i can't quite describe . it's little better than " libby's " brand but not as good as the pure pumpkin . in fact , i like the pure pumpkin so much better , i've already ordered it and i'm going to bring the 10 ( out of 12 ) cans of the pie mix i haven't used to work and give it away . 
=================
problem setting i can't figure out how to load the trap . it comes with two metal levers which you're to use to set the spring , this " will require some strength " ! i would sent it back but i beleive there is a 20 % restocking fee . 
=================
so so all i taste is the chocolate . too much chocolate and not enough raisin . it's like the raisins have 5 coats of chocolate . 
=================
pancake mix this mix was not as expected , for i thought i was buying the 'original' mix which is excellent . . . this mix was satisfactory , but not nearly as good as the original . . . look for that one and you won't be disappointed

a sub - par version of store bought wellness we've been buying this exact formula of wellness for our cocker spaniel " lucy " for over a year now . we thought that it would be worth purchasing on amazon since it was priced almost identically and it would be more convenient than going to petsmart since it would be delivered to our front door . we didn't receive the food for well over a week after we ordered it so we were forced to buy a small bag at the store until we received the food . no big deal . . . we figured next time we'll just order it a couple of weeks in advance so that lucy's food supply isn't as low and we have plenty until we get the next bag . after feeding her two meals of the bag we got from amazon , lucy started having violent diarrhea . i'm familiar with the fact that changing foods can cause an upset stomach with dogs but this is the exact same food we have been feeding her for a very long time . . . . . or so we thought . we knew that the only thing that changed in lucy's diet was the fact that we ordered the food from amazon . so we went and bought another small bag of the same stuff from petsmart . much to our disappointment , there was an obvious difference in the appearance of the food . the bag from amazon had chunks that were misshaped , very porous and even smelled different . our conclusion was that amazon received the reject bags at a discount and sold them as the same product . we then stopped feeding lucy the amazon bag and switched her back to the store bought bag . immediately her bowls improved . although we were refunded for our purchase we had to jump through a few hoops that weren't worth the time we wasted to do so . please reconsider before you purchase this food . wellness is an amazing product and we're proud to feed our little lucy the best food that we possibly can but this is not up to the quality that wellness is known for . i'm going to post pics of both the amazon bought food and the store bought food so that you can see the difference . 
=================
unclear amount of product being sent does the info mean 3 boxes with 12 in each for total of 36 or does it mean you only get 12 total ? ? why no free shipping on it when it's over 25 . 00 ? 
=================
ok organic , ok . with the shipping , this product can be found cheaper in local markets . not sure what they have for the picture , since this product looks like a deep , dark orange powder , not a green grain .

label information i'm sitting here with the sprout holiday vegetable dinner package of baby food in hand and i don't know where the reviewer came up with the salt content . calories : 140 ; total fat : 4 grams ; sodium : 20mg ; carbs : 24 grams ; sugars : 4 grams ( since there is 20 grams difference between the carbs and the sugars , this generally indicates there are no additional sugars added and what is there is from the natural sugar in the veggies ) fiber : 2 grams ; protein 4 grams ; in fact , i have looked at several of the sprout baby food packages and their sodium is quite low . i was in the middle of the ordering process to get this from amazon when the review caught my attention in regard to the sodium content and i had to comment ! 
=================
e150a water best described as a mix of urine and white wine . this is one of the worst blended whiskys on the market . berry bros & rudd dumped this brand on to the edrignton group in 2010 . as part of the terms , bb & r received rights to the glenrothes brand . bb & r wins ! one has to wonder why it took them so long . bb & r also produce a fine blended whisky called blue hanger . . . great stuff but impossible to find in the us . avoid cutty sark ! 
=================
habanero are hotter then these i was very cautious and cut off a small corner of the pepper and set it on my tongue to see what they tasted like . i was very surprised that it wasn't that " hot " that i was expecting , and that they are rather sweet . i would almost say that these are cayenne peppers if not for the sweet taste to them . though these aren't all that hot , they still go great in chili ! only 2 stars because they taste great . just not hot at all to me . 
=================
not from china i'm sick of hearing about all the poison the chinese put in dog food so as to make a buck . it was truly refreshing to find a product that contains nothing from china and the dog loves it and it's good for him . what a deal ! ! 
=================
not the large ones ! there is nothing you could say that would make an atomic fireball be bad ! ! i was disappointed though that these are the little ones , not the larger ones you typically see . my fault for not asking ! 
=================
dissolves in mouth i find the crisps dissolve in your mouth and aren't especially filling . it's pretty tasty and an unbelievable 40 calories per pack . but i think i'll stick to regular apples as more filling and tastier . 
=================
excellent product , but be careful ! i bought this grass for my very picky ( tortoiseshell ) cat and she loved it . every time she walked through the room she would either rub her face on the plant or take a few bites . if i so much as dared to touch it while she was nearby she would swat my hand away ! and she's an indoor / outdoor cat , so it isn't like this is her only option for fiber either . i say " be careful " because after about two weeks i noticed she stopped eating it , then by the third week it was all wilted and brown . i'm no greenthumb by any means , but it seems i should have used a free draining pot ( like the instructions say to do . . . i'm just an idiot ) instead of the opaque , closed - bottom one i chose . it turns out i had the grass swimming , and when i dumped out the pot it was probably the foulest smelling mush on earth . i had to open all my windows and run the attic fan to clear out the stench ! that's not the product's fault at all , hence five stars . in fact , i'm about to reorder and start a new batch since she liked it so much . i'm just throwing this review up here so other inexperienced growers like me can hopefully avoid the same mistake !

made in china but my dog hasnt had any problems i understand the concerns that people have about these being made in china but my dog chip hasnt had any problems with them .

near best but so many are so good there is good and bad aspects . most conspicuous is that too much water comes through in twenty seconds . double fills more than half a regular coffee cup with 22 sec . brews . too watery ? rules are relative in my world . i could brew shorter times for 2oz doubles but i don't . this tastes so good even with the extra water . tiny bit of sugar and none i like better . always trying lots of different expressos although i avoid any @ $ 10 / lb and above . costco had a sulawesi estate 2 . 5lb for $ 12 ( close ? ) close second to lavazza . beans not pods so less convenient . went through 7 . 5lbs selawesi then gone . waiting for return ? been brewing espresso for twenty plus years and pretty fast at it so grinding with my rocky is easy . so , its a little watery so what ? it tastes good , really good . been around a long time and huge following . guess their bean mix is big secret . it is soft , smooth , mild , low acid , imho lucaffe classic 150 pods also good . stronger more acid and heck the red package is pretty . lots of local and national brands and flavors . some seem to get into the " get what you pay for " or " if it cost more it is better " hoping it appeals to baser instincts . if you can pay $ 10lb and do it again and again with no thought to cost let's drink yours , lolflavor for cost and convenience puts this pod lavazza gran crema high on my list of favorites . since you can brew pods why not try that variety pack and see what you like ? almost all of them are excellent and some are acceptable none were bad that i can remember . several from that sampler can be bought like this lavazza offer . i have consumed two or three of these 150 lavazza boxes . mixing with beans and other pods each 150 box lasted about a year . when i am tired , it's late , and i think of it , i reach for a couple lavazza pods for quick and easy espresso . price on this varies . first paid about $ 41 and now $ 51 . sorry just noticed price went up in last week to $ 55 . seen it for $ 60 + for 150 pods . they are sealed so no hurry to consume . only fresh beans make crema like pods . one week and flavor begins to taper with slightly finer grinds required to maintain 22sec brews with most coffee beans . never tried to figure the cost per pound equivalent with pods . maybe i don't want to know , lol

good bag , but they don't fit a bags on board dispenser i don't know why i thought these bags would fit in my bags on board bone dispenser . maybe i was just hoping . still , a great bag that is truly biodegradable ( unlike bags on board )

good hardcore licorice ! i believe the world is divided into two groups : those that eat black licorice and those that don't . i belong to the first group , which i also find to be superior . ( just kidding , kind of ) . i'm always looking for black licorice and cannot get enough of it . i find licorice from europe to be superior to that found in the states . gustaf's licorice is made in the uk , specifically where , i don't know . it comes in a huge and heavy 5 lb bag . it contains a long list of ingredients , including beef gelatine . okay , that's gross . it also has desiccated coconut , whatever that is . the licorice is not shiny like in the picture , but dull , like a tractor tire . it smells good and has a nice pungent taste to it . ( the beef gelatin perhaps ? ) it's all stuck together but comes apart easily . it's a bit soft for my liking , but hopefully it will harden up over time . despite the disgusting addition of beef gelatin to my licorice ( i know gelatin is from hooves , but do you have to remind me ? ) i will eat this licorice . i have uploaded a picture to show everyone how this mass of licorice really looks , just so you don't stock up for parties . will i order it again ? probably not . i want a company to lie to me about where gelatin comes from . gustaf is just too honest for his own good . 
=================
bad reaction i bought this product on the strength of the reviews but after one or two days of taking it i had a bad reaction to it including dizziness and the onset of depression and anxiety . someone mentioned that maca is a strong her and made their heart race a little after taking it . another person said their skin broke out in a rash . yet another reviewer mentioned alphalpha - which this product has and which is meant to be bad for some reason ( i'll do the research later ) my only interpretation personally for me as to why my body reacted to it is the chemical additives e . g silica which is a well known neurotoxin . i have a very sensitive central nervous system and thought i would take this to get essential nutrients . but i think the multiple combinations and the large quantities of each herb / veg was just too much . i have since binned it and i'm scared to ever try it again . since then i've bought a juicer and juice cabbage , cucumber , carrots , celery and other veg everyday and that's worked out much better for me in terms of boosting my energy , memory and concentration than this nightmare powder did .

swheatscoop for rabbits one of my rabbits found the swheat scoop irresistable to eat and an impacted stomach has resulted with my rabbit now being in the hospital for the last few days , with this litter impaction located in her stomach . subsequently i found out on a quick web search that there is information on this product and its detriment to rabbits , on the hrs , house rabbit society website , as well as several other online locations . i'm certain this product is great for cats however , and i would continue to use it for my cat if i didn't have rabbits .

strongest k - cup coffee out there this fog chaser was available at my local grocery store . i thought i would give it a try . well let me tell you , even on the highest setting this cup is strong . reminds me of a regular pot of dark communittee coffee . if you think the regular k - cups are just too weak , give this a try and you won't be disappointed .

works for a minute . . . gives you pain for hours i never drink energy drinks . i'm in college and all of my friends drink them like they are water . i never got the point of it . but today it was 2 pm i could barely keep my eyes open and i had class from 3 : 30 till 9 : 00 . i needed energy and fast . then the commercial for 5 - hour energy popped in my head , " 2 : 30 feeling " i knew some of my friends used it , so i thought why not give it a try . i figured it was small so it wouldn't do that much harm . i drank half of the bottle and within minutes i know longer felt like i was falling asleep . unfortunately 10 minutes later i was feeling more tired than before . i decided to drink the rest of the bottle . once again a quick 5 minute burst of energy and then back to exhaustion . then everything got worse . around an hour after drank the drink i found myself doubling over in stomach pain and throwing up . it has been 7 hours since i drank it and i feel like i just got hit by a train . instead of helping me get through class the 5 - hour energy made it nearly impossible .

petowners beware dog food has changed alot over the past few years . as pet owners were willing to spend more money feeding their pets , larger corporations bought out the smaller dog food companies and changed the ingredients without notifying the customers . this was particularly true of the more expensive brands that contained the higher quality ingredients . real meat and rice were substituted with " meat by - product " and cheap imported grains ( particularly corn ) that were determined to be " unfit for human consumption " . they are taking ingredients that used to be considered " waste " and packaging it up as " healthy & nutritious " food for your beloved pet . our once healthy pets are contracting debilitating diseases and dying because of the toxic waste materials that are currently being marketed as pet food . blue buffalo is one of the few remaining companies that , at least to my knowledge , has not " sold - out " yet . the food really is nutritious and still contains real meat with no by - products , fillers , corn or soy . we switched our dogs over this past summer after having lost one to an autopsy / toxicology verified case of " aflatoxin poisoning " from the " healthy & nutritious " dog food we were buying and feeding him . this was not cheap food folks . this was a well - known brand , highly marketed as " natural " , that we were paying $ 60 / bag for . the fda analysis of this food verified that it contained toxins , but nothing was done to the dog food manufacturer . they are still producing their " high priced waste " and heavily marketing it as " natural " . my advice to pet owners : read the ingredients labels thoroughly and often ! blue buffalo a great product that you can still feed your pets with confidence . because it doesn't contain any cheap fillers , it's more satisfying to your dog so you don't need to feed as much of it thus making it still relatively economical . don't wait until it's too late for your beloved pet .

be careful i bought these treats at petsmart for my older dogs . one dog is a 100lb amstaff and the other is a 100lb great dane / black lab / gsd mix and both are 11 years old . i was looking for treats that are made in america and that were softer than rawhides because their teeth aren't as strong as they used to be , but they still love to chew . well , when i was out in the yard scooping this weekend i discovered that these treats are not being digested . at all . in addition , both of my dogs have thrown up chunks of these treats over the past week . one earlier this week and one today . this from two dogs who have never had stomach issues in the past . i'd be very careful about giving these ( or the peanut butter flavor ) to your dogs . it's nice that they're made from natural ingredients and are made in the usa , but if they can't be digested then they're not worth buying .

the nut milk bag that gets it right this ( and maybe diana stobo's 2 qt bag - not sure because it's shaped differently ) have got it right - no seams along the bottom to pop while you're squeezing pulp , no material that stretches , and a drawstring top , just like it should be . now if only someone could come out with a nut milk bag that gets * completely clean * in the wash , even after soaking . oh , well . . . i will say , though , that this is small . consider buying her 2 qt one instead if you're starting with more than just a cup or two of pulpy mixture .

uh oh this shampoo has a silky , smooth texture and a clean , fresh smell . however . after about a half dozen washes , my scalp started to itch like crazy . no shampoo has ever done that to me before . after reading the other amazon . com reviews i notice at least one other user had skin problems with this shampoo . fair warning : it's not for everyone .

ineffective if you are pondering whether or not to purchase this product - first mostly , do your research . the reviews on this state some insects were caught - however , some say they weren't effective . just take a moment and realize that yes , they cost cheap - however , did you know that they use pheromone technology ? did you know that pheromone's only work on certain types of insects ? for instance , sure you can get a pheromone to attract women but however , only a few women will respond to the pheromone product for women . this concludes that pheromones that this product contains is less effective with certain insects . if your home is infested with centipedes and home spiders - the best recommendation that has worked for my wife and i is raid barrier . it's very effective and over for a past week we seen dramatic results in the reduction amount of spiders and centipedes . you may have greater results by spraying raid around the outside and some inside ( isolated rooms ) . do yourself a favor and pass this product up and go now purchase raid barrier . works like a charm and will keep your home safe and comfortable .

new orleans coffee for real coffee drinkers ! i was raised smelling community coffee being roasted in new orleans and started drinking it 1 / 2 community / 1 / 2 milk when i was 5 yrs old , as just about all kids did . community is all that we drink ! if the dark roast is too stronge , blend it yourself with medium or milder blend . if the community chickory is a bit too much for you , you can blend it also with a " no chickory " , milder blend . i really didn't appreciate the buyer that said it was " bad coffee " ! ! ! they just don't know what good is , che' ! it's the flavor of new orleans ! maybe drinking on a balmy day , in an open - air setting by the mississippi river and the french quarter with beniets would make it much better . if you're not able to do that , then here's a way to at least experience the best tasting coffee at home . enjoy !

don't accept the substitute summary by durkee said their steak dust was the same as tone's steak dust , and in fact durkee makes it for tone's . well , the results are in after several cook - outs and i don't believe they taste the same . the tone's flavor is much more intense and i usually use quite sparingly , just a dusting . if i do the same with the durkee's - i can't taste anything ! the original steak dust i tried was called montreal steak dust , but now i can't find that anywhere , nor the tone's steak dust . bummer ! atl

tea is terrific but amazon dropped the ball tetley decaffeinated greet tea is the best tasting tea i have found . when i ordered it on amazon through their subscription program , they sent one box of tea , not a pack of six . for $ 22 + that was very expensive tea . they refilled the order and again only one box of tea was sent . i'm not comfortable trying to order it again . i look forward to hearing of other people who placed their orders and did receive a pack of 6 boxes of tea for this order . amazon refunded my purchase price and let me keep the two boxes of tea by the way . the only reason i gave this one star was because of the order fulfillmet problems . amazon is terrific and tetley tea is the best . phyllis @ gr8findsonline

doberman loves it first off , if you compare the price of this by weight to regular food that is loaded with corn and rice , don't . my dogs eat about 1 / 2 as much of this food because there is actual nutrition in this and not a bunch of filler . i slowly cycled this food into their old food , because it's quite a change and if you don't your dog could be making awful messes . imagine not eating red meat for a month and then slamming a big ol' steak . i went with the fish and potato because my doberman has some skin issues . the dry skin cleared up after a while . for some reason none of the dogs will eat the black bits in the food . there aren't a lot of them , but i think it's odd . the only thing i really don't like about this food is the smell . if you don't close the bag up tight it can smell very fishy around it , and your dogs breath will smell a little fishy after they eat it . other than that the pooches seem happy . 
=================
there are better options it isn't a bad product and if you are using a lot it is cheaper : however , there are better options . it is a little acidic and less sweet than other products . i've found it locally that is only twice the price . great if you add a little sugar . 
=================
loriann the flavor is good but the pasta is way past al dente . mushy really . this is something i would only eat if there was nothing else available . i like a lot of the other dinners in this product line . 
=================
hot but not too hot i expected this harissa to be super hot . it's hot , but it doesn't burn your tongue off or make your eyes tear . really smooth with merguez sausage ! 
=================
not too bad these peach rings are pretty decent . the flavor is a bit too sweet , but overall ok . sadly , these were not sour as i had thought they were . 
=================
better choices for your loved one please dont buy dog food with corn as the main ingredient . . . they cant digest it . . . . and it will pass it through . . . . spend a little more and you will be glad you did . . . . . . as in less dog waste . . . . better fur and a happy full dog . . . with a little internet research a 20 # bag will cost about $ 5 more . . . . . is it worth it to you ? ? ? ?

not very healthy ? my son loves these milks and we used to get them for him when we went to starbucks . i was familiar with the horizon brand and thought that the vanilla flavor would be fine . i began to notice a few times after drinking this he would say his tummy hurt or he would act sick ( really tired ) shortly after drinking them . i read the label and saw 29g of sugar . . . yeah holy cow ! when we serve him a flavored milk i give him gerbers smart sips , they have vanilla and mild vanilla flavor with 11g of sugar , i think the mild vanilla has even less grams of sugar . he still loves the taste too ! i find them in the babyfood aisle at the grocery store .

standard kefir directions do not work with this product when i received this product it came with the wrong directions , but hey , in this modern day the internet can fix this situation . . . except that it can't . i tried several you tube videos , many blogs , they all seemed to have the same directions for milk kefir grains . these directions did not work for my purchased grains , and i did try a number of times . i gave up because who really has the time to trouble shoot something that should be very simple . after being contacted by the seller ( who seems concerned and helpful ) i learned that with this product you really have to let the seller guild you through the process , hold your hand , because their grains are just that much more potent then anyone elses . also , you shouldn't expect to be able to drink more then 1 / 2 a cup every week or two because these grains are just that potent . . . . of course after 4 rounds in milk my grains didn't grow . . . so maybe mine weren't that potent . in the end i didn't have a lot of time to commit to dealing with lifetime kefir . if you want yummy digestible kefir instead of milk in your smoothies and on your granola do not buy this , buy another product , with instructions , that seems to match other's opinions of what kefir's potency should be for someone who enjoys it . but if you do have the time and you don't like to drink a lot of kefir but want the benefits this is perfect for you . the seller is very responsive and helpful and very concerned with your happiness . but you do have to take the time to have a conversation over email instead of just looking up the solution yourself .

i think it's awesome ! i'm what you may call a cream soda buff . i love it , it's always been my favorite flavor . . . and no soda will taste quite as good as the cane sugar varieties , but i'm sort of on a caloric budget , and cannot afford to go drinking all my calories . i love this stuff . it's great , perhaps it's an aquired taste , but i've been drinking naturally diet sodas for over a year , and i was so excited to try the cream soda version . i prefer it over all the other flavors ( i haven't tried grape yet , that's my next priority ) . i tried a few other brands of stevia and xylitol flavored cream sodas and none of them match up to this one . i say it's definitely worth a try . * * * * update ( 8 / 8 / 2011 ) * * * i'm irritated . i'm not mad at the product , it's still delicious ; but when i got the package i ordered from amazon . com , it had been through a lot . it was smashed on one side , and sure enough , 3 of the sodas were ruined , had exploded all over the other sodas , and many had been deformed due to some horrific accident . amazon . . . i have never had such a horrible problem from you before , but this is my first food purchase . it makes me very unlikely to order another food especially beverage package again , and i'm a pretty frequent customer . i wish you would make it right . i realize it may have been the mail carrier , but perhaps amazon needs to package the beverages better or put a fragile sign on it or something . just a suggestion . sad day for my delicious cream sodas .

food particle gets stuck in handle at first i was so excited about the beaba ! i even called all my friends and raved about it . now after 10 months of use , i don't like to use it anymore . why ? well because food particles end up stuck in the handle . the handle is made hallow so that the water can travel to the container and " steam " the food . this is a great idea , however , the beaba designers forgot one very important aspect : you can't remove the handle and take it apart to clean ! food particles get stuck in the handle and there is no way to clean . i am a clean freak and i have tried everything to clean the handle . i even used toothpick to get into the small opening of the handle , but nothing worked . i now use a mini food processor and even if i have to steam veggies or fruit separately , the mini food processor is much stronger , can puree faster and make the food smoother . so yes , i loved it at first , but now i have fallen out of love . i used my beaba daily , so maybe if you won't use yours much , then , it might be a good choice , but if you plan to use it daily and plan to use it for a while , you will see what i mean about the little pieces of food stuck in the handle . 
=================
not a very good food . my view of this product has changed since we have been feeding halo ; the cats seem healthier and happier . the kitten's coat was getting very rough and now is smooth and silky . i'm told that you should feed the best you can afford , and this food is expensive , but not very high - quality , as far as we could tell . plus , our kitten gained too much weight on it .

blaahh i absolutely love irish cream coffee from any cafe i've ever gone to . so naturally when i got my keurig a couple months ago , i tried this one out since it was a great price . i guess there is a reason timothys is cheaper ! ! this coffee has a nice irish cream smell , but the taste is weak and bland . the rest of their coffee is nothing special either .

kind of a miss i love sweet tea and i am not even a southerner . there is something special about sweet tea that when it is mixed right , it tastes wonderful . unfortunately , this sweet tea concentrate missed the mark . first of all , the package was leaking upon arrival . not too much to return the product . when i opened it , the mixture had an artificial candy - like scent . okay , it is suppose to be sweet . the big problem was the instructions . " just a few drops . " huh ? not to be overly anal but do you mean short drops or long drops . is a few 3 , 4 , 5 , or more ? without a clear measurement , it is hard to find that " sweet spot " . mcdonalds use a syrup concentration such as this one ( i assume ) and the flavor is always consistent . that is important to me . if they want to improve on the product , add something like  teaspoon per 8 oz water or something similar . otherwise , if you want to experiment with getting just the right ratio of mix to water , have at it . i don't have time and if i did , chances are i would never get it perfect again . 
=================
sweet ! eaten by themselves , yacon slices are pretty bland . the taste and texture is somewhat akin to dried apples . i mostly use yacon in the blender , as a raw chocolate smoothie sweetener , supplementing the goji berries , cacao nibs and some frozen fruit , like blueberries , and maybe some kale . it makes a sweet counterpoint to the bitter stuff like the chocolate and the veggies . yum . supposedly , there are also a lot of health benefits to yacon , and is a diabetic - friendly sweetener . and since it bypasses the gi tract and instead gets processed in the colon , yacon helps balance the gut flora and aids in digestion . 
=================
expensive but good sugar free candy the price is too high but i like to eat these gummi candies because they are chewey and sugar - free . eating too much at one time will bother your digestive tract . 
=================
adds a little extra something when making your own mochas . this syrup has been serving me well ! i put in a little bit for each mocha i make at home ( without it , my mochas felt bland and didn't taste like coffee very much ) . it's been making my mochas taste a lot better . my only issue is that it has high fructose corn syrup , which unfortunately , many syrups do but i try to use this in moderation . 
=================
quality product but not great taste i was disappointed in this tea , expecting more of a sweet spicy orange flavor but finding it to be just overall sour with very little spice shining through . i have tried it sweetened and unsweetened . i have steeped it for longer and shorter periods . it is palatable in all cases but never very good . i do find that if i steep it for a short period of time and add a little sweetener that helps reduce the sour taste , but then it is just rather bland .

would love to say it worked i am a mother who had been successfully exclusively breastfeeding for over three months . i noticed my supply was getting less and less and was told by a couple of people said to try this herb . as i said in the title , i really would love to say it worked for me , but after taking this product , as directed , in hopes of boosting my milk supply , it failed to deliver . i am not saying it may not work for others , but all it did for me was make me smell like maple syrup , and not in a good way . maybe it will work for you as it has for others .

harney and sonse pomegranate oolong iced tea i received this order late ( according to the tracking information i received ) . oddly enough , the shipping box arrived in perfect condition , but the actual tin that the tea came in was dented . this may not mean much , except you pay quite the price for the tin , and i found the dented tin annoying . i can only " assume " the company sent me a dented tin , based on the shipping box .

these just don't do it for me as breath mints to me , these are nothing like the regular altoids and are not breath mints . they are pleasant - tasting little candies in a cute convenient tin , and that's as far as it goes . the mintiness is just not strong , and the wintergreens are definitely weaker than the peppermint minis . i'm not a dragon - breath person , but still , one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my breath . four or five will freshen my breath for a short while - maybe 15 minutes . at this point , i think the icebreakers frost mints are the best as sugar free breath mints . 
=================
5 stars silk - 0 stars on expiration silk is great stuff , and these aseptic packages are supposed to be good for a year . that doesn't do much good when there is less than 2 months left on the product when received . i stocked up for the winter in case we can't get to town to buy fresh . ordering silk via amazon is a bogus shopping experience ; they can't be returned because 'technically' there is nothing wrong with the product . 5 stars if you're drinking it next week . 0 stars if you're stocking up for 6 months from now . 
=================
they taste good but . . . i like the taste however they give me sores on my tongue . other flavors dont do this . i think its the spicy ingredients . i wont buy these again , ill probably go with ranch or something . 
=================
good everyday coffee i have usually ordered my k - cups direct from green mountain , but thought i'd try amazon's larger package and subscribe / save . the box of 50 works out to about a month's supply of coffee for me , with drinking a couple of cups a day . the taste is good - - it's not a strong coffee , for that you need something like green mountain coffee's extra bold . green mountain coffee , dark magic ( extra bold ) k - cup portion pack for keurig brewers , 50 - countit's not too heavy of a coffee , but none of the cups i have brewed have been the weak water that a few other reviews suffered from . bad batches and bad quality control may be the issue . if you double - check the prices and get a good batch , it's a better than average cup of coffee .

bijol the depiction of the condiment is of one larger than the one sent and is misleading . the weight is correct .

works , sort of well , it attracts moths well , as indicated by the " powder " marks on the tape . on the other hand , it has yet to trap even one of them . i think i can hear them laughing at me right now .

corn flakes with a twist i found this item while searching for granola and berries and looked forward to it's arrival . however , i was very disappointed with the abundance of corn flakes . like other reviewers the amount of granola crumbs is disheartening too . the triple berries are yummy and i would have enjoyed this without the cornflakes . there's too many cornflakes to pick out . . . yes the thought crossed my mind ! 
=================
price ? nothing is wrong with the product but the price is stupid for a condament . it's not a meal just something you add to a meal . it shouldn't be almost $ 7 a jar . i will only buy it when it's on sale . i use mayo , which by the way has no flavor . but it's very rare for me to use mayo , just don't like the taste .

=================
not a time or effort saver i wish i had thought about this purchase a little longer . it takes a large space to work on the sifting , the clumps have to be dumped from a large container into a trash bag , then the litter from one large container to another , after the sifter is reinserted . clear enough if you look at the picture , yet i didn't really think it through . it is hard to do without spillage , and so can be pretty messy and it seems like a major operation . i'm currently using sifting liners inserted into this contraption and ignoring its sifting capabilities altogether . i find them much easier . and , they keep the box clean . in this , you can't really use a liner and now there are three large pieces that need to be cleaned . 
=================
very strong flavor , use like oyster / hoisin sauce i bought this because of the reviews that its salty and savory . i tried it spread on bread with some butter as that seems the traditional route . . . wow was that a bad idea . it's not horrible , just the flavor is so strong as to be over powering . but it gave the strong impression of hoisin / oyster sauce , two sauces i love but would never spread on toast . so i just tried some mixed in with some ground beef the way i would use those two , a little goes a long way . worked great , the flavor mixed well and added a nice background flavor to the beef . so it definitely has a place in my life , just not with butter and toast , those two are fine on their own . 
=================
straight up ? no way ! you may be wondering why the price of this juice is so high . the reason is its purity . the label says it all : just cranberry . there are many health benefits to drinking cranberry juice , but the sugar in most of the brands counteracts these benefits . the price listed here is what my grocery store sells for 10 bottles , not the full case of 12 . so , you sort of get 2 freebies ! my palette cannot tolerate this juice at full throttle . i like to fill up my one liter bottle with filtered water and about 4 ounces of the cranberry juice twice a day . i often add some ginger people ginger juice ( 12x5 oz ) for added health benefits and better taste . 
=================
the good and the bad the good - necco wafers can get stale if they're in inventory for too long . these weren't . they were fresh and tasted great , if you love necco wafers , and i do . the bad - even though obvious effort had been made to pack them properly , the box was badly battered and the contents had shifted so that the wafers were not at all protected by the little air bags that probably had surrounded them when they were given over to the shippers . thirty six rolls of wafers with , i'm guessing , at least 50 wafers per roll . that would be a minimum of 1800 wafers . all but , perhaps 50 wafers total were broken . . . some just into two or three pieces , but many were smashed to granules . i actually had to put them into a bowl and eat them with a spoon . i really was disappointed .

healthy & tasty pasta blob this pasta clumps together during cooking and turns into a lump of goo . it has good flavor , although i prefer my fettuccine to spin around my fork . 
=================
candy cornmeal this is not candy corn , candycorn meal at best . it was difficult to find even one kernel with all three colors intact . i live in texas and i have seen candy corn in better condition after being thrown around in a highschool student's trunk all summer . amazon packed the bags perfectly well . the barcode on one of the bags shows this , as no amount of poor packaging could make the barcode sticker as worn as it was . seller should describe these as grocery seconds or damaged . 
=================
i didn't like the taste it's been a long time since i've purchased this sort of cookie , and i was surprised by how sweet they are . it's overpowering . it doesn't even taste like chocolate . i just get sweet sweet sweet in my mouth , and there isn't any other data getting to my brain . after i eat the cookie , the aftertaste is actually a bit noxious . i also requested a different flavor from this brand , and surprisingly , they taste great . these simply don't . i love chocolate chip cookies , but perhaps i'm spoiled because i bake a lot . these are simply too processed and sweet for me . and i'm no snob . i love cheap junk food . they are chewy , and they are filled with some kind of super sweet frosting , but it's just too darn sweet . makes my teeth hurt just thinking about it . also , when i cleaned out my desk i discovered one of these cookies had fallen out of my lunch bag a few weeks before . it probably spent five weeks in the open air , and yet it was identical to a fresh cookie from the original package . no bugs had touched it . it hadn't dried out . whatever they are using to preserve this product is potent . i realize prospective customers for this product are not looking for martha stewart's $ 100 chef inspired perfect cookie , but they probably want something that is reasonably wholesome and tastes less like chemicals and corn syrup . 
=================
overpowering cinnamon at first sip , this tea was pleasantly sweet and abruptly becomes overwhelming with the sharp , dry taste of cinnamon . holding the tea in your mouth for a few seconds and allowing the aromas to circulate through the mouth reduced the nasty aftertaste . watering it down a bit and adding a few drops of honey reduced the potency , as well . the sharpness of the cinnamon is too much for this tea to really be enjoyed and the remaining sachets will likely be used to spice a few gallons of apple cider .

=================
i wish i liked these ! i bought these because of the high nutrional value and i was really hoping to like these , but . . . . i don't ! since these have gotten such good review here , i'm hoping someone at work will like these . i think you'll either love these or hate them ! 
=================
wish it was cheesier . . . . i am going to drop it into soup . not very tasty on it's own . it's a texture and flavour thing . 
=================
sweet and messy i was expecting something a bit more on the salty side , but these bars are definitely sweet . the peanut butter layer was on the bottom and after spending the morning in my postlady's truck was very melted and very messy . i would not recommend storing these in a warm place or in a lunchbox unless they were near an ice pack as the melted peanut butter coated the inside of the wrapper and made my fingers very sticky . as a nutritional snack they don't make the cut with 220 calories and 13 grams of fat per bar . they were yummy and filling , but i'd prefer a bit more salt flavor to offset the sweetness . i might pick them up on sale , but i can't see this being added to my pantry as a 'must have' item .

shirataki rice i do use a lot of shirataki noodles while dieting however the shirataki rice is my least favorite form of the konkac root product . .

chock full of beans these cans are really full of beans . in addition to the health benefits of bpa free can linings , you definitely get your money's worth with eden beans , compared to some other organic brands which have bpa in the can linings , way too much water and fewer beans per can . i bought the unsalted ones because they were on sale but actually prefer the salted ones . it seems i have to add way too much salt when i use these , but other than that they are cooked just right and as mentioned , the can is full of beans . 
=================
msg i really love sazon , i grew up on this stuff . i would love to use it again if they would get with the times and cut out the msg . everyone knows msg is horrible for you , i'm sure goya got the memo as well . 
=================
buy this syrup if you want erythritol as a sweetener erythritol is the only intestine - friendly sugar alcohol and has the most sweetness per caloric content of any sugar alcohol . sucralose , on the other hand , is also in this product and is made by manipulating sugar molecules with chlorine . . yuck . regardless , i prefer this ingredient list to other chocolate syrups . ingredients : water , erythritol , glycerin , cocoa , natural flavors , citric acid , xanthan gum , salt , potassium sorbate , sodium benzoate , caramel color , acesulfame potassium , sucralose , vanillin , artificial flavor , zinc sulfate vitamin e acetate , niacinamide and biotin . there is a bitter aftertaste , but it's sugar free for a reason and i'm sure anyone interested in this product will get used to it . 
=================
love instant breakfast , hate the strawberry wow . apparently i have different taste buds than the other reviewers - and that's okay . i just personally find the strawberry flavor to be disgusting . i haven't bought instant breakfast in a long time , but i don't remember it tasting like that before . anyway , i don't recommend the strawberry variety , but it is a good product in other flavors . also , i have purchased other groceries through amazon and been very happy , so i would recommend this method of purchasing it if you do like it . 
=================
citric acid + petrochemical flavor ( but not in a bad way ) these remind me of now & laters in that they've got an interesting tangy - sweet taste with a subtle petrochemical flavor . like now & laters they taste nothing like fruit , but that's not what they're going for . i'm not a big fan of regular twizzlers but i like these a lot - too bad they're not low calorie . they're a bit dangerous because they seem like they should be filling , but they really aren't so you can eat a lot of them without thinking about it . best to portion out a few ahead of time & put the bag well out of reach . 
=================
was expecting 2 ( 1 lb ) bags i baught a 1 lb bag before ( who needs a 2 lb bag open ? ) but thats alright . i use around 4 tb a week to make bread , buns , rolls and whatnot . the yeast is cheap but it isnt easily storable since the bag is big and needs a bigger ziplock i store mines in the fridge so the yeast doesnt activate from moisture in the air ) 
=================
arrived spoiled i like the maruman brand and was thrilled to find that this miso was organic , so i didn't hesitate to order . however , the product arrived spoiled , probably due to warping during shipping of the ultrathin plastic tub . disappointing . 
=================
price hike i thought the convienience and savings would make it worth it to order this as a subscribe and save , but when i went back to reorder , the price had tripled . . . amazon should notify of these changes . they should also only offer items for subcribe and save that they can continue to offer at the same price and those that will also be available long term . . . .

made for gf newbies ! i am a gf newbie . there i said it . ; - ) in the beginning , i tried to buy all the flours and mix all the ingredients to get a general all purpose gluten free flour . what a mess , what an expense ! i then started trying the gf flour blends like bob's red mill , pamela's etc . eh . . didn't care for them . i stumbled upon better batter and gave it a try . this stuff was made for gf newbies ! substitution is close to cup for cup for wheat with the addition of a little extra liquid . i am now making breads , cakes , cookies once again and having them turn out instead of flop or turn into bricks . wish i had known about better batter when we first started on the gluten free diet . that would have saved me time and money .

poor consistancy i bought this from the omaha website and was unable to write a review there so i am writing it here . i have purchased from omaha and amazon many times and this was me second chateaubriand . the first was outstanding just like everything from omaha in the past but this second chateaubriand was not up to par . first the taste was not the same and it was not nearly as tender as the first . i will buy again but i hope for better results . thanks for reading .

tasted fermented i am not at all fond of the switch black cherry . it tasted fermented , almost alcoholic , to me . i asked my husband to try it for his opinion and he said it reminded him of smirnoff black ice ( which , i can't say i have tried , so i can't personally confirm his flavor comparison ) . the can touts " 100 % of what you want , 0 % of what you don't want " explaining what it contains ( 100 % juice , 100 % rda vitamin c , all natural , carbonation , great taste and refreshment ) and what it doesn't contain ( no sugar added , no corn syrup , no preservatives , no artificial colors , gluten free ) . it has 130 calories , 0g fat , 15mg sodium , 35g carbs ( 33g sugar ) , 0g protein , and 100 % vitamin c . the ingredients list reads , " 100 % juice ( filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates , apple , grape , acerola , and cherry juice concentrates ) , natural flavors , ascorbic acid ( vitamin c ) . i appreciate the attempt to make a " natural " carbonated juice beverage , but this drink is not for me . i hope you enjoy it more .

inflation product is good ; my cats like it . but the price just keeps climbing . i will have to train my cats to eat cheaper cat food .

meh . . . not a fave , prefer the other blonde when starbucks came out with the " blonde " roasts , i got pretty excited because i prefer lighter roasts ( as do 40 % of coffee drinkers , according to the barista at the store ) . . . light roasts are a little earthier , not as burnt tasting . so i scored a bag each of the willow and veranda . this one , the veranda , didn't do a lot for us . subjectively speaking , it was so smooth it was boring . . . it had no snap , and was kind of mixed and mushy , not a definitive flavor . it's supposed to have " delicate nuances of soft cocoa and lightly toasted nuts " - really ? we missed that . on the other hand , we really liked the willow , which had a brighter citrus - y note and was more flavorful . the taste was ( for lack of better words ) clear , defined . you buy a light roast to taste the bean , not the roast . the willow was flavorful , not acidy , and had a clean finish . your tastes may vary , but if you like a snappy light roast , or a " breakfast roast " the veranda probably won't be your pick , but do try the willow .

dog is way healthier ! we made the switch from iams to this food about 3 yrs ago . we actually did not switch for health reasons for the dog , but instead because i had a crawling infant that was allergic to everything . obviously i don't let my kids eat dog food but i was worried the baby might find a piece , stick it in her mouth , and have an allergic reaction . this food fit the bill as being free of all my daughter's allergens . within a month we noticed a huge change in our dog ! she's a border collie / lab mix and her coat was much healthier looking . her nails used to have a lot of breakage and that stopped . the biggest most important thing that stopped though was her diarrhea . previously i had never considered it could be from her food since she didn't get it every day . however maybe once every 3 - 4 weeks the poor dog would have explosive diarrhea in the middle of the night that would end up all over my walls ( ugh ) . ever since we switched to natural balance 3 yrs ago not one time has she had that problem . she also stopped having ear infections . i know other reviewers have said the formula changed and while we did notice that the kibble looked different it did not affect our dog at all and she's still just as healthy with no problems at all . at one point we tried to switch her to another grain free dog food , taste of the wild , because we couldn't find natural balance in the city we moved to . even though we did a slow transition that food made her really sick , she had horrible disgusting gas , and once again she had diarrhea ( thankfully all outside during the daytime this time ! ) . we went back to natural balance and she was once again her old , healthy , self .

very fair price good price for 2 lbs loose teathe taste is very goodi have had better but not complaining

2 gallons of tabasco , regular and green . for the money i spent on these 2 gallons of tabasco i figured i saved around $ 220 bucks had i purchased the 2 ounce , 5 ounce or 12 ounce bottles from the store , if you use tabasco like me and my family , it is worth it to go big . 
=================
delicious but amazon's $ 64 . 62 price is absurd the goraw company only charges $ 53 . 80 per case . since amazon offers free shipping , the price should be $ 53 . 80 .

they dropped the ball on quality i used to love this coffee , last few shipments it has be sour . i moved on to others ( saxby's guatemala & costa rica are similar to what jeremiah's used to be like )

convenient . . but worth the price ? ? ? on average my wife an i drink 1 - 2 expressos daily and a few months ago bought a delonghi bar32 expresso maker . i purchased this product just to see what all the hype was . it seemed from people i talked with and some reviews that some people really think this is a great tasting product . after going through the 2 boxes i can say it does taste good , but i still prefer fresh ground . it is hard to explain , but these pods had a distinct taste , not like the fresh ground i make or what you would expect at starbucks . the taste isn't bad , just distinctly different , which may be what people that rate it high like . for me i enjoyed the convenience of the pods , but wouldn't regurally pay extra for the taste . 
=================
good but gone i recently experienced this fine product courtesy of the shelves of dollar tree . unfortunately this product has been discontinued by conagra . i would imagine that it was way overpriced and this led to its failure . great taste , ample ingredients , you name it . if only they had priced it right from day one .

loaded with caffeine i have always enjoyed cyrstal light products and so i decided to try the metabolism plus , what a mistake , it is loaded with caffeine , it felt like i was having heart palpitations . word to the wise , read the ingredients before purchasing .

no response to a vital question ! i asked " swanson health products " for an answer to my question : would you be so good as to tell me if the process being use to purify the fructose is the castner - kellner process ( commonly used ) ? their reply : after speaking with several product specialists and a supervisor , we were unable to locate additional information on how the swanson 100 % premium fructose item # sw1083 is processed . now i ask you ; how could they know if it is 100 % pure ? 
=================
peach of an idea this is an interesting new product , a flavoring for bottled water . this is just that a flavoring . do not mistake it for a " kool aid " type item . it provides a suggestion of taste to water . i found it useful with tea , also . 
=================
liked the product the last time but this vendor never sent the pop rocks having ordered pop rocks for a group of students over a year ago , it seemed like a good idea to order the 36 pack for a new group this fall . the order was placed in early august . it is currently september and although i have written amazon for resolution and they responded nicely , the order of pop rocks has yet to arrive . the rocks were needed for a fun way to introduce science lab books to a group of fifth graders . do be careful from whom you order .

amazon listing misleading 20 % off at checkout i purchased a 24 pack of this wonderful product . extra 20 % off galil productssave 5 % when you enter code glilsv20 at checkout . plus , save an additional 15 % when you combine the instant rebate with your subscribe & save order - - bringing your total savings to 20 % . offer valid through december 25 , 2011 . learn more . trying to use this 20 % promo code was totally useless , and once you place an order via amazon buying , just try to find anything helpful , or " contact us " . choices are very limited , " cancel , change address , change payment write a review " once placed they don't want to hear from you to resolve an issue . check it out ! ! 
=================
delicious but . . . a little hiccup i found the granola itself to be very delicious and it is exactly what i wanted . the chocolate element makes it just indulgent enough so i'll be motivated to eat breakfast and not skip it . considering i ordered this " bulk " item , i thought the expiration date would be like 2010 or 2011 . however , it expires in september ! it gives me like two or three months to finish the boxes . i thought that was kind of ridiculous . 
=================
not cheap it is okay but i wouldn't buy again , i'd rather make my own from scratch using fresh frozen fruit .

cheap price , cheap taste this is the second try i've given this particular brand and i still do not like it . maranatha brand almond butter has replaced the store shelf space where other brands that i liked used to be and it is much cheaper at the store - the cheapest - of all almond butters i've seen so far . it's like buying peanut butter - you get what you pay for . i think the problem i have with it is that it doesn't taste like it's made from fresh almonds . it tastes stale or on the verge of being rancid . it could be the oil used or the almonds i have no idea . i just bought it and tasted it without letting it sit around for awhile . i like to spread it on apple slices for a healthy snack . i wanted to like it but after having other brands i loved , i will not ever purchase this brand again . if you are picky about peanut butter then you might be picky about almond butter too . i keep hoping the stores will bring back the other brands to the shelf but right now they aren't giving any choice at the regular ( non - specialty ) supermarkets . my favorite was organic raw almond butter but now that is becoming impossible to find in the supermarkets thanks to maranatha . 
=================
not bad , but i won't reorder thanks for the egg tip , it works very well and really helps this product . nevertheless , i ended up giving away three of the six containers because i was not thrilled with the nutritional information .

reminds me of crystal light this mio liquid peach tea water additive reminds me alot of the crystal light packets that you pour into a water bottle , minius the clumping , harder to dissolve into water issues . i like this small , compact bottle , and the fact that you determine how much or how little you want to add to your water . since so many people do not drink enough water in any given day , anything that will persuade you to drink more water , whether it's adding a slice of lemon or lime , or some kind of additive to your water like this is a good idea . one thing tho , when you first take the plastic off of the bottle , the plastic that prevents product tampering , make sure that you position the bottle over your water bottle or however you drink you water , because it will kind of squirt out . one small bottle is supposed to be enough to flavor up to 24 portions or whatever you want to call it of adding it to your water . i wish it came in a larger size , but maybe it's portable size it so that you can take it with you on the go , to the office or some place like that . for me personally , i enjoyed this peach additive when i have used more of it than less of it , to where you can really see the color in my water bottle , it's not too light or too dark . iam sure it's a personal preference . i do drink alot of water due to the fact that the medication that i take each day does make me thristy , but it's nice to have something to drink besides plain water , tho i do know there are many kinds of waters out there , including flavored ones , but if you buy it in a large quantity , it can be cost prohibitive , not to mention harder to carry and lug around . i like that this mio product comes in a pack of 4 instead of just 1 , but i wonder if they also make a mixed assortment pack , so that you can try different flavors , which would be a good way to keep things interesting , to have variety from day to day . by the way , upon reading the front and back of the bottle , it says on the front of the bottle that it has natural peach flavor , with other natural flavor , and on the back of the bottle it shows zero for everything , but it does contain sucralose , which is instead of sugar . i kind of figured that this product would have some kind of sweetener , which i wish it were sugar , or else this product would taste kind of sour . the comapny who makes mio is kraft foods . lets face it , nothing is going to taste like a peach , a real peach , but a real peach in it's natural state .

last resort i bought this trap as an ultimate resort . for two years our gopher chomped away happily in the garden undisturbed by us . we were ok with him until he started heading for the patio and the pole barn floor and chewing through front garden plantings . i had tried caster oil granules , battery and solar powered noise making devices : even my dogs tried to scare him off . all attempts at deterring his path failed ( including fire ants ) and we finally had to trap him . this device works exactly as described ( we placed a carrot in the ventilation hole to stop him packing it out ) and while we were unhappy to have to use it we can recommend it as a last effort . it would be better if the coyotes did the job for us . be very careful where you put your hands ! 
=================
great brand , yucky flavors i hate to badmouth such a great brand , because we really like earth's best and love getting them with amazon subscribe n save . but honestly , these are gross . i try not to feed sam anything i wouldn't eat , and both of us agreed . . . we won't ever get this selection again . 
=================
still learning how to use these . i bought these beans to try to provide a sample of food that might be available in country for a group of students who were traveling to japan . my first attempt was less than satisfactory and then , sadly , the earthquake and tsunami that occurred in japan cancelled their plans for traveling there . i do plan to try again . i think if i had more experience with cooking any beans i would have been more successful . wish me luck ! ! ! the vendor sent the item ordered quickly , as agreed and certainly did everything they could do to set me up for success . i would order from them again .

just instant coffee just buy a can of instant coffee and stir it into hot water . this is cheaper than the original packages but it does't have coffee . this is not brewed coffee . literally leaves an empty cup after brewing . 
=================
reduced to 99 . 9 cents per cup hopsandmalt , they took your comments to heart and reduced the price to 99 . 9 cents a cup . glad to see we buyers are heard . these prices for k - cups are so ridiculous . i would think starbucks would at least be competitive with other brands .

does this dogfood make your dog pass gas a lot ? i have a chocolate lab who is allergic to chicken so , we are trying this dogfood instead of his usual fish / potato blue basics . he seems to be fine with the dog food since he is not itching and has not had any ear infections . but , he has horrible odd smelling breath and he is very gassy . i am wondering if there is just something in the ingredients that he doesn't tolerate . has anyone else experienced this with their dogs on this dogfood ? 
=================
alright nice company , will answer your emails . this fish is ok . kind of pricey , not that decadent . i'm not sure i would purchase this again . similar to canned tuna in texture and presentation . 
=================
it's a gas our little dog really likes this food , she gobbles it up . however . . . i can't think of a delicate way to say this , so i'm just going to say it . it gave her really bad breath and toxic flatulence . 
=================
no more free shipping eligiblity i am addicted to this product and was so happy that i could get it through amazon at a great price ( $ 19 . 50 ) and it was eligible for free shipping . now the price has gone up almost $ 3 and it is no longer eligible for free shipping because now it is shipped and sold through abc wholesale and not amazon . however the 5 flavor and pepomint flavors are still the lower price and still eligible for free shipping . now i am back to buing this product at target ! 
=================
warning after using this coffee for a month , i can not finish a cup of any other coffee when we eat out , they now taste harsh . if you drink coffee , the depth of flavor and the enticing aroma make you keep coming back for more of this smooth pleasure . i now have it sent automatically . 
=================
will not get this brand again - beechnut is better for bananas beechnut is better than earth's best due to the added ingredients e . b . has in it . i like natural and non - added ingredients .

loaded with additives & preservatives since amazon doesn't list the ingredients , here they are : coconut milk , water , sodium metabisulfite , polysorbate 60 , sodium carboxymethylcellulose , and guar gum . that alone speaks volumes to me . 
=================
absolutely vile i love mincemeat . my grandmother made mincemeat . i make it now myself . this is not mincemeat . this is disgusting . here are the ingredients in crosse & blackwell's " mincement , " in order of volume , according to the label : apples , high fructose corn syrup , corn syrup , raisins , water , vinegar , corn starch , and then trace elements of orange peel , salt , spices , caramel color , orange juice , and preservatives . ( as an aside , what on earth is the purpose of that orange juice , which exists in less quantity than the caramel color . ) in other words , this concoction is apples , drenched in high - fructose corn syrup and regular corn syrup , with a few raisins . lord knows what the " spices " were , because they could scarcely be distinguished under the sickly aftertaste of corn syrup . here are the ingredients from a recipe for real mincemeat , again in order of volume : apples , raisins , beef ( for those who like it ) , sultanas , currents , sour cherries , citrons , sugar , strawberry preserves , apricot preserves , orange peel , lemon peel , spices ( cinnamon , cloves , nutmeg , mace , allspice ) , salt . this mixture is marinated in liquor - rum , brandy , sherry , apple jack , or whatever additional or alternative liquor you may enjoy . our family's recipe calls for these things ; other people use different fruits , most omit the meat , some use juice and vinegar instead of liquor . but the result , in any case , is rich , spicy , complex and delicious . or , if you prefer , you may have crosse & blackwell's canned apples with high - fructose corn syrup . 
=================
too sweet this is way too sweet , i was expecting a kick of sour with the lime , maybe i should have gone with lemon . there is too much sugar in this mix . but this gives a good , strong lime flavor for those who are looking for a lot of lime .

friskies indoor cat treats my cats love these treats and they are getting hard to find in the store . however the price is way too high . i paid over $ 4 for each of these and i can buy them at walmart for $ 2 . 93 when they are in stock . i am very disappointed because i thought i was buying a 10 pak and not a single bottle at that price . i won't buy them again through petco . my cats will have to adjust to something else that is sold at a more reasonable price .

baronet coffee i tried to replace my mellita pods with the baronet coffee pods . it tastes better but the outer covering is too dense . when the highpressure water tries to filter thru the coffee basket , it sometimes spews out the front of the coffe pot . the water could burn someone .

great on popcorn ! try this on popcorn . it is very good ! i bought mine direct from bell plantation . the price here is not right . i give it a four for flavor but take away 2 for costing twice what it should

mild heat combined with too much vinegar . this is a mild hot sauce . that means you can apply it liberally and it's unlikely you will make any dish too hot . so it is user friendly . ingredients ( as copied from the label ) : aged cayenne peppers , distilled vinegar , water , salt - etcwhy 2 stars ? this sauce lacks any character beyond a heavy dose of vinegar . if you happen to like a lot of vinegar in your hot sauce - then you'll love this sauce and my 2 star rating is way off base . i don't like anywhere near this much vinegar . i've blind taste tested over 30 hot sauces and there are many better ones . what is interesting is that the original tabasco sauce has a near identical taste to franks once it is diluted . you will find mention that this sauce was top rated by cooks illustrated . that is absolutely true but what these pundits fail to mention is this was a casual test , done in 2005 , comparing only three hot sauces ! suggestion : since tastes vary and if you happen to like this sauce - then buy it in one of its larger sizes - at least 23 oz and consider the gallon size . they cost little more than the smaller sizes . i'd encourage others to experiment with a sauce that is not so heavily laden with vinegar - you just might prefer it . try any of these : a ) huy fong sriracha hot chili sauce - this sauce has considerable heat but it is nicely balanced against a bit of sweetness combined with a hint of garlic . virtually every supermarket carries it - look in the asian section ! no vinegar . b ) cholula original hot sauce - features a fine blend of peppers - medium hot and readily available - look in the mexican section . it has a hint of vinegar . c ) valentina salsa picante mexican extra hot sauce - a great blend with more vinegar than the above but not too much . another great blend . d ) valentina salsa picante mexican hot sauce - a decent blend but with a lot of vinegar . still it is much better than franks . e ) tapatio hot salsa picanta - another widely distributed and excellent mexican hot sauce . a lot of vinegar but far less than franks . once again you will find this in your mexican isle . in my opinion , all of the above are far superior to franks . if you like franks and are at the least bit curious , you should try any of these other hot sauces
=================
a somewhat healthy juice this is a juice with less than half the calories than most juices ( mainly because of its lack of sugar ) , and less than a third of the sodium of regular v8 . campbell soup accomplishes the latter by dropping the amount of salt added , and compensates by doubling the level of potassium . that's good , in that lower sodium and elevated potassium levels may reduce your chances of heart disease and stroke . it's not so good if your kidney function is marginal . the taste is similar to regular v8 , but less salty . i suspect this is the healthiest juice product out there ( which isn't saying much ) . 
=================
more qestions than answers great bergamot aroma , but unacceptable bitterness . , my question is this real bergamot oil used in the process or just an artificial substitute ? usually when the natural oil is used it states so . this tea only list bergamot " flavor " as the ingredient . this is usually a clever " legal " way of cheating on customers . second , like some others have written , i also noticed a harsh bitter aftertaste when brewed past 5 minutes . thats not very long and one shouldn't have to put a stop watch to a cup of tea ! maybe an artificial bergamot makes it bitter ? i've been searching for a replacement for an old favorite . best earl grey ever was williamson & magor , but sadly the company is no longer solvent after a 100 plus years . they used genuine bergamot " oil " and it was phenominal ! dimah's tin caddy is fantastic and should be an industry standard ! update : taylors of harrogate earl grey leaf tea , loose leaf , is awesome ! ! ! beats this bitter dilmah impostor like a rented mule . taylors of harrogate is even better than my old favorite and uses " real " oil of bergamot . 
=================
do not buy from this seller the product is awesome . i have had super luck with no upset stomachs . i have been feeding solid gold dry and canned for 4 months and am very happy with the product . however , petco is charging a ridicules price for what they are sending . their ads are very deceiving . notice they don't bother to tell you they are selling the smallest can possible . i just paid 1 . 45 a can for the tiny can . you can purchase the large can from pet supply plus for about 128 . 00 . i am so tired of this type of actions going on at amazon . as far as solid gold , i love the product . as far as petco , never again will i buy from them . since i am rating the product and not the seller , i am giving a 5 star . 
=================
smashed , but . . . . . . . . . if they has been whole , and not wet from a ripped packaged , they seemed as if they would have tasted yummy , from the look and smell of them . i received a polite response and a fast refund . if they package these better for shipping , i would try to buy these again .

puts the guilt in " guilty pleasure " without the pleasure i am a sucker for mac & cheese . it's a guilty pleasure . i sneak a bite at every buffet and thanksgiving dinner , even though i know it's for " the kids " and it's bad for my health . when i saw this , the marketing seemed to be aimed at grown - ups , and i thought , " maybe my wife will let me get away with this . " it tasted like chicken covered in ballpark nacho cheese sauce . orzo is a terrible choice for mac & cheese . if you follow the instructions , the orzo becomes overcooked and its texture is so similar to the sauce itself it effectively dissolves . the cheese / starch ratio is too high . it should have been elbow or penne . green dust came out of the broccoli packet . once rehydrated , it looked more like broccoli , but there wasn't enough . i could not taste the broccoli at all . there are few things i won't eat , but i will never eat this again . bottom line : i have a recipe that's nearly as quick and much healthier . i designed it for convenience and speed . for better flavor , saute the chicken separately and add it last . 1 . boil 1 gallon of water . 2 . add 1 box of pasta , 2 chopped raw chicken breasts , some chopped broccoli . 3 . cook until pasta and chicken are done . 4 . drain water from pot . 5 . slowly add 1 package of finely shredded cheese while stirring to melt . 6 . serve immediately . 
=================
much too sweet ! the flakes are the right texture and are crisp . the raisins are chewy and delicious . the fiber is great . however , the sweetness of the brown sugar is extremely overpowering and much too sweet . due to this fact , i probably will not purchase this cereal again . too bad general mills ruined an otherwise good fiber cereal .

betty crocker cake mix very disappointed . we love this cake and can only find the mixes when we visit family in iowa . we were so excited to see we could order on - line . however , we ordered on 6 / 2 / 08 and when cake mixes arrived a few days later they had a " best when used by date " of 06 / 06 / 08 ! ! ! ! imagine having to use 12 mixes in one day ! i hope they keep for a little while . the first one we baked came out fine , so we'll see how the others do .

love at first bite for my girl well , after several different tries at different foods , i finally did some research this morning and decided to try wellness core . i bought the ocean one since my dog ( a 10 year old smooth coat collie ) loves fish . i really think that is why she has always loved to get into the cat's kibble . . . she likes fish ! she has allergies to corn and wheat i think . her skin was always a problem for years . i finally started giving her fish oil and later olive oil on her food . she has never liked any dry kibble i've given her , and i admit i've given her some poor quality foods not knowing it ( beneful , pedigree , nutrish . . . etc . ) well , i went and bought the wellness core this morning , walked in at lunch and she followed me , sniffing the bag ( can she really smell it through that bag ? ) i dumped out the rachael ray nutrish that had been sitting in her bowl since yesterday , and put 1 cup of this wellness core ocean in her bowl . she went right up to it , took one piece out , put it on the floor and ate it . . . took another piece out , put it on the floor and ate it . . and then proceeded to put her head in the bowl and eat it all up ! she then drank some water , went and lay down , and did not bother me while i was eating a turkey sandwich ! wow . i am so hopeful that this food is the answer for her . 
=================
not bad ; not fantastic . . . the flavor wasn't too bad . . . a lot of outside reviews said that the flavor of bael fruit took some getting used to , but these packets were pre - sweetened and the flavor wasn't overpowering . it was a bit difficult to dissolve in cold water , so i would put a little hot water at the bottom to dissolve the powder and then add cold water and ice if you would like it cold instead of hot . 
=================

tastes like perfumed soap i am a daily herbal tea drinker . i prefer green teas , but also love red bush teas . i used to drink fruit teas and even longer ago , i drank black teas before going caffine - free . i never thought i would not like a tea . well , this is the first one that makes me cringe and i wish to never drink it again . unfortunately , i bought 6 boxes here at amazon with many individually wrapped bags , and i don't want to throw my money away , so i will drink all 6 boxes ( i did leave one at a family member's house , just to be rid of a whole box ) . i bought one box of the yogi blueberry slim tea at the store ( one box only to test it first ) and it's quite good . as the title of my review states , this tea tastes like perfumed soap , so i can't recommend this super anti - oxidant flavor . i do love the little tags attached to the bags carrying wise sayings : )

no other martini olive will do once you've had a martini with an ybarra piquillo stuffed olive , no other will do . these olives have a rich , profound flavor - not just the bland , salty flavor ofsupermarket green olives . and the piquillo pimentos really taste of red pepper ( though they're not hot . ) if you choose your gin with care , you should do no less for your olive . justbeware the temptation to snack on these olives by themselves - else you mightfind your martini oliveless !

captain midnight , you lied to me ! i can still remember captain midnight sitting there in the uniform of an astronaut of the 50's ( khaki shirt and black four - in - hand tie ) telling me solemnly that i should drink my ovaltine because it tasted good and it was good for me . it was , after all , brown and that meant it had to be chocolate , my favorite flavor . what the uranus traveler never told me was that they were crystals that would sit at the top of the warm milk and never dissolve . furious stirring with a metal tool called a spoon didn't do it , nor did trying to grind them up against the side of the cup . even using a tenderizer tool didn't work as i soon discovered that as you pushed it down the cup , the warm milk came up and out . you had to compromise by trying to round up the little critters on the spoon and that offered little comfort as the crunchy buggers didn't taste all that great anyway . to top it off , all you had left was warm milk . the jar of ovaltine was also very resilient . it lasted a long time in our home . it was the same one . even my father who liked the " old standbys " of shredded wheat and corn flakes we never ate , didn't go near this stuff . i only recommend this for those who have lost their taste buds through constant sword swallowing or that fire breathing trick . captain midnight , you lied to me !

how sad i love these biscuits a great deal . but they sell for $ 3 . 19 and cost $ 6 . 99 to ship to you ? ? ? no way as they break very easy and thats twice the cost of the initial product . almost makes going to look in cost plus where they sell them for $ 3 . 99 a bargain .

at least as good as coffee mate . we use powdered creamer regularly in our household . typically this meant coffee mate , cremora or occasionally a store brand at the expense of taste . decided to give this one a try recently as i tired of seeing coffee mate everywhere and watching its price increase . community coffee is good coffee so how bad could their creamer bad . well . . . actually pretty good . at least as good as coffee mate , which puts it at the top of the heap for taste . the only thing preventing 5 stars is the presence of hydrogenated oils . unfortunately . . . they all have this and so you really can't avoid it without avoiding coffee creamer altogether . for now at least - i'm making the switch to community coffee creamer .

three dog bakery bitty bites , baked dog treats , assorted flavors , 13 ounces i would say that these treats are average . i like how they use the term " ultra premium quality . " whatever that means ! these treats are very oily and have the consistency of shortbread cookies . very soft and crumbly . yes the dogs love them , but i think i'll get something else next time . 
=================
an acquired taste i did not care for the taste or texture . i was able to get rid of these by sharing them at parties .

tasty , but pricey . but beware the shipping ! i tried these chips looking for a healthy snack and they are quite tasty . the packing / shipping however leaves a lot to be desired . my box came completely smashed up and all the bags are crushed , with only about 1 / 4 of the chips in each bag actually intact . the rest are crumbs and dust . very disappointed in the packaging . there should be a box within a box and some type of protection . . ie packing peanuts .

consistency of stale popcorn balls we love earnest bars ! we use about five boxes a month : four choco peanut butter bars , and one cran lemon zest . i thought i would branch out and try something new . liked the idea of a bigger bar . ordered the pomegranate walnut crisp . i like pomegranate . i like walnuts . i like crispy things . can't lose , right ? wrong ! i don't know if these were exposed to too much moisture or if they are actually supposed to have this consistency , but they are awful ! my title says it all . . . instead of crisp , my bars ( i had two - and ate them on different days - just to make sure the package wasn't faulty and to make sure i wasn't being overcritical ) . the sunflower seeds are nice . the almonds would be better toasted . i don't actually see any walnuts . . . the fruit is flavorful . but the overall taste is just kind of sweet and is lost to the off - putting consistency of chewy popcorn balls . there is nothing crisp about this product . : (

price increase of 66 % in one day ? great product , however , the current price $ 41 . 54 is exorbitant . this product was $ 24 . 95 yesterday . that's a 66 % price increase in one day . what's going on with prices , amazon ?

from " straw " hair to healthy hair " healthy " also deserves quotes , i suppose . same as fingernails or animal horns , as all hair is dead on a cellular level - - unromantic but true . i have " thirsty " ( those quotes , again ! ) hair , and conditioner doesn't always seem to help much . i also have skin sensitivities , so after one manufacturer changed a formula on one of my faves for the worse , i decided to try coconut oil . the results are dramatic . my hair looks really nice , as shiny as it was in my 20s , it's soft again , and i'm feeling kind of like a dupe that i've been buying chemically formulated conditioner all these years . i agree with other reviewers that this oil , or at least the batch i got , seems to have something in it to keep it from solidifying ( at least in a 70something degree bathroom ) the way most culinary coconut oils will . it also doesn't have the same rich coconut flavor of my favorite brands , such as nutiva organic extra virgin coconut oil , 29 - ounce jars ( pack of 2 ) - but then it's filtered , and not extra - virgin . probably for the best , because as nice as coconut is , i really don't want to go around smelling like cheap suntan lotion ! disclaimer : using too much will obviously wreck greasy havoc on some hair , especially finer , lighter , european hair - - which i have , actually . i couldn't have used this at all back in the day when my hair was naturally on the oily side , but if you have coarse , frizzy , wiry , or even just really dry hair , you can probably find the right amount for you to bring back the nice texture and shine without getting overly heavy - - even if that means mixing it in with a bit of gentle shampoo . 
=================
not hot got this hot souce along with the mad - dog 357 hot sauce . this " blair's ultra death sauce " is far from super hot . comparing to the mad - dog , it is like drinking lemonade : - ) . it is a regular hot sauce , perhaps a bit hotter than tabasco sauce . if you want something really hot , get the mad - dog 357 or the mad - dog 357 silver edition , also sold in amazon . that will blow your head off !

meow . i have a cat named charlie who loves this food . i have found that he looks healthier and his coat looks nicer when i feed him iams then with other foods . he also seems to love this food and gets excited when i go in to the kitchen . . . that's his time to show off ( i think ) that he can eat . this comes in a 5 pack and amazon shipped it right away , so no complaints there . edit : march 20 , 2011i can not recommend this food anymore . too many recalls and the ingredients are garbage . i am using chicken soup for the cat lovers soul and my furry friend looks better , lost weight and is more active . to iams . . . you have lost a customer due to your outsourcing and horrible product quality control .

new taste i have been using benecol smart chews for the last 2 years and they have been great for lowering my cholesterol . a great alternative to statin drugs . i was completely dismayed when they were taken off the market a few months ago . i just received my first shipment of the " new " benecol chews . the taste is dreadful ! i will take them but i am very disappointed in the new taste . i guess they reformulated this product . also , they are not available any more by the automatic system at amazon - also a disappointment . 
=================
tastes like diet soda i'm not a huge soda drinker because of the carbs and calories . i don't ever drink traditional diet drinks because i do not like the diet soda taste . i use stevia in the raw at home daily and i have enjoyed the lack of calorie sweetness that it gives me , which lead me to try these sodas . to wrap it up , they have a very strong diet drink taste which is what i was trying to avoid to begin with . if you don't like artificial sweeteners as a concept but don't mind the taste , these drinks may be a more natural alternative for you . dont expect any of the flavors to taste like anything but a diet soda . 
=================
x - cellent instant tea mix compared with arizona's bottled teas , this product is clearly the winner . it tastes fresh , while the arizona pre - mixed tea tastes stale . . . like it sits in warehouses too long prior to being sold . . . which i imagine it does . other instant tea mixes vary from poor to barely acceptable . this mix is " clearly and refreshingly " at the " tea - top ! "

you get what you pay for . this is a large amount of matcha for the money . the catch ? it's not the best quality . seriously . if you're used to a higher quality like domatcha , you will be really disappointed in this . it is quite sour and briny compared . however , it is good 'backup' matcha to have on hand in case you run out of the good stuff .

caveat emptor , dear reader ! i bought the 80 count newmans own because it is the best coffee i have tried in the k cup . period . plus , it is supposed to be organic , and i tust this brand because it is the newman name and hope his daughter is running a tight ship on her parents behalf . however , i was in a hurry when i ordered and did not cross check price or shipping cost ( duh ! as my kids would say ) . i paid twelve dollars more for this item than i would have at costco and then the seller ( potential dynamix llc ) gouged me with a $ [ . . . ] shipping charge . never again . we cannot assume because we are buying something on amazon that we are getting great prices . heck , i knew that . guess i just need to re learn stuff now .

made be a believer dinni's select spicy shrimp sauce , 12 - ounce bottles ( pack of 3 ) bingo ! finally last year i got a gift pack containing 1 jar each of dinni's spicy shrimp sauce , honey mustard and italian herb vinaigrette . all these products made a believer out of me . these is no difference that i could tell in shrimp i cooked with dinni's spicy shrimp sauce and the one i eat at bonefish . amongst the 3 product each one was better than the other . i have ordered several times since then from amazon . there are some products amazon does not carry , which i buy from dinni's website , and always the company includes a free jar as repeat customer appreciation . the free stuff is not mentioned on dinni's site hence i was surprised the first time . every product i have tasted is simply amazing . i don't understand why amazon does not carry all of them . we throw several parties every year . i always wanted to serve the bonefish bang bang shrimp , but it is not practical , so i started searching the web to find a exact recipe , the first one i tried was the one which had lots of good reviews , it called for ; mayonnaise , thai sweet & hot chili sauce . after 3 hours shopping and trying to purchase hard to find ingredients and another hour in the kitchen , the result was very disappointing . the shrimp turned out to be miles apart from bonefish's shrimp . don't get me wrong the shrimp was ok if you are not looking for the bonefish taste , but defiantly it was not a knockoff .

sesame please don't claim to be an allergy friendly product if you ignore the 8th and growing allergen , sesame . how sad that a company would disregard this .

hit & miss seems like a good product and we actually did get a few shitake's from it . . . but not nearly as many as you'd expect . yes , we re - read the instructions and yes , we tried it several times ( 5 times ) with the same results . entertaining for my kids the first time , but after several failures they lost interest and my wife continued to buy shitake's at the grocery store . i am pretty certain we won't do it again .

low fat does not equal low carb when fat is removed from a food , sugar is often added to replace lost flavor . this dressing has 9g of carbs . . . more than regular dressings ! avoid low fat when you're looking for low carb . the seller needs to remove this product from the low carb category . and all the other low fat dressings which are erroneously listed in low carb .

great product - - postage overpriced 3 pack 1 / 2 grain 1000 saccharin tabletsproduct is great and can't be found in my area ( western pa ) . can't believe it should cost as much to ship the product ( package of three plastic bottles ) as the cost of the product itself . shipping and handling is a rip - off . profit margin on shipping must be better than on the product itself . 
=================
just a collection of snacks if you eat everything in the package you will have consumed 18 grams of fat . it includes a huge package of hummus and about 5 crackers ; it's really just a collection of small snacks . it may keep you full briefly but don't count on this to feel like an actual meal . 
=================
delicious ! i decided to give this pack a try , and i was not at all disappointed . be aware that what you get might not be exactly what is actually listed on the product page . when i ordered , the advertised list of products was as follows : zesty cheddar 4 oz . garlic beef summer sausage 5 oz . pepper cheese 4 oz . mesquite beef summer sausage 5 oz . old hickory 4 oz . original beef summer sausage 5 oz . swiss blend 4 oz . but what i really got was : zesty cheddar 4 oz . ( 2x 2oz ) pepper cheese 4 oz . ( 2x 2oz ) old hickory 4 oz . ( 2x 2oz ) swiss blend 4 oz . ( 2x 2oz ) salami beef summer sausage 5 oz . 2x original beef summer sausage 5 oz . 2x mint torte 1 . 25ozthey were also not in a box like pictured but tossed into a nice cardboard box with shaved heavy brown paper . it is really pretty decent packaging for a gift , kind of like a boxed easter basket or something . the taste was amazing . i love summer sausage and cheeses and i loved everything in this box ! i admit i'm not incredibly picky about this type of thing , but i think any sausage and cheese lover would love it . it was all fresh and very good . definitely recommend trying this out , it's a great price for such a product and the only reason i docked a star was because of the somewhat different package contents , and even then i'm not so sure it deserves only 4 stars . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - edit : when i purchased this it was under $ 20 with free shipping . i came back to purchase another one and saw that it was almost $ 35 including shipping . i still think it tasted great , but definitely not worth more than $ 20 with shipping included .

not trackless my husband has a dust allergy , so we tried this out to reduce his sneezing . daily use seemed less dusty than other brands , and it did a decent job at odor control . however , cleaning and refilling the cat's box with this product raised a silica cloud that bothered my lungs . also , our cat tracked it all over the place - - stepping on litter pearls is like stepping on bits of broken safety glass . the cat's box emitted alarmingly loud crunching noises when the cat used it . we've gone back to ordinary clumping . my hubby still sneezes , but on average , lung irritation in the house has gone down . we feel safe walking barefoot again , and the cat is once again a stealthy poo - er . 
=================
shoppers , notice this isn't organic - description wrong this is not wholesome sweeteners organic cane sugar , it's just " natural " , though amazon's description beneath says organic . their website shows their organic cane products in addition to these natural ones . you don't know what chemical pesticides , fertilizers or processing chemicals are used in growth and production . it is " fair trade " certified though , from their site : the fair trade certified logo is wholesome's guarantee that our farmers' cooperatives are paid directly for the cane grown and milled . this means that the farmers can compete with factory farms , cultivate the quality of their crops , send their kids to school and build thriving communities . i did contact amazon but they told me there was no way to check the bag , so i asked if they had a phone number for the company . 
=================
okay , not bad - just not great . the taste of this reminds me of a cross between diet rite and tab . it's just a little bit too much on the sweet side , and a bit flat . i wouldn't buy it again , but it's okay to drink . it's unoffensive .

whoever says this is rubbery or like cartilage did not prepare them right ! ! i heated mine in a skillet , added teriyaki sauce and chicken and it was so good and easy to chew ! ! ! read the directions ! ; 0 )

american beans too sweet years ago i used to buy heinz vegetarian baked beans until one day i bought a tin and wondered why they tasted different . i saw on the tin " new and improved " . i had an old tin and compared the contents . heinz had doubled the sugar content and lowered the fiber . i cannot eat such sweet beans and have been making my own but they are not as good as the british recipe . the british recipe had a fairly high sodium content but i believe they have reduced this , so maybe i will try them again . 
=================
if you like ginger , you will like these that being said , i dont really like ginger that much . i found that out after i bought these . i still eat them because i get queasy every morning for some reason . they work ! oh , helpful tip - - - don't try and chew these bad boys . even though they're called chews , i suck them until they dissolve . i tried to chew them and it just doesn't seem possible .

great taste until the price increase i've been buying the yc chocolate brand for many years ( the milk chocolate with almonds version ) . in 2006 the price was $ 25 . 27 for a box of 10 ( web orders , but not directly from the producer , ycchocolate . com ) . in the past several years i could only buy directly from the producer for $ 29 . 90 ( box of 10 ) plus a free bar for each box ordered . i've been running low lately and when i went to the usual web site , i found they were now selling for $ 40 per box of 8 ! ! today i checked again and the price is now $ 42 for a box of 8 , from ycchocolate and from amazon . needless to say , they have lost me as a regular customer . the chocolate is among the best " no sugar added " chocolates ( it's as good as regular chocolate ) , i would recommend them to anyone . but with a price increase of 78 % , no way .

dog likes treat - company unresponsive to requests for information while my dog really likes the treats from this company the company is unresponsive to requests related to their manufacturing in china . my dvm has concerns about the processing of these treats because of their origins in china and how they may not be as healthy as presented ; however , i have been unable to get some solid info from the company other than " check out our website for information " .

was a great coffee for the price until recently i bought this espresso bean for use with my rocket giotto ii premium plus espresso maker , and my macap m4 grinder . my name is toca , and i'm an espresso fiend . while i like this coffee and agree with a previous reviewer that it's a " standard bearer " in my house , now they've priced it such that i'm more inclined to buy my espresso beans locally . i previously used " subscribe and save " to get the price at less than a twenty spot per bag . i'll return to them when their prices return to where they were in april or i get tired of the local stuff . it's really too bad because i love this coffee . and there may be very good reasons for the price increase , but i'm more inclined to get adventurous with my source of coffee beans than take a 27 % price hike in the shorts . if anyone can suggest a good light roast espresso bean in the northern italian style , i'm all ears ! edit : it looks like all coffee prices are going up , so there is a good reason for the price increase . this is the sound of me begrudgingly admitting i was wrong . . . gah ! 
=================
deceitful brand name if you are looking for an actual organic dog food , newman's own is not the way to go . i accidently purchased this thinking it was what it claimed on the front package , only to read the ingredient list to find out that basically everything else but the chicken was organic . with all of the drugs and hormones fed to conventionally raised " food animals " this ingredient is the most important one that should be organic . 
=================
freezer works better this product is a waste of time . i have been getting far better results freezing my own poop using my ordinairy under counter freezer ! why would you wait for the dog to go ? pointless ! 
=================
flavor doesn't last very long , but this is still the best sugar - free gum i've found ( so far ) i'll agree with another reviewer here that flavor longevity could be improved , but i also have to say that i don't see trident as a viable , sugar - free gum alternative at this time . many gum - makers are starting to embrace the benefits of xylitol and incorporate the ingredient into their product lines , but most of them ( trident included ) supplement the sweetener with either sucralose ( splenda ) or aspartame ( nutrasweet , equal ) , both of which are toxic and are responsible for many ill side - effects . sucralose is basically chlorinated sugar , chlorine being , basically , bleach . not something one would want to ingest into one's body . aspartame has been on the market longer , and its effects have been well - documented over the years . it contains neurotoxins , including methanol ( which also occurs naturally in fruits along with ethanol and pectin , which greatly slow down its metabolization , greatly decreasing its potency ) that your body metabolizes directly to formaldehyde . among other things , aspartame has been known to cause extreme fatigue , depression , severe headaches , skin diseases , severe muscle weakness , vomiting , bells palsy , and even death ( including among healthy athletes who drink a lot of diet sodas and use energy powders like metrx , both of which include aspartame ) . google " aspartame poisoning " and / or " sucralose poisoning " for more info . so , until someone is able to point out a better tasting xylitol - sweetened gum that includes neither aspartame or sucralose , i'll be buying xylichew .

now i like it ! bought a bag as a small celebration after passing an exam . brewed it in my aeropress and was rather disapointed . brewed another cup today emulating the clover by performing the " upsidedown " version of making coffee in the aeropress and letting it steep for about a minute and a half . delicious cup of coffee ! 4 stars due to the high cost of the beans . 
=================
tastes like . . . if you love super dark , rich , bold and thick flavored coffee then this is the coffee for you . . . with one problem . personally i love coffee that embodies everything i just said . i love esspresso and the like . to find a k - cup that is this bold even on the 10 oz . setting is great . . . but there is that problem again . . . it smells , tastes , and leaves the after taste of burnt urine ! like someone torched a public restroom and mopped the floor with coffee , then packaged it . yum ! there are other dark , bold k - cups out there that have a better smell , flavor and does not have a nasty after taste . you may not believe me , and that is fine , but get a sample pack before going for the 24 , you'll thank me later . try the green mountain coffee extra bold sumatran reserve k - cups . better all around cup of coffee . 
=================
fishy fish oil these taste and smell very much like fish . my son tried one and told me it was like eating the ocean . ( we live near the ocean ) i tried one as well and they are very very fishy . i understand they are omega - 3 fish oil , but the omega - 3 orange packets i take taste like orange cream soda . we only bought these because he loves gummy anything and i thought he'd be more likely to take them . nope . i'm sure they work great , but just be aware that they are very fishy and kids might not want to take them . 
=================
extra strong coffee this coffee hits you like a sledge - hammer . i do not recommend this coffee to those with high blood pressure . the coffee tastes smooth . it goes down well . but within 10 minutes , you will feel a kick unlike any coffee you've tasted . what's more , the kick remains for a long time . that's good if you like that . not so good if you are looking for a gentle pick - up . after drinking this coffee , i decided to work - out and i became nauseated and sick . i don't have such problem with any other coffee . i do not recommend rigorous physical activity after drinking this coffee . this is a terrific high quality coffee if you are looking for the strongest caffeine kick possible . maybe not as good if you are looking for a gentler blend . 
=================
i ordered and was charged for four bottles and only received three great product . but only recevied three and not the four i ordered and paid for . not sure how t contact anyone about this ! box that i received product in could only fit three , but no other box arrived . whom should i contact ? annoyed . these were intended gifts . ruth gass

product = good . seller = meh . i ordered this for my son's birthday cake . it was adorable , and i got lots of compliments . . . i put it on a plain white 8 " round cake i ordered and it was easy to put on , though not as flat as i would have liked . be careful that your cake is very flat . i will say , though , that well into the " expected delivery " window the product hadn't shipped , and i emailed the seller to cancel the order . miraculously , i was informed by the seller ( but not by amazon ) that it had already shipped and was too late to cancel . it did end up arriving a couple days later , but it took over a week from the time i ordered it until it actually shipped . i was frustrated with the experience .

won't use anything else my dogs have been on wellness for about four months now . i have a 10 year old lab / border collie , a 2 year old pug / beagle , and a 1 year old aussie / boxer / beagle and they all love it ! their coats are soft and shiny as can be - - - i won't feed anything else ! 
=================
delicious ! these are more salty than they are spicy . on the outside , it's a toned down version of the mango flavored mexican lollypops . on the inside , it's tastes quite sweet but does not taste anything like strawberries . over all , the mango flavored one is still a little better but if you're deciding between this or the watermelon one , get this bag instead ! the watermelon one tasted gross . 
=================
nabisco premium salteines i have been shopping for nabisco premium saltines and have found them on the shelves but are not the original as the box claims every box that i find proclaims them to be original but stamped on the box it indicates that they are with sea salt ( not original ) . i would like to know if they are still made with salt containing iodine which is a required ingredient for a healthy diet . dietations have indicated that the american ( united states of america ) diet is iodine deficient , therefore , the crackers with sea salt is less healthy for us . where can i find them with iodized salt if they are still made . if they are no longer available shame on you for producing a less healthy food product . 
=================
putting pure coconut oil in a plastic container ? ? ? this is awesome coconut oil , but it is packaged in a plastic container . plastic can leech into the product . what is the point of putting a health food in contaminating packaging ? change it ! glass is far more acceptable , and will not will not contaminate the product with the estrogens from plastic . we people who use coconut oil will definitely recycle it , like we do everything else . ; )

if you like this coffee that's fine and good . i didn't . if you like this coffee that's fine and good . i didn't . pumpkin spice limited edition on the box it states " a delicious coffee enhanced by the creamy pumpkin spice flavors of autumn . " " where's the pumpkin " " where's the creamy " " where's the spice flavors of autumn " all i found was a very weak , cup of " coffee " ? ? i tried 8oz then 6oz . it wasn't a good cup of coffee . my wife didn't like it at all eitheri tried cream , . . . . . sugar , . . . . . and cream and sugar . i love most of my k cups and some not so much , but this one not at alli had pumpkin spice at hyatt place in hendersonville , tn and wow it was so good , so i order this thinking , just a little like hyatt would be great . the closest it came to hyatt's was hyatt's water fountainif gmc feels that i may have got a bad box - i would try a sample cup of what they feel is a good one . i love amazon just not this item

took it for 9 months my wife and i took juice plus for 9 months , we saw no changes to the requirements for our drug medications despite claims from the company that we would require significantly lower dosages , our colds came as they had always come and it cost more than most over the counter suppliments .

holy price hike , batman ! ! we purchased this coffee with subscribe & save and were thrilled with it . perfect flavor , mellow , and of course , a reasonable price . and i was about to order more until i saw the ridiculous price hike . did you really think people would keep ordering it with that kind of an increase ? buh bye !

need wider i remember wide flat noodles made by mueller's years ago . can't figure out why they're not longer available . hoped these would fill the bill but they do not . the flavor and quality is okay but i would prefer a much wider noodle . they also require such a large order that i am overloaded with bags of noodles ! can't really recommend it . 
=================
not the colors listed . . . . i ordered this because the description indicated that avocado and copper were included but they were not . instead i received teal and fuschia . the other colors were included as advertised and it would be too much trouble to return so i will just get the other colors at a local cake supplies . would have been happier if i had gotten what i expected . . .

supply shortage so product coming from sri lanka not thailand i love their product from thailand . i don't like the product from sri lanka . the content of coconut oil is higher in sri lanka made coco milk , throwing off the consistency . i don't want to have to warm the coconut oil prior to using in a cold smoothie , it will just chunk up anyway . wrote the manufacturer - here's the replyfrom the manufacturer : thank you for writing . due to worldwide surging demand for coconutmilk during its lean harvest season , our primary organic packer inthailand is unable to keep up with our volume of sales . therefore wehave added a trusted organic coconut facility in sri lanka as oursecondary supplier . unfortunately , sri lanka uses a slightly differentprocessing method than thailand does and the sri lankan product hasmore tendency to separate when its temperature falls below 80 degreesf . this makes the milk appear curdled as the coconut fat separatesfrom the liquid . such separation is harmless and easily remedied byplacing the can of coconut milk in hot water for 15 minutes and thenstirring the contents thoroughly . we regret this inconvenience , especially since consumers have come to really value the smoother , creamier consistency of our native forest organic coconut milk . whileall natural and organic coconut milk will separate in cooltemperatures , the thailand milk is more smooth and homogeneous . facedwith lengthy stock shortages during an exceptionally lean coconutseason , we decided to accept the different coconut milk consistenciesfrom two supply lines rather than have no organic coconut milk at allduring this six month lean period . we are only shipping thai sourcedcoconut milkas of right now , but distributors and stores may still have sri lankansourced product . thank you for your patience and your understanding . sincerely , joanna freetedward & sons trading co . , inc .

great oil , poor packaging wonderful oil . some supermarket brands have a burnt smell / taste ; not so with this one . la tourangelle has everything you like about sesame oil with nothing you don't . amazon's packaging of this oil is the worst of any item i've ever ordered in the last five years . i ordered 3 cans of sesame oil and 4 cans of grapeseed oil , and they were all in a box loose with 4 air packages which didn't nearly fill up the box . all cans arrived dented . the oil is great , the prices are good , and if you don't mind dented cans , go ahead and buy it . if you do not like deliberately mis - packaged items and dented cans , fughedaboudit . this would have been rated 5 stars were it not for the dented cans . 
=================
pocky is good but . . best to check out your local asian food market or japanse anime store . the price will usually be better , considering s & h , and you won't be stuck with 6x of something you end up hating . also there are a lot of other varieties of pocky than what's being sold here . there's even " giant " pocky , " custard " pocky , " green tea " etc . . . always more new ones coming out . but , if there are no market or if other internet stores are comparable in price , than maybe a wise choice for the curious snacker . beware though , even i didn't like the sesame . and fyi , men's pocky is just " bitter " instead of " milk " chocolate . best flavors in my opinion ( and most novice pocky snackers like ) : men's , strawberry with / without extra bits , almond crush .

very salty this is more like seasoned salt than " creole . " we have it at local dollar stores where i like and they can't give it away there .

starbucks could have done better ! ! it is definitely coffee with caffeine . . taste like vanilla mixed with coffee but not as strong as vanilla syrup or anything . . i honestly don't like this coffee , which is personal taste . the coffee is well ground , and the smell of it brewing is very nice , but not the taste of it ! 
=================
taste good but much higher in sodium than mainstream brands i thought i was getting a healthy alternative to cheese its and cheese nips . but after comparing the labels , i was surprised to see that the back to nature ones have basically the same ingredients ( nothing organic ) and much more sodium than the major brands . seems they just put regular crackers in a 'healthy' looking box and got away with charging a premium .

bearable taste / decent taste , good for active people when i first bought this product , i figured it wouldn't taste anywhere near most whey proteins , for this is half true . this hemp powder sure has an earthy taste with a dirt like texture . being the non - wasteful person i am , i kept using it and i found mixing it with a milk ( cow , almond , oat . . ) and a fruit such as a banana does wonders for the flavor and a hint of vanilla extract makes it taste good too ! i workout hard every day and i must say it's been helping me to achieve better results and and bigger muscles ! your body can actually use every gram to it's advantage unlike whey where you have to drink tens and tens of grams to recover from a tough workout . do the math = processed whey powder = 50 % usable by the body ( 75g ) or hemp powder = 100 % usable ( only 15 - 30g ! ) . i go natural with weight lifting because cutting corners will show on your body when you get older . in all honesty , if you are a person that is picky with taste or flavors , you might only be able to hack this by masking the flavor with a bunch of other products . it ain't the most exciting flavor , but after a while , you get used to it and it's very easy on my stomach . from seeing some results using this , i'm definitely gonna continue using this product !

if the rope breaks , it can be salvaged ! i purchased this product hoping that the " bullet proof like material " would last longer than the other toys i'd purchased for my 8 month old lab . he's a chewer , and within an hour had the rubber - rope gnawed in two . but someone posted a photo of the modification they made post - rope that saved the day : inserting a tennis ball into the bottle . amazing idea ! whom ever came up with that should write the company and suggest the modification . he can't get through the bottle , and the ball blocks the hole enough to where he really has to try to get the treat out . it is loud , but this is the first toy to survive my lab . if it's lab proof , i'm sure it can survive anything !

think thin products are great unless they are shipped from all star health and then they are spoiled think thin products are great unless they are shipped from all star health and then they are spoiled . be very careful when buying think thin bars from amazon . i bought some bars . they made me sick . amazon and all star health did nothing about it .

poor documentation , is this really raw pure honey ? from the recent reviews mine will not be popular . 1 . this honey is incredibly expensive for a very small amount , even less than noted in the ad . 2 . i buy unfiltered , unheated , unprocesseed raw honey from many countries and areas all must be without proximity to flowers with pesticides and or abominations . this honey states ( if you can wade through the umf stuff , in very small print , that it is filtered to remove particles . i want the pieces of comb , i want the pieces of pollen , i want the natural particles that came from the comb to the jar - the pure enzymes etc . further , this honey is heated albeit limited according to the fine print . 3 . the material in the four page pamphlet is very limited focusing on the umf + 20 designation which is supposedly very important . the first page is just pictures and the name of the honey and company . the second page is white small print on a pale yellow background which makes for very difficult reading . i like that the honey comes from isolate protected trees far from any farming and contaminants . the third and fourth pages are more on this umf + 20 stuff . 5 . taste - the honey , if you are new to it , has very distinctive flavor because of the unique tree from which the honey is collected . it has a slight off ( a hint of bitterness maybe ) flavor . i liked it . overall you get limited clear information on how they process the honey , and the cost is outragous compared to many other raw , unfiltered , unheated , unprocessed comb to jar honey where you get four or more times as much at a fraction of the cost with most if not all the same health healing benefits . also , the brochures talks about the lack of peroxcides . i have never heard of this before and question what it means in a practical sense . i will not buy again . 
=================
great quality ; not a good item shipped ? i really enjoy using this product in cooking ( popcorn , pancakes , etc ) but both shipments i have received have leaked a little . it was strange because the product seemed sealed ( i did not find any evidence that it had been opened ) , but there were clear oil drippings that seeped through the packaging . it was definately coconut oil , as i could tell from the scent . i will no longer get this item shipped . instead i will buy some at a store .

guacamole lover if you want a quick easy way to make perfect guacamole then this is the product . it arrived very promply and nothing broken .

feline enzymatic chews my only complaint about this product is that the chews should be a little smaller for cats . i have to cut them up or my cats won't eat them . 
=================
so good i'm not sure why people here review this brand and flavor so poorly here . a good part of me thinks it's because they're so used to the chemical taste and artificial flavorings of the big brands ( msg laden jerkys , or loaded with flavorings and preservatives ) . anyway , back to the jerky . . . i work out , run , and teach cardio kickbox classes weekly and without lots of serious , natural protein , i will feel it within a few days . without exception , every other brand of jerky i've tried either uses msg or contains so many preservatives i feel sick after eating enough to fit my needs . stay away from world kitchens - - tasty but msg loaded . so if you're eating real amounts of jerky , give any of the golden valley jerky products a spin for a few weeks and you'll feel a night and day difference . also check out my other review for more .

pack of 6 i must've missed where it said that these nonpareils came in a pack of six . this is way more than i wanted , but i guess you do get a lot for what you pay for . arrived promptly , no complaints about the product .

doesn't taste artificial or sugary , but a natural sweet i love licorice . i'm not a huge fan of those neon - colored rainbow packs with funky flavors , so i tried not to be skeptical about the idea of pomegranate licorice . i'm also not a huge organic food person , though i do try to be as natural and healthy as i can pull off . what i got was a cute package of roughly 4 . 5 " licorice sticks . opening the package , i was immediately struck by a delightful aroma that smelled fruity and real , not sugary sweet . grabbing a piece , i was expecting a texture like twizzler , but found one more like nibs . it isn't sticky , nor is it a challenge to bite through . flavor - - it doesn't taste artificial or sugary , but just a natural sweet . i like it . with a candy , i wouldn't normally get into ingredients , but since this is organic , i thought i'd comment . first , i can pronounce everything on the list , with the most difficult one being vegetable glycerin . corn syrup is on the list , along with organic sugar . overall , i like this . i cannot imagine this will become a regular purchase , but i don't buy much candy . 
=================
switched to this food because it has no byproducts i didn't realize byproducts were actually pieces of anything off the floor , including chicken feet and beaks . i have a 4lb chihuahua , and a now 9lb chihuahua mix , who was 5 lbs when i got him from a rescue 2 years ago . they really like this food , though my vet said it's high in fat . i think she was implying that's why the one dog weighs so much now , but he was skinny when i got him lol . of course it's about 3x more than the food i used to buy at the grocery store , but if i have to pay more to feed my dogs better , in the hopes that they live as long as they can , i'm willing to do that . this food also comes in lamb flavor and a small breed formula . my dogs liked the lamb , and then i switched them to the toy breed , thinking it may be less fattening . when this current case of toy breed is gone , i'm switching back to lamb .

cost in london just was in london , a package of these biscuits is 89 pence . i know it costs a lot to ship , and my trip more than makes up for the difference in price , but it still was . . . . . . . . disappointing . 
=================
cold pressed hot delivery i wouldn't recommend buying this item online if in hot climates because though it may be cold pressed , it travels in te heat to get to you . 
=================
expensive ! ! ! the coffee is wonderful but the price at amazon is way too high . the price is lower at whole foods which has high prices !

no longer available ? ? ? what idiot ( s ) at sara lee ( whereever ) decided to no longer sell the pods in regular grocery stores ? ? ? ? ? i was told the stupid decision was made in march . a pox on u .

good on the pinch , strange on the taste buds this cornbread mix is very easy to make ( just add water ) and i can appreciate that . flavor is mild corn , kinda gritty texture , and has a strange aftertaste . i bought mine from the grocery store , but i won't get it again . 
=================
good but subjectively not 5 star i realize that taste is a matter of personal preference so food reviews are always going to be hit or miss for your tastes . got the cookies , liked them but they didn't quite send me the way other folks seem to take to them . not bad and i don't feel i wasted my money but i'll probably look for something else next time i'm ordering snacks for work .

depends upon your use of them after watching a dr . oz special which lauded the digestive effects of caraway seeds , i ran to my computer to order some immediately . the idea that ingesting a half a handful of seeds would cure me of excessive gas and bloat had me excited beyond words , until i received them in the mail and shoved them in my mouth . . . word to the wise , do not eat caraway seeds by the handful - you may choke to death , but even worse , you may not . picture a day at the farm , walking through the stables . . . now picture picking up some straw and shoving it into your mouth . . . that would be preferable to chewing craway seeds . the best parallel to eating caraway seeds would be if you went to woodshop , picked up the carvings , mixed it with dirt and pepper and chewed . now that doesn't mean that you shouldn't buy them , but be aware they need to be an ingredient . . . like if you want to bake your own rye , although , that seems foolhardy since rye bread is cheap .

it's all bs class litigation should be illegal . maybe there was a time and place , but these days it's designed to just make lawyers richer . it has nothing to do with product safety . the people claiming to have had the dressing tested , by labs no less , did they mention if they used " fda approved labs or testing methods ? " no , didn't think so . this is a california bunch doing this , you know , the land of litigation . this is a prime reason why businesses and people are leaving the state in droves . this practice is dishonest and should be outlawed , but in a state owned and operated by liberals , well . . . good luck . personally , i have to get out of here . i am too damned honest to be a californian .

tastes great , but use care when preparing this is the first time i've tried a microwaveable pasta product , and i found it to be quite good . the sauce was indeed spicy ( i love spicy ) and the flavor , while not quite as good as something you'd buy in a jar , was better than i expected . i liked the pasta , too . this isn't something i'd have regularly at home ( i'd prefer to just cook pasta ) but wouldn't mind eating regularly at work or some other place . i can see myself stocking up on a few . however , use extreme care when preparing . i followed the preparation instructions on the package and managed to give myself a first - degree burn . one side of the tray contains a removable sauce cup , the other the pasta . the idea is to peel back the cover a tad ( for ventilation ) , microwave the food , then peel back the cover from the sauce cup and tray and dump the sauce on the pasta . since the cover is stuck on the sauce cup there is a place to hold the sauce cup with your thumb while removing the cover . unfortunately , the cover adheres very well to the sauce cup . when trying to remove the cover my thumb slipped and hot pasta sauce dumped all over my right hand , resulting in a burn . next time i think i'll peel back the cover to expose the sauce cup completely , and then put the cover back down and hold it in place with a small microwave - safe bowl while microwaving .

grab and go items for breakfast i bought these to have grab and go items for breakfast . it dies taste good and like cookie dough , the downfall that it isn't very healthy . they did come fast and packaged well as it was left on my porch and snowed ! i would recommend these are they are good on the go and don't leave too much of a mess with crumbs ! 
=================
terrible flavors , but good variety we received a sodastream for christmas this year . i bought this variety pack so i could sample the various flavors without having to invest in a large bottle of each . i'm grateful that i bought this variety pack or my house would now be full of large bottles of disgusting flavored syrup . there are 6 regular flavors and 6 diet flavors . the flavor selection is good . we were so excited to try them . for us , the only flavor that was drinkable was the lemon - lime , which really did taste almost as good as name brand 7 - up . the orange and root beer flavors were disgusting . all of them , except the lemon - lime , left a terrible aftertaste in my mouth . still , this kit was nicely packaged and the kids did have a lot of fun trying out the different flavors . i just wish they would have tasted better ! 
=================
not to bad i thought the item was bigger . my fault for not reading description . i got the item in good time . one of the coins is broken but not to bad . i would recomend seller to a friend .

weight gain ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! looking to gain weight ? i wasn't . my favorite smoothie to order is the pb and strawberry , but they use this product . after 2 smoothies 2x week for two weeks , that's what 4 cups total . my weight has gone up ! i'm a size 4 , 5'6 , 119 lbs . i'm a fitness , health freak , so when my weight goes up , something is wrong ! what is it , then ? soy . anytime i have eaten soy , my tush , thighs , and hips grow rapidly . soy is a phytoestrogen , a plant estrogen . women , like me , will put on pounds ( around the ovaries : hips , thighs , tush ) when consumed . clifbars are a no no for me , too . this 'magic' low - cal low - fat 'peanut butter' is half soy ! i am taking my organic pb to the smoothie shop , so i can have the real deal . the fat in the peanut is good unsaturated fats , why would you want less ? also , a tip . if you would like to feel great , and lose weight fast , try eating according to blood type ! i went from 132 to 119 in two weeks ! google it ! ciao ! 
=================
absolutely odor - free since i first used this product , i won't use any other brand . it seems my local pet and grocery stores can't keep it in stock , so i just order it every month through amazon . this product doesn't try to mask catbox odors with equally bad floral odors . instead , the real green tea used in this product seems to absorb the bad odors , leaving no odor at all . what a relief . 
=================
my cat still had lactose problems with this milk . my cat loves milk , but because of the side effects quit cat milk . it just depends on your cat . some cats really can't handle milk products . my cat doesn't touch this anymore .

=================
it's tasty , but crystal light flavors are almost all awful , but this one tastes ok . i don't notice the aftertaste most others mention , very much . it does have a number of ingredients that are bad for you . there's a failing grade for a typical crystal light product on another site because of these dubious chems - foodfacts dot com . and be warned about this chem - drink : if you fill one dixie cup with water , and another dixie cup with crystal light mojito drink , and leave them for 24 hours , the water will be contained in the morning , but the crystal light will have begun to eat through the glue of the same cup , and begun leaking . and . . . when that stain dries , it leaves a green flaky residue . not very cool or appetizing .

made my baby gag ! my 7 - month old son was recently diagnosed ( through blood tests ) with a milk allergy . he's had bad cradle cap and eczema on his face since he was about two months old . after trying many other formulas ( enfamil , good start gentle plus , good start soy , similac advance , baby's only soy ) , the doctor finally suggested going hypoallergenic . so we tried nutramigen . . . he seemed okay for the first couple of minutes , then he pulled the bottle out of his mouth and gagged . i tried again . . . and again , he drank for a minute or two , then gagged again . then he refused to drink any more . after reading up on hypo formulas i was expecting a bad smell , but i didn't think it'd be bad enough to make my son want to hurl ! my son never had any problems drinking all of the other formulas ; this is the only one that actually made him gag . maybe if i had started it earlier when his tastebuds were more immature , i would've had more success . i'm hesitant to give him the alimentum because of the high sugar content . i guess my son will just have to continue suffering with rashes until i can find a formula that works for him . : (

not handed out yet but so excited to do so these are yet to be used and handed out . bought them for my sons toy story themed b - day party coming up and i cant wait to hand them out !

too many mediocre ginger ale / beers have jumped on bandwagon this is another example of a mediocre at best ginger ale dressed up with fancy packaging at a ridiculous price while not even coming close the complexity or intensity of many of the better ginger beers . unfortunately , amazon places you in a paradox in buying some of the better ones . the top two aren't carried by amazon at all but amazon does carry some decent ones . aside from the two that are 5 star and will go unnamed as they are already too difficult to get and sticking w / those that have free shipping since w / o free shipping , you are likely to pay well more for the s / h than the actual product . loathe that i am to admit it , bruce cost's is pretty good - not nearly as good as it should be given the alternatives and he screws some them up with flavoring , which ; to my mind is like taking peet's french roast and trying to get a hazelnut / vanilla flavor to it . but he fancies himself the guru of all things asian ( as far as i know , he is the only one who shares that opinion ) and the rhizome ginger is asian so he makes a 12 pack and charges $ 50 for it . all of the british ginger ale is no better than canada dry ( who used absolutely no ginger in its ginger ale until the past couple of years ) so skip the fever tree . bermuda ginger beer is frequently very good and amazon has had a few . i believe regatta is from bermuda but as a form of torture with which tantalus would be familiar , amazon generally offers the diet with free shipping and the stuff that tastes good with exorbitant shipping . blenheim is a marketing campaign , they know that many of the better ginger beers are spicy so they make a spectrum of spicy gbs , but they are one dimensional , heat only . two of the better known brands , reed's and boylan's don't appeal to me . when they were the only premium gbs on the market , i drank them but i don't think either makes the top ten anymore . two good ones in bottles that amazon carries w / o s / h are saranac & eli's , neither are cheap but it's delivered to your door and includes what we in ca have to pay as crv and s / h are generally free . now for the best deals amazon offers . bottles are expensive to ship so that cost will , to some extent at least , be built in somewhere . in some cases it's worth it . the two best bottled gbs that amazon carries that are usually free s / h are 1 ) a j stephen's ( sp ? ) and 2 ) cock & bull which , urban legend has it as being brewed specifically for the brown derby restaurant , an la icon and is called for by name in a cocktail named the moscow mule . can's are significantly cheaper to ship and i have 3 recommendations for them . i keep a variety of strengths of ginger juice , grated fresh ginger , & ginger syrup so i can sometimes salvage a gb that is a little too bland . that is the case with santa cruz organic gb , it's almost good ( by which i mean far better than schwepps or canada dry but not top tier . if you have some ginger extracts around you can get it pretty good . occasionally , amazon will have the ginger people's product with free shipping . that's definitely worth a look as it has pieces of ginger still floating in it . the single best deal on amazon , in my estimation , is barr's . it's canned so you can get a reasonably priced 24 pack , usually with free s / h . the problem is that amazon is more often sold out than not . i probably wouldn't have mentioned it if i didn't already have 3 cases en route to my house . i haven't seen it often enough to get around to studying it's heritage but it's the best tasting canned ginger beer i've ever had - and at a great price . i think the single best deal for consuming on a daily basis is vernors . i occasionally can find it on sale at $ 2 . 99 a six pack . i don't think i've ever seen a great deal on amazon but if they offered free shipping on vernors , i'd probably get a couple cases a month . it's a little sweet and not really gingery / pungent as the best but can be a great deal . i confess to knowing not very much about jamaican gb . i've tried idris and it's pretty good . most of the jamaican stuff on amazon seems to be in 64 oz . 1 / 2 gallons , plastic and i'm not too fond of that . well that my not very humble opinion . i'm going to have a 12 oz . bottle of my favorite . i'm not going to share the name online but if i get an email ( besides hate mail ) i'll tell you . of course i may be the only one in this country this fanatical about a soft drink so i won't expect an overflowing in box . do yourself a favor , though , skip canada dry - unless you need a mixer or have a sick kid . 
=================
missing coffee i'd like to be able to review this product - however , san francisco coffee did not include it in my shipment . although noted on the invoice , along with the french roast ordered , they sent two boxes of french roast and did not correct the shipment when notified . therefore , one star it is ! btw - the french roast is a 4 star . 
=================
good flavor these don't taste like oreos at all . they have a single oreo cookie , on top of that is the creamy peautbutter and then they are covered in a fudge type covering . the peanut butter over - shadows the other flavors , i can't really taste the chocolate or the oreo . while these are good , it is not something i would buy often , they just aren't habit forming like some cookies are . they are almost too sweet . i think they would be better with w reeces type of peanut butter instead of the creamy . don't buy a lot of these until you try them . we got tired of them before the package was empty . 
=================
great chocolate , not so great marzipanthis this candy had a great chocolate covering but the marzipan was lacking in texture ( too runny ) and flavor . it could be it was overpowered by the chocolate since the almond scent and flavor is fairly delicate . it came simply but beautifully wrapped and the candy was very attractive to look at . if you want true marzipan flavor , go somewhere else . 
=================
i will urge my local store to stop carrying this i think there is no such thing as a " good " or " bad " food . however , i believe there are foods that i would choose to eat again and those i would not . this is the latter . russian prison food i know not , nor dickensian gruel , but the food served by the 3rd infantry division during the mid - 70's nadir of its morale on snowy evening german logging roads is fondly remembered compared to this . and i'm afraid , like another early reviewer said , its smell reminded me of pet food .

good meal ( not vegan though ) its a decent vegetarian meal . i gave it one star only because it has dairy and i am looking for vegan foods . it tasted okay .

a total scam i am thorougly disgusted with betty crocker for this product ( gluten - free bisquick ) , which is a shame , because i do applaud them for their excellent cake , cookie , and brownie mixes . i'm not upset with them for for coming out with a gluten - free baking mix , but for : # 1 ) marketing it as though it's an equivalent to bisquick and # 2 ) for pricing it so ridiculously high . ingredients for regular bisquick : enriched flour , partiallly hydrogenated soybean and / or cottonseed oil , leavening , dextrose , salt . ingredients for gluten - free bisquick : rice flour , sugar , leavening ( baking soda , sodium aluminum phosphate , monocalcium phosphate ) , modified potato starch , salt , xanthan gumnotice anything missing from the ingredients of gluten - free bisquick ? yup , that's right - - there's no shortening ( or oil ) . that was the whole point of the original bisquick - - a baking mix that already had the shortening mixed in . that avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits that is why people buy baking mixes - - for that specific convenience . betty crocker has decided to leave out the shortening ( or oil ) altogether , even though shortening ( or oil ) is always naturally gluten - free . so they can't pretend it's a safety - for - celiacs factor . it's a cost - savings to them , pure and simple . here's the breakdown of what you're paying $ 5 a pound for : rice flour ( 99 cents a pound at my local asian store ) , sugar ( $ 2 . 88 for a 5 pound bag at walmart ) , potato starch ( also 99 cents a pound at the asian store ) , baking powder ( $ 3 . 19 a pound at emergency essentials ) , salt ( $ 2 for 26 ounces of morton's ) , xanthan gum ( $ 10 . 45 for 4 ounce on amazon ) . yes , xanthan gum is expensive - - but very , very little is needed ; a 16 - ounce box of gluten - free bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum - - maybe 20 cents' worth of xanthan gum . betty crocker is charging over 5 times what it would cost you to make their " mix " at home , while eliminating the major convenience factor ( and cost to themselves , but not to you ) of their regular baking mix . i don't mind their making a fair profit , especially if the product really were the equivalent of regular bisquick . but they're gouging us , and being misleading about the product . make your own , easily , and for less than 20 % of what they charge ! since there's no oil in gluten - free bisquick , you can easily stir up an equivalent , make 5 pounds ( or more ! ) at a time , with very little effort , and it will keep for several months . or , if you want a real bisquick substitutes , betterbatter . org has a recipe on the site for a cup - for - cup substitute for bisquick that does use shortening and non - fat dry milk powder . or you can use buttermilk powder , or even vance's dairy - free powder . it makes 10 cups at a time , stores well , and you don't have to use their gluten - free flour - - you can use any gluten - free flour replacement you want ( like rice flour and potato starch from your local asian store , mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum , about 1 / 2 teaspoon for every two cups ) . to find the recipe , do a google search of " betterbatter bisquick substitute master mix . " boo on betty crocker . 
=================
unexpected , very mild flavor . i do a lot of stirfry and sesame oil is a very easy way to get a nice taste and smell with very little . just opening the bottle , i knew it was already a dud . used it and it was so bland , i wish i would have been a little less lazy and had just found an asian market nearby to buy some more sesame oil . won't make the same mistake twice !

popcorn this popcorn does all pop . doesn't have much taste . i will get the seasoning salt or something and see how it tastes after that . i have poured butter over it but then to me that defeats the idea of diet stuff .

okay not a lot of flavor in this item , but i like the idea of the natural ingredents

a tasty treat for your large dog these are large biscuits that can be broken in half easily , but are still large . i gave a half to my 48 pound mutt and she spit it out at first not sure what to do with it . she's used to the small peanut butter treats from costco . i encouraged her to eat it and she finally did . she left quite a few crumbs along the way which eventually were eaten . obviously my dog liked the way the biscuits tasted but i like the neatness of smaller dog treats . if you have a small dog , these wouldn't work unless you wanted to spend time breaking them into smaller chunks . if you have a large dog and are looking for an organic alternative , try these . 
=================
flavor doesn't last long gum tastes good but flavor does not last long . they need to improve the gum and make the pieces bigger . 
=================
rating on taste & effect on thought , not price i did not buy a case of this , i bought a couple at sunflower markets to try out . in spite of what i've read others say , it tastes good . however , it's not like your buying this for something tasty . it helps me when i drink this , as i have a brain fog that tides away for the most part when i drink this . i've stopped and it slowly comes back . that being said , for $ 2 . 00 - $ 2 . 50 / daily , a little expensive for 8 . 4 oz . ( 1 cup ) at sunflower markets , it was 2 for 5 . 00 , which is where i got the $ 2 . 50 price tag . you figure 1 month being 30 days , $ 2 would be $ 60 . then again , i guess some people do smoke cigarettes at around $ 50 / carton , so it's not a far stretch for some . . . 
=================
kinda strange these are odd but i don't hate them . i really prefer soft cookies to hard ones . they're small and have a powdery peach flavored coating on them . they remind me a little of the lemon girl scout cookies but peach flavored . the gf didn't like them . gave the rest as gifts for christmas . suckas . 
=================
poor packaging great tasting coffee but the last 2 shipments have had many damaged k cups , the top layer is poorly glued in place

tastes good , but not like eggnog i was hesitant to try this tea because i thought eggnog - flavored tea sounded like a weird combination , and i'm not even a big fan of eggnog by itself . however , it turns out it doesn't really taste like eggnog anyway ! it has a mild nutty / vanilla flavor to it instead ; it's very similar to the celestial seasonings " nutcracker sweet " flavor . i like it , but probably not enough for it to displace my other favorite flavors .

i hate to say " me , too " , but . . . i recently purchased my first keurig machine , the b60 model ( which is wonderful , by the way ) , and my machine was one of those " bonus packages " that came with a small variety sampler pack ( 12 k - cups ) . having gone through most of this fantastic assortment already , i decided to order a variety assortment from amazon . i read all the reviews - - positive and negative - - and decided to take a chance on this one . it arrived today , and although there are some neat flavors that i am anxious to try , there is very little variety . i ordered the 24 - count sampler . out of these , 4 k - cups are truly unique / limited edition flavors that are not green mountain . that leaves 20 k - cups of green mountain that either french vanilla ( the majority ) , caramel vanilla cream , blueberry or hazelnut . luckily , these are at least flavors i like , they are just not all that unique . probably won't order from these folks again , due to the lack of variety . i was really hoping for more choices , like the one that came with my keurig ( the sampler pack had 12 different coffees from all different coffee companies , some i hadn't heard of and were quite good ) . i hate to whine , but my morning cup is a very important part of my day ! too bad . . . if you like french vanilla with a few surprises thrown in , then this assortment is for you , but not if you are looking for a true variety .

 $ 4 . 33 per loaf just experimenting with gluten free to see if i notice any difference in a a couple of issues i'm dealing with . just bought this . tastes pretty good , and my wife likes it too after expressing initial skepticism . this stuff comes in at $ 3 . 33 per pound . it takes 3 1 / 2 cups per loaf which weighs 1 . 30 lbs , which comes out to $ 4 . 33 per loaf + eggs + 1 hour cooking time . so , you know that's really not so bad , but i guess one doesn't want to be throwing it to the birds .

my favorite sugarfree gum i've tried a lot of different brands of sugarfree gum , but this has my favorite taste . because it is bubblegum , it tends to stay soft longer than most other types of gum . many sugarfree gums these days use sugar alcohol , and this one does , too , but though others have caused me digestive problems , this one doesn't seem to . it has a mixture of sweeteners : sorbitol ( sugar alcohol ) , mannitol ( sugar alcohol ) , acesulfame k , and sucralose ( the generic name for splenda ) . there is controversy over artificial sweeteners , and some experts consider them dangerous to the health , so that is something to be aware of when chewing any sugarfree gum . it's also important to note that sometimes people who chew a lot of gum with sugar alcohol develop symptoms that look and feel like ibs ( irritable bowel syndrome ) . several different dentists have also warned me that it is bad for the temporomandibular joint ( tmj ) in your jaw to chew gum a lot . 
=================
one of the best k cups , but buy elsewhere ! if you enjoy dark or " extra bold " k cups , then this is for you . i've tried just about all of the dark and darker k cups , ( that i know of ) , and this is one of the few that i will continually repurchase . that said , this seller is counting on the foolish or uninformed to sell this online , as it is a sub - brand that is unique to target . ( as in the store . . . ) apparently , caribou , ( who is now owned outright by green mountain ) created obsidian specifically for target , as it is not even mentioned on the caribou website . anyway , the " everyday " price $ 11 . 99 , but it often " on sale " for less - once even $ 8 . 99 . just to be fair , i guess you could continue to buy it through amazon - please note that this is not sold by amazon - for more than twice the price . guess where they , ( my favorite things , llc - aka amazon reseller dejour ) , are getting it from ?

love this coconut milk i've never purchased this from amazon ( it's cheaper at my local store ) . so this review is solely about the product . i have been using this coconut milk for almost a year . i think it's creamy , tasty , doesn't contain any added crud except guar gum which is used as a stabilizer . i chill the can in my fridge so the cream separates from the water . then i scoop out the cream into a jar and use the cream in my coffee . i sometimes whip the cream with cinnamon and / or vanilla for extra flavour too ! alternately , if you shake the can really well , then transfer to a jar and refrigerate , the cream doesn't totally seperate and you're left with a very creamy product . perhaps people complaining this product is watered down / separating are not giving their cans adequate " rest " time after being delivered and then chilling ? i imagine they get pretty shaken up during transport from amazon to your home ? anyways , i'd give this product a 5 if the can was bpa free and they ditched the guar gum ( like natural valley brand ) .

price . . . . gluten free . . . very price competitive with health food stores when purchased via amazon . . . another good gluten free item . . .

addictive , empty filler , but my cat went anorexic without it my older cat , 4 years , got " hooked " on hill's science diet kitten formula when i brought a new kitten , along with a big bag of free s / d , home from the pound . [ prior to that , my well - adjusted cat would eat raw chicken , high quality canned foods , organic kibble - - all the " good stuff " ] both cats thrived on s / d . so much so that the kitten grew and grew and grew , into a hefty 9 pounds at 7 months . the 4 year - old cat began ignoring her own food and started eating the kitten's food . she filled out , also , but to a nice adult weight of 6 pounds . okay , so 2 months later the kitten is up to 10 pounds and can barely walk without panting . she cannot stop eating this s / d stuff . she's enormous , way bigger than her 4 year - old housemate . i decide to switch back to the healthier food - - like innova evo , which is 88 % meat protein and grain free . i also augment with superior wet food ( the 100 % organic , human grade stuff , along with raw chicken , etc ) . kitten is okay with that switch - - like a tiger she tears away at the raw chicken , gulps at the premium can food - - but the older cat doesn't like it , although i do it very gradually over 3 months . i sit with her , pet her , calm her . . . yes , she does eat , just not much - - a few kibble crunches , or a tablespoon of wet food . [ cornell has over 300 studies on anorexic cats ] . a couple months go by and the kitten is looking better , not panting as much ( and 2 pounds lighter ) but our 4 year - old cat is now down to 2 . 9 pounds ! all her ribs show and she has bones where her shoulders are . she looks like a cheetah that's been deprived of food . no mater what food i put in front of her - - dry , wet , kibble , shredded meat - - she will only nibble bits and pieces , here and there . her fur has lost its glossy coat . the vet tells me i have to do something , anything , to stop the decline in my cat's health , even if it means feeding the crummy science diet kitten food , original formula . i am two days into feeding the cat the s / d kitten food . she is wolfing this stuff down as if there's no tomorrow . it makes me sad that she's become another s / d addict - - it's that darn corn filler , converts to sugar and cats love it . i know , i'd rather have her alive and eating this crud , then wasting to nothing away on more nourishing food . at least i can console myself that the kitten knows she's a feline and eats like one .

coffee drinks gf international coffee is great and handy in this size container , however , much cheaper in the local stores , even though you need to purchase smaller containers . sorry , this did not save me any money .

just what a dog needs ? why is this in my quick picks ? i don't even own a dog ! but just from reading the ingredients , i say give this stuff a pass . it has potato , tomato , peas , blueberries and raspberries in it , none of which are a part of a dog's natural diet . canines of all kinds get all the nutrition required in the wild just from eating meat . anything else is just filler .

not good enough for me to make the switch this 100 % juice , carbonated beverage is a good alternative to traditional soda . as a somewhat health - conscious consumer , i avoid high fructose corn syrup ( hfcs ) as much as possible . this beverage contains no hfcs , no added sugar , no preservatives , and no added color . i'm sampling the orange flavor . it contains 100 % of your daily recommended dose of vitamin c , and 20 % of your vitamin a for the day . the downside is a single 8 . 3 fl oz can contains almost as many calories as a 12 oz a can of soda . the orange - tangerine flavor reminds me a bit of orangina . perhaps you've tried crystal geyser's fruit squeeze beverages which are also similar . it's definitely not comparable to artificially flavored orange beverages ( sunkist , crush ) . it has a hint of grapefruit - like taste to it , but without the bitterness , which may be due to the added apple , grape , and acerola concentrates . the aftertaste is a bit metallic to me . the beverage itself is clear - without pulp of any kind - and is light - orange - yellow in color . this is a good alternative to those looking for something soda - like , but healthier than all the hfcs - loaded options . maybe it's a good option for parents to give to their kids if their kids drink a lot of soda anyway . personally , i don't enjoy it enough to buy it instead of other available , similar products . if i want orange juice or crave soda , i'll rather drink the real thing . 
=================
good chocolate , but price scam honestly , i should stop my automatic one - stop - easy - shop addiction shopping at amazon . this is just another example of purchasing at amazon a product that , after the fact , i find in several other places for a much lower price . in fact , amazon's " sale " of 2 boxes for $ [ . . . ] , is more than the regular price at several other stores . additionally , the packages came with big stickers " ready for shipment , " on them which were not easy to peel off ( makes for tacky looking gifts ) . search elsewhere . you'll find you'll save money . these are tasty , however . we've had them before and enjoyed them .

excellent mix , rancid nuts i loved this trail mix , but the nuts in all the bags were spoiled ( i assume because of amazon storage ? ) . really disappointing because i'd love to order this product again at this price .

my puppy likes purina better my puppy was on royal canin but we switched her to wellness pupy b / c i eventually wanted her on wellness core but she doesn't seem to like it . i have to mix the can with it in order for her to eat it . she was with a dog sitter for a week while we were out of the country and she came back with her food container full . she seemed more solid , like she'd gained a lot more weight in just a week . apparently she ate their dog food and wouldn't touch her more expensive food . now that she's home , she's gone back to barely eating it . i'll try another brand after we finish this bag . i'm sure the nutrition in it is great but if i can't get my dog to eat it , what good is it ? 
=================
love the taste , hate the new price i have been drinking this coffee for years - 1 cup every morning . a can lasts me about 2 weeks . purchased a six - pack here on amazon for $ 12 . 50 ( free shipping because we buy into the 1 yr of free shipping deal ) and thought i was in heaven ! it would have been even cheaper had i signed up for the coffee club . at $ 34 . 95 plus $ 10 . 51 shipping , forget it ! ! check out your local walmart . it has been running $ 3 . 00 - $ 3 . 25 there . limited selection of flavors , but the french vanilla has always been there .

amazing mustard but riduculous shipping charge i absolutely love this mustard - hands down my favorite . but - almost $ 10 for shipping . that is just riduculous and a total rip - off . would never spend that kind of money for a jar of mustard , no matter how amazing it is .

good , but these aren't caramels i was disappointed that these are not caramels - the description should read " caramel - flavored hard candies " as that is what these are . however , i was not disappointed in the taste - these are made of largely natural ingredients , and they taste like it . the " liquid honey " center is more chewy than liquidy . texturally these are not really as described - but again they taste good . a for " energy " , energy is in this context a synonym for calories , and the small number of calories per piece is not going to do much . the vitamin content is okay - about 1 / 3 of the rda for 3 main vitamins - but using these to get your requirements could be pricey . so , i like the taste , i like the natural ingredients , and these are a healthier substitute for candy , but they aren't a great source of energy or vitamins . i'd buy these , but mostly for the taste rather than the nutritional claims . 
=================
there is nothing else like it ! sensitive to wheat & yeast ? lots of folks are and don't know it . our family has been off both for seven years ( much better health , lost 30 lbs too ) and this bread is the only thing we can consistently rely upon not to cause any reaction . and it is shelf stable , so even if our store doesn't stock it , ordering it online is quite manageable in bulk . taste ? well it isn't a bagette in in the sun on the cote d'azur , but few things are . well toasted , with butter , jelly , or in a sandwich - great . ( especially when compared to air - also gluten and yeast free . ) 
=================
too expensive to be a " treat " the product came attractively packaged in a vacuum packed flat resealable plastic pouch . the tuna had a strong tuna smell , which immediately brought our cats running over to inspect . at 4 . 1 ounces , this is more of a meal than a treat . while you could cut off a piece and save the rest for another time , this isn't what i think of when buying kitty treats . . . kitty treats to me are crunchy and small , so that i can shake the container to call our cats over and then sprinkle out a couple of treats at a time . with this prodcut , we replaced our usual fancy feast dinner and served our 2 cats the entire 4 . 1 ounce pouch . i found that it looked a little dry , but i will say that the cats gobbled up the food like it was their last meal . overall , our cats seemed to like it , but i have some issues with the way the product is marketed . if this is to be used as a treat , it needs to be easier to serve in small pieces . if it is to be used as a meal , then the price needs to be lowered alot . i would never purchase this product as is . 
=================
color enhancing ? you've got to be kidding ! a steady diet of this caused my goldfish to lose color . and i don't mean a little . i mean she went from being a gorgeous red and orange to shock white . other goldfish in my tank also started losing colors . after inspecting the ingredients , trying to figure out the problem , i discovered it's full of fillers , and more importantly lake colors . a lake color will only disperse in oil , sucrose , or alcohol . it's also the same stuff you find in your makeup . what do you think that does to a poor fish's digestive system ? i will never buy this again . oh , and that color change issue with my goldfish ? 1 year later , on a good frozen pure food diet , the white goldfish is still white , and the ones who lost some of their color , never did regain it .

works ! when we first got this product my husband was in a hurry and tried just placing it at the top of the gopher holes . 2 days passed and nothing . then when we had time , we went out and installed them correctly , digging out the tunnel and placing it in , then reburying it with some twine attached so we didn't loose it . we left it buried for 24 hours before checking it and sure enough , we had caught the gopher . it looked like it would be pretty nasty to try and get the gopher off the trap so we just buried the whole thing . we still had another trap if needed and at this cheap price , i didn't mind .

sweet & carbonated ~ nice , but not for everyone i like this 'kiwi berry' more than the 'watermelon strawberry' i reviewed previously : it's less sweet , but still a little too sweet for me . it advertises 'no sugar added' and '100 % juice carbonated' , so i was expecting somewhat sweet tasting , but not like this ~ it was too sweet , and packed 135 calories , 36g sugar and 34g carbs in a 'no sugar added' - 'no corn syrup' - 'no preservatives' - 'no artificial colors' - 'gluten free' drink ! i would expect that from a juice like apple or cranberry , but i would also expect it to taste natural , and this one ( for all it's claims to the contrary ) still did not taste very natural to me . it was certainly pleasant tasting , but for the tastebuds of someone who was a lifelong soda drinker ( diet soda for the past 12 years ) , and gave up soda completely last may ( i don't miss it at all ! ) , this is not the drink for me . i mostly drink water , milk , iced tea , hot tea & coffee now , and this sweet tasting , sugary tasting beverage , had way too much carbonation & flavoring for me ! the kiwi berry flavors were nice ( much nicer than the watermelon strawberry ) , but still tasted fake , which is weird for a drink that touts things like '100 % juice' and a label that says 'natural flavors' . . . i would recommend this product only to those who like sweet , fruitie carbonated beverages , and aren't too worried about calories , etc .

this is nuts . pure salt is simply sodium chloride . most of the table salt we eat comes from underground . michigan is a giant salt mine . if you want trace minerals , go buy a cattle lick block for 10 bucks and grind it down . take supplements or eat a balanced diet . the main difference between one salt and another is texture . i prefer flaked kosher salt for my steaks and veggies .

just keep a wet cloth or water tap nearby these organic prunes are my favorites for snacking at home . their softness and intense flavor makes them downright sensuous . because of their high fiber content , i eat only 2 or 3 prunes a day . one bag lasts me a week or more . so i refrigerate them . only once have i encountered a pit . i have never noticed pit " chips " . there is one catch . whenever i touch even one , it leaves a sticky mess on my hand . before i touch anything else , i need to wash it off . in search of a less messy prune , i tried one bag of ( made in nature organic plums , pitted , dried and unsulfured , 6 - ounce bags ( pack of 6 ) ) . they were dry to the touch , but cost more than newman's own and didn't have as much flavor .

not a hit in our house . . . so far . i don't like this stuff at all , and most importantly , neither do my cats . i wanted them to get use to a better kind of litter and first tried the yesterday's news only to have them avoid it like the plague . then i thought maybe they would like this if it had a natural fresh scent . hard to say because even when i put a little in one box with their regular litter , which is clay , only one of my 3 will even venture in only to hop right back out . i have 3 cats and have 4 boxes set up for them which are cleaned at least twice daily . . . i know i know , i'm a clean fanatic with that which they are happy about to be honest . anyway , this stuff is bright yellow and has an awful smell to it and it is dusty ! the pieces are so big and i'm guessing it would be uncomfortable to walk on . anyway , i can't picture this one being a winner and will probably try the cedar chips as one last try . after that , i think i'm done trying to fix something that isn't broken . i mean after all , they all use the boxes exclusively so i may just leave well enough alone . if they don't want to be eco friendly , heaven only knows i can't make them . update 12 - 31 - 2011 : after several weeks of trying to entice them to using this , i gave up . i put just a little in one box , out of 4 . . . i have 3 cats , and they all avoided that one . even the one who was most curious about it and had investigated it in the beginning wanted nothing to do with that box . 
=================
finally figured it out i tried these in my senseo machine due to the unavailability of their brand of coffee pods . several attempts and finally got a decent cup of coffee . if you use the single holder and wet the pod first you get stronger coffee with the foam ! these hold more coffee and you get water blow by if they are dry . weak nasty brown stuff that no one would want to drink . tried the double holder with similar results . got the idea for wetting them off the internet . wish i could give the person credit who figured it out ! 
=================
good but perhaps not the best i think it's ok and not a big dissappointment but i was expecting a bit more aroma for the money . perhaps the aloha island platinum pods are better , but here's a sure winner for you : senseo douwe egberts colombia blend coffee pods , 16 - count packages ( pack of 4 ) . i actually prefer the columbian to this .

good product , not good vendor this product is a perfect substitute for the syrupy , cloying sweetness used in commercial mocha drinks . it makes a very satisfying home - brewed white mocha espresso drink . i buy it by the case if it is affordable . i purchased this recently from diabeticfriendly llc , who advertised a case at a great price , with shipping at an appropriate $ 29 . 81 . vendor sent me one bottle ( @ $ 10 + yikes ! ! ! over twice the cost of lollicup per bottle ) and charged the amazon shipping rate ( $ 29 . 81 ) for a case of 12 bottles . when i contacted vendor , he got nasty and accused me of trying to rip him off . i had to contact amazon repeatedly , before the vendor refunded , but the vendor continued to send nasty emails calling me names . check out his reviews . . . it looks like he blames the customer when they complain about his high shipping charges . as well they should complain , amazon has set shipping - by - weight that the vendor is required to follow . if the product is listed correctly by the vendor , then shipping should not be in dispute or excessive . i would never have purchased from this vendor if he had listed the product correctly . 
=================
aspartame free unless it's just not labeled correctly , this is the only gum i have found ( besides bubble gum ) that does not contain aspartame . i have literally checked every package of gum at all of our stores in town and every single one has aspartame , even the non sugar free ! way to go dentyne classic ! !

the invisible threat becomes better camouflaged oh yeah ! five stars to applaud your ingenuity and audacity , kool aid man ! the kool aid man has been and remains a giant threat to liberty and freedom . he was originally designed in the late 70's and early 80's to undermine free societies the world over . he is usually filled with red ` kool aid' , red for communism and he intended to flood our cultures with that oppressive red liquid . furthermore , he is characterized as someone for whom no wall can stop . he was specifically designed to burst through the berlin wall and end democracy in the western world . his original plan failed . but that is not the end of the threat . kool aid is manufactured in mexico . that is right people , the wall defeating menace is poised on our very borders . imagine the immigrant problem we will have when our border walls ( like in arizona ) are turned into swiss cheese . and as if that were not enough , now he has developed camouflage ! now he is an invisible wrecking ball of doom for our borders , our children , and our very way of life . the kool aid man , like all truly dangerous foes , commands my grudging respect . while i salute your cleverness and tenacity , i will not rest until your mask has been removed and all see you for the threat you are . i long for the day when your plans are derailed . i cannot wait to hear you look upon the ruins of your plot and cry with despair : " oh no " .

newsflash : this product does advertise as msg free ! okay , i love this stuff ; it's great to use in numerous dishes as a flavor enhancer . so , why am i writing this review ? because some people on this site like to rant and rave about a product technically having msg . for the record and i have six different flavors of this product , there is no mention of this product being msg free on any of the packaging . okay ? so , stop giving bad reviews to this product because you claim they advertise as msg free . they do not do that , and you are spreading lies . you know who you are ! stop giving this product bad reviews for made up reasons . read the label !

izze flavors are actually a mix of different juices , pom tasted like cranberry but grapefruit was better . izze is a great concept , especially as this is one soda that is actually a little healthier than the usual carbonated beverages . i ordered the pomegranate and grapefruit and preferred the latter much more . pomegranate : i love pomegranate juices like pom and other organic alternatives available [ . . . ] as it is a very heart healthy drink . however , despite my liking for the tart taste , the izze pomegranate juice in cans has a slightly bitter after taste and does not taste as good as real pomegranate juice . it may be due to the dilution or just because this pomegranate juice is " adulterated " with more cranberry juice than pomegranate ! it does state on the can that it is a mixture of several juices like grape , pineapple , cranberry . however , since the can said pomegranate i was expecting the juice to be primarily pomegranate and i feel slightly cheated if i taste more cranberry . it would be nice to see more information on the can about the proportion of pomegranate juice in this juice mix . since i found this juice to be a little too bitter , i tried making a " pom - cosmo - tini " , essentially a cosmopolitan using izze pom and it turned out quite delicious . now i know where the rest of the case is going , time to throw a party ! grapefruit : this one tasted a whole lot better and has none of the bitter after taste of the pomegranate . it tastes more like real grapefruit although this is also a mix of several juices . in a taste test , i asked my friends to try the pom and the grapefruit . everyone was excited to see the stylishly slim can but no one liked the pom flavor . in fact one person said it tasted like cough syrup and poured it down the sink . my daughter also rejected the pomegranate after one sip and finished half the grapefruit can . i was hoping she'd like izze a bit more so i could give her some to drink at school , i believe the apple and the blackberry flavors are sweeter so i'll try those next .

fine but don't buy it at $ 35 + $ 7 + for shipping this product can be had for $ 12 for two cans from other vendors . don't get ripped off by the one seller offering it at shameful , ripoff prices here on amazon . do some internet research and be glad you did . normally , i wouldn't mind a bit of a mark - up but 300 % is just shameful .

not for chipmunks ! i will update this review in time if a different conclusion is reached , however , after about a month of time and two applications we still have chipmunks burrowing under our step and patio . i will say that it seems the chipmunks frequent our patio and back step less now than they did a month ago , but they are not gone . i think this product would be more effective if all of my neighbors used this product too . i live in a suburban area and our yards are small and our houses are close together . i know that all my neighbors have chipmunk problems too , so maybe if we all used this product , then i would find this to be more successful .

love the taste ; don't love the packaging ! i've been using this syrup for almost a year . i really love the taste of this product ; no funny aftertaste like some sweeteners . it's rich and thick , yet it pours easily . i primarily use it in my coffee . i think it actually improves the taste of my coffee . i would have given it five stars , but my last order leaked out around the caps during shipment ! the safety seals on the top of the bottles were all loose , and the syrup was all over the bottles and inside the box . i had to wash them all off ! this was the only shipment that i had this problem with , so i don't know what's going on with the packaging process , but i hope they fix it . the bottle caps weren't tight enough , and every time i used the syrup , somehow it would leak out around the cap . it would leak out and drip down the bottle and run underneath it , which made the bottle stick to my counter top . no matter how well i washed the bottle and dried it after using it , throughout the day it would slowly seep out and end up a sticky mess on one side and underneath . there is one other issue that i'm not happy about . the labeling is misleading . it says that it contains 23 . 5 ounces . typically , liquid products are labeled in ounces by volume , but this product is labeled in ounces by net weight . there is only about 17 liquid ounces in the bottle , which means that there is only a little over 2 cups of syrup per bottle . i was expecting almost 3 cups per bottle . i think amazon should update their wording to explain this fact , as there is a huge difference between 2 and 3 cups of syrup ! i have this product on auto - ship . i will order it one more time , but if there are leaking problems with that shipment , i won't order it again until the problem is fixed .

my dog loves this stuff my old dog , who can be a bit of a princess , loves this stuff . the " sirloin " bits are soft and chewy while the other bits are crunchy like traditional kibble . my dog is big , but the bits are small enough that a very small dog would enjoy it as well . i usually wet my dog's kibble ( she doesn't like it dry ) and add a scoop or two of canned food . with this , and because she isn't one of those dogs who immediately eats as much as is put down , i can free - feed her the food without it spoiling . so , it's a success with her . with me , it's almost a success . i'm not crazy that the food contains animal digest which , according to wikipedia , can contain all sorts of things i don't want my dog eating , including product from dead , dying , diseased , or disabled animals . or roadkill , rats , animals euthanized in " shelters . " i don't know what this particular animal digest contains but that is part of the problem . i want to know exactly what is in the food i give my animals . unfortunately , it is hard to find dog food that doesn't have something nasty in it . and also unfortunately , this food isn't an exception to the rule .

horizon has changed it's quality i was an avid fan of horizon's chocolate milk until the recent change of last month . everything about their product has been cheapened : the carton , the price , but most importantly , the taste . it used to taste like creamy chocolate pudding . perhaps they use less chocolate , but the taste is no longer there .

greedy dealer cut my coke so , what happens when coca - cola gets involved in a perfectly good all natural tasting drink with all natural ingredients and no big plastic waste ? it gets industrialized of course ! this tastes like some number crunchers worked on lowering the price per unit to boost the profit margin and marketers worked on bottle material and bottle shape with a test group until it scored a good percentile and voila , you get a processed liquid in a plastic bottle . one of their biggest problems with all of this was that their original customers' palates had only experienced pure cw , so we all knew better . we were used to the good stuff and then our dealer got greedy and cut our coke , i mean our coconut water , and they lost alot of buyers to others dealing the pure stuff . now i buy zico in the 33 . 8oz tetrapacks . it's the pure stuff . knowing that zico sometimes reads these reviews i'm wondering out loud here if someone inside zico , with a sense of taste , just has to be saying " i told you so " ever since this version was released . if so many customers hate it you just know that someone inside zico must have hated it too . whoever that discerning person is has since been acknowledged i'm sure . . .

very good , smooth coffee when fresh i got my bag from costco and it was really good . i'm not sure how amazon's version is but the coffee i got was very smooth and not at all acidic or sour as others complained . the batch must have been really fresh since the glass container i put it in would pop every time i opened it . when i roast coffee , this will occur from the gasses being released and expanding . again , i got mine from costco and from my guess , they take orders and have them filled directly from the company , so it was pretty fresh . the price was very decent for organic fair trade as well . even for espressos , latte's and cap's , it's a very nice coffee . highly recommend . suggestion , don't over grind or drink after coffee has been sitting too long , it will get sour and / or bitter . don't buy coffee that's been sitting on shelves too long either . oh yeah , don't ever buy coffee from tjmaxx , marshall's , ross , or home goods ( i know , they're basically the same store ) . every time i've bought a food item from these companies it was horrid ! ! a batch of coffee i got from tjmaxx turned to dust when i tried to grind it ! ? they wouldn't take it back either . even the clothes are irregular , but food items , forgettabboutit .

great taste but very fragile i bought a case of 12 16oz boxes and am down to the the last four . while very tasty these crackers are so fragile that they're not much good other than adding a small slice of summer sausage or a smoked oyster on one . if you try putting peanut butter or other spread the cracker just breaks into pieces in your hand . when i reorder i'm going back to regular ritz crackers . . . maybe that's the re reason they're on sale .

young thai coconuts coconut water travels well in coconuts . young thai coconuts are a specialty export that provides water directly out of the coconut , assuming the gentle consumer takes the time to figure out how to open the coconut ( hint : youtube ) . finally consider 12 pieces of this product for $ 21 versus 9 pieces of young thai coconuts for maybe $ 8 from 99 ranch , a great chain of asian supermarkets .

love the product , not the price great product , i use this product weekly and it really helps me alot , altho if your body doesnt absorb vitamin b12 well , its probably not going to do much for you . horrible price , find this product at dollar tree , and dollar general for $ 1 each , or get it direct from the manufacturer's website at a cost of $ 9 . 99 for a carton of 12 !

get ready for a long wait i ordered based on the 5 star review and it's taking 2 months to receive . when i originally placed my order it was showing as available . however it's been a long wait . i was looking for easter candy , might make it to me by fathers day . they need to do a better job of fulfilling their orders , i'm going to be so annoyed by the time i receive it that i'm not going to like it no matter what it tastes like .

where's the carbs and calories ? my daughter and i ordered these " noodles " from amazon when we were on a diet . i am diabetic , so they were doubly useful for me . i read the reviews and found that the advice to rinse throughly and season heavily is the best way to prepare them . . i bought the angel hair and the rice . we did not care for the rice . i prepared the angel hair by cooking it dry in a pan with chopped onions . . cook it for a good while . i then added spaghetti sauce and cooked chicken and simmered it for some more time . it was not like a meal at an italian restaurant ; but when you consider the caloeies and carbs being saved , it was quite palatable . the only thing i really missed was the buttered garlic bread ! we gritted our teeth and ate another serving of the angel hair . another plus ; the website for the noodles has a lot of info and good advice .

wouldnt order online again only 2 of the cans were in perfect condition - all the others were dented very badly . last time i order cans on line i guess

gives you incentive to work out after 20 min . of drinking when people say " read the directions " , you must . you aren't supposed to ingest the whole bottle . it's meant for 2 servings for 2 separate days . i like going to the gym , but i stress staying on the elliptical , unless i drink only half of this small bottle . i do 60 minutes on elliptical and sweat like crazy . after that , i literally can run on the treadmill for another hour . i did this several times , and i got bad knees and shouldn't be running . this tells you how much stamina you have once drinking half . if you want to lose weight while working out , but can't get yourself to stay in the gym long because of procrastination , lazyness or lack of energy , this is your product . just beware by not becoming addicted to this harsh , liquid drug . i can't have a normal workout without it .

not soy milk . . . it is tasty ( like coffee mate which i actually like ) but i'm afraid it's far less nutritious than soy milk or milk - - - - 1 serving ( 23g powder ) has 100 calories but only contains 2g of protein ( 26g of non - fat milk powder contains 9g protein ! ) . and the list of ingredients for this product is long with several long words . . . i will keep it but only as coffee creamer ( to be fair , it is probably healthier than regular coffee creamer . ) buti don't think it is as natural , healthy , and nutritious as soy milk .

not the best brand i've tried the first brand of cedar litter i tried was pet smart's exquisicat cedar litter and like it . then tried feline pine because i found it at walmart for a bit less . but it is much more dusty and scooping it out meant clouds of dust , so i thought that can't be too good for the cats to dig in . switching back to the pet smart brand . i see on the box that it contains some clay , but you'd never know it as the product is light and fragrant .

rustichella makes great pasta . . . . . . but it would be desecration to put this gunk on any decent pasta , let alone rustichella's . jarred pesto is to freshly - made pesto as instant coffee is to freshly - brewed mocha - java from peet's . i've been silly enough to try various brands of pesto in jars , and none of them would glean more than two stars . the frozen brands are marginally better , but the only justification for store - shelf pesto is the unavailability of fresh basil , even then , you'd do better to make a pesto recipe with any soft herb you have : arugula , dandelion , parsley , mashed artichoke . . . if i lived in nunavut i'd probably use lichen from the belly of a caribou rather than depend on jarred pesto . here's a basic pesto recipe for a small batch : 50g of basil leavesextra virgin olive oil6 tbsp grated parmigiano reggiano or grana padano2 tbsp pecorino ( romano , toscano , sardo or siciliano ) 2 cloves of garlic1 tbsp pine nutscoarse sea saltthe traditional method uses a wooden pestle and a marble mortar . start by pounding the garlic and salt until you get a smooth paste . add the basil , a handful at a time , and keep grinding until each batch of the leaves is incorporated . to preserve the essential oils in the basil , don't be too rough with it . add the pine nuts and grind some more . add the cheese and mix well . add the oil , little by little , until the pesto has the right consistency - a matter of taste . serve with pasta or added to minestrone . the recommended pastas are troffie , trofiette or trenette , but it goes with just about any pasta . i usually serve it with spaghetti or linguine . if somebody has an interesting variation , post it as a comment .

i like the concept of an instant coffee . . . . i picked up a package of via out of curiosity . for the record , i am the owner of a coffee roastery and a cafe which has won " coffee bar of the year " for the past 4 years in ct . we roast coffee for other cafes as well so i feel i have a pretty good grasp of what a good coffee should taste like . here's my impression of via : it is certainly easy to prepare . i generally drink a 16oz coffee so i used 2 packets ( they are sized for an 8oz serving ) to prepare my cup . the coffee is ready to drink as soon as it is stirred . i drink my coffee black and what i taste is only the coffee ( my preference for brewing water is a neutral ph of 7 , a langelier index of zero and no chlorine , fluoride , or lime ) . on to the coffee : a good colombian should be very balanced , with good body , brightness * and a nutty flavor . truth be told , most colombian coffee on the market is a bit boring , and most are at best a simply decent , clean cup with almost no aftertaste . unfortunately this is only true if it's fresh * * from a roaster which is unlikely . the via colombian that i tried might have started out as an arabica coffee from the low end of the specialty coffee spectrum . since i don't know the timeline for production , it is very difficult to say how old the coffee was to begin with but there is definitely a " woody " note that i associate with aged beans . the actual flavor might not be terrible if you where able to separate out this woody note but unfortunately via has a very objectionable mouth feel and aftertaste . after a few seconds , there is a very noticeable residue left on your tongue that is bitter and astringent . i typically associate this with a brew that has had coffee grounds siting in it such as when a coffee filter collapses while brewing . bottom line for me : i would drink it only if my only other choice was a widely available and well known " donut " shop coffee ( which i am mystified why anyone would drink . . . just terrible ) . as for the flavored versions of via , i am really not a fan of any flavored coffee since these flavorings are typically unhealthy and serve mostly to mask the objectionable tastes of the coffee . i drink coffee because i like the flavor . this was my second tasting of via . i tried it when it was first released in 2009 and was hoping to see an improvement but my notes from that tasting are very similar . i really think that a high end instant is a good idea , but unfortunately for me , via misses the mark . for a quick and relatively convenient cup , i would suggest investing $ 30 in an " aeropress " made by aerobie and widely available . armed with a freshly roasted coffee from your local micro roaster , you get a tasty , easy to prepare cup , and a very simple cleanup . . * we use the descriptive term " acidity " to describe brightness . this is not to be confused with the often heard term " acidic " which people lament about a coffee that upsets their stomachs . this is thought of by many people in the industry to be the result contamination of chemical fertilizers , pesticides , molds , fungus , and other contaminants often found in non - specialty grade coffee . we believe that most of these complaints would disappear simply by trying a better quality coffee . * * fresh = less than two weeks from roasting . most coffee is way beyond this timeline . . . .

no hexane solvents please remember that dha / ara added to infant formulas ( both non - organic and organic ) are extracted using petroleum - derived hexane solvents . one of the reasons i choose organic is to avoid hexane solvents ; hexane is a very efficient extraction procedure ( check wikipedia or google ) , but not organic . do a little research on what is in the dha added to infant formulas before you buy . it will be educational . also , as organic consumers , we breast fed whenever possible . formula is only used for supplementation . breast milk provides ample amount of dha & ara and all the other essential fatty acids . so getting more from an organic formula is just a waste of money .

my cats won't touch it i bought the reduced calorie food because my cats are inside all day long and are getting quite fat . they won't touch this stuff . they love the indoor variety but not the reduced calorie . overall i've been very happy with natural balance and the cats seem to devour the indoor but not the reduced . so now i have to mix the reduced with the indoor . they still seem to pick at the indoor and leave the reduced calorie in their bowls . man , cats can be so picky .

be careful ! some of these prunes do contain pits ! these prunes arrived well - packaged , double - sealed and fresh and moist . however , in one of the canisters i probably came across a half dozen prunes still containing a sharp pit or pieces of pit . i almost broke my tooth on one of the pits because i bit down on the prune and wasn't expecting something so hard . i would not give these prunes to children or to elderly people who may have fragile teeth . it is a good deal , so one option would be to carefully inspect and cut up the prunes into small pieces - - looking for the pits - - before giving to children or elderly .

cute but definitely not worth $ 30 i purchased this for $ 7 . 40 for my husband and had it shipped to his office . the candy was a big hit with he and his coworkers ! that being said , i would never pay full price ( $ 28 ) as there's not a whole lot in the box . if you can grab this when it's & lt ; $ 10 and get free shipping i say go for it ! : )

make certain you have the address and speed set . . . . . i have not yet tried the product . i ordered it on a saturday morning to the wrong address . i make this careless mistake all the time because i'm often not at my default address . i went to change it and got " this portion of your order is being prepared for shipment and cannot be canceled or changed , " less than five minutes after placing this order . beware .

pass the test ! these are everything they say , i have a malamute that annihilates bones within minutes . rawhide was not even in our consideration , he could rip it off in seconds and choke on sharp pieces . however , the choices out there are slim and i began my research again . after reading the reviews here i decided to risk it . this is really wrapped tight and he's been chewing on it for days , safely i might add , the rawhide is very thick before they even tightly roll it .

product listing incorrect - actually box of 24 bags when i placed this order i had a hard time getting information about this product from amazon . the listing is faulty , it looks like you are paying about $ 19 for one 1 . 8oz bag , especially since it indicates you are paying $ 10 . 46 / oz . i knew this had to be incorrect , so before placing the order , i contacted amazon who indicated there was a listing error but they thought this listing for actually supposed to be for 12 bags . i thought this didn't make sense either since the theater sized boxes , 3 . 1oz each , was only $ 10 . 52 for 12 boxes . this listing would cost almost double for far less product . i suspected that this was actually a box of 24 bags since the regular sour patch kids in the 1 . 8 oz size were listed as a box of 24 . i took a chance and ordered this and i am happy to report that it is , in fact , a box of 24 individual bags . i just wanted to share this information to help the next person who stumbles upon the listing . the gummis themselves are actually quite good .

spoiling my cat when my primary grocery store began charging 72 cent a can for fancy feast , i looked elsewhere and was thrilled to find that amazon . com had exactly what i wanted for 58 cents a can . i use two cases a month and being that i am disabled , and i no longer drive , having the two cases delivered to my door for no extra cost was a double treat . i went to order next months supply a few days ago and in one fell swoop the price has jumped up to the same as my grocery store . i will no longer purchase my fancy feast from amazon . com . the brand fancy feast is a perfect serving size and seems to be of a good quality even though i have never taken a bite . it was nice while it lasted .

not many flavors - lots of duplicates ! if you are wanting to try alot of different flavors ( as i was ) this is not a good choice . ( see the disclaimer at end of expl . saying some flavors may be substituted . ) we received : chocolate glazed donut , cinnamon roll , hazelnut , hazelnut decaf , french vanilla , mocha nut fudge , wild mountain blueberry , kahlua , creme caramel , caramel cappuccino . did not get : butter toffee , french vanilla supreme , mudslide , hazelnut , caramel vanilla cream , french vanilla decaf , southern pecan , creme caramel , hawaiian hazelnut , jamaica me crazy , vanilla francaise , french vanilla iced coffee , hazelnut cappuccino , french vanilla cappuccino . some flavors we got one of , two we got 5 of the same ! i could see switching one or two , but this many is crazy .

better off buying at store you can get a better deal purchasing a carton from walmart or an organic store ( roots ) nearby . i agree with the other reviewer . amazon should carry the 64 ounce containers ! ! !

yummy ! this is amazing syrup . you have to watch the price though . it fluctuates on amazon quite a bit . i bought this when it as offered on a buy one get one free deal . two bottles for $ 26 ! better deal than i can find locally . works great on waffles , pancakes and in baking . original review 11 / 2009 . update 9 / 2012i have this item on subscribe . it is listed as unavailable . however , it is for sale for a * new * subscription at a savings of only 5 % instead of the 15 % i have waiting on my list page . come on amazon ! do you think we would not notice the price change ? watch what you pay since the subscribes are changing so much . plus , even if i asked for it now , the policy is not to ship until my assigned date next month anyway . for now , i am going with another product and wait to see if they actually send me a jug of this or just cancel my current subscription to force me to change to the more expensive offer .

taste of course , they can't really help how these taste , but i didn't much like it . maybe they're not ripened all the way ? i don't know . but i know they're supposed to be good for me !

this wild alaskan salmon is right off the hook good . . . if you are a fan of specialty smoked salmon or prefer to select your fish at a seafood counter you may not care for bear & wolf . this is almost right off the hook good . it has that " fishy " taste that i actually prefer , but if you serve this up to those who don't care for it you'll be getting a thumbs down . if you've tried the kirkland brand , which is delightfully pink and flaky , you might be taken aback when you see and taste something from the wild . i do not like most canned salmon because it is farmed . . . some farming conditions are less than optimal ( such a turn off ) . this is wild alaskan salmon that crumbles when you take a fork to it . on the label it says , " satisfaction guaranteed or your money refunded .

great while it lasted my one year old lab . loved the bottle filled with his kibble . the kibble fell out when tossed around . he carried the bottle into the kitchen started tossing it and it cracked when it hit the tile floor at the screw end all kibble fell out and it broke into sharp pieces and it was a scramble to get the piece before he tried to eat and swallow them . you know labs they will eat anything halfway looking like food . the bottle is not very durable on hard surfaces . the same would have happened on the patio deck i am sure . expensive for the 30 minutes he used it .

please read before purchasing ! ! ! dogs are omnivores , meaning they can survive on a vegetarian diet , but by no means will they thrive without the inclusion of animal proteins . if you are genuinely concerned about the moral implications of a dog's diet and choose to feed this to your dogs , i would strongly suggest supplementing this food with free range eggs , sustainably harvested sardines , or some other source of animal protein that you deem morally acceptable . i have vegetarian friends who feed their dogs this and other formulas , and when compared to my lab , who is fed a high - protein , grain - free dog food , they almost look abused . literally , they are all very slim and their fur is coarse and patchy , as opposed to my dog , who is muscular , with fur is as soft as cotton , and as happy as can be . if you want an all - inclusive dog food that will handle your dog's nutritional needs , this is not the dog food for you . that said , if your morals won't allow you to use a dog food with named meat products as the top ingredients ( and there are organic varieties ) , then this may be a good option for you . please , just remember to supplement with some form of animal protein every time you feed .

dilly dilly . . . like the rosebud powder found here : rosebud - powder - 1 . 3 oz , i purchased this for incorporation into homemade ras el hanout . since the floral component of this multi - spice is quite small ( floral powders easily overwhelming other flavours if overused ) , i ended up with quite a bit left over for use in my perfume - making hobby or in sachets , etc . i found this to be a high - grade powdered lavender , the floral 'nose' being greater than the ( wholly expected and natural ) bitterness of it .

gelatinous and an odd sweet flavor i understand that opinions vary greatly in these things , but i cannot for the life of me see how so many people like the sweet baby ray's sauces . i tried the original recipe and this . the original was very ho hum but i thought this one was kind of gross . the taste is slightly fake , as if its not made with sugar or honey but with some sort of chemical . the texture is a bit gelatinous which contributes to the feeling of this being a synthetic product . it reminds me of american cheese . its not awful , and on the right application actually tastes good , but it isn't really cheese and eating it makes me feel kind of yucky . i have since moved on and tried a few other sauces commonly found in grocery stores . the one i landed on is " cattlemen's award winning kansas city classic barbecue sauce " . so good you could just drink it . try that one out . 
=================
contains fructose and torbinado sugar not sure how this can fall into the low carb camp when it's got crystalline fructose and torbinado sugar in the ingredients . i guess i don't consider 6 net grams of sugars to be low carb . . . but you may think otherwise . we all have different limits . i know , some claim that torbinado sugar is " better " for you because it's less processed , but that's like saying gin is better for your liver than everclear because it's distilled less . both have a serious impact on your liver . likewise , sugar and torbinado sugar have a serious impact on your body over time . sure , this tastes pretty darned good compared to other low carb brands , but in my opinion , that's because it's got more tasty sugar . the impact on my insulin after eating this is significant enough that i can't have it . just beware of that . lastly , i wish more food vendors would pay attention to sugars and wheats . there's getting to be a growing body of evidence that sugars ( fructose especially ) and wheat products are what's leading western countries into obesity and cancer . you can check out eatingacademy dotcom for the science behind it . 
=================
taste sorta like low salt broth flavor : it taste like low salt chicken broth . though the thing is the nutrient content isnt low in salt . it has around 60 % of your daily salt content . portion : it depends . some packages only are half full and some are over filled . though to me it doesnt fill me up . price : it is less expensive at stores . it is around $ 0 . 25 at the store . on amazon it is $ 1 each . would i recomend this : no , i would recomend the shrimp flavor and chili flavor . i also recomend nongshim that japaneese or korean brand of ramen . thoose taste the best .

don't pay more than $ 6 - 7 a bag . . . companies like this are a rip off . you could buy and resell cheaper . walgreens and drugstore dot com sell these bags for under $ 8 . 6 . 99 at drugstore right now with free shipping at $ 25 . can't stand ripoff vendors on here . and . . . best dark chocolate toasted almonds out there . they use stevia to lightly sweeten so no added sugar , and the flavor is just addictive so be warned on your portion control or up your workouts to compensate . now if the dried mango market would start using stevia . tired of added sugar .

chia seed i read all of the good stuff associated with chia seed . my husband and i have been determined to eat healthier , and go organic when possible . we are succeeding in our endeavors , and thought that this product would fit right into our new lifestyle . i have attempted to get this seed into things that we eat regularly . it just does not work for me . i cannot get past the slime and mouth feel . for those of you who are able to , i think that is wonderful , but i am going to pass on any further use of it .

they changed the recipe ! i bought a box of this tea a few months ago , and it was amazing , best earl grey i have ever had . i decided to order a package of 6 boxes , and the tea i got was completely different . different packaging , different baggies , shorter string , and most importantly of all terrible tea . i cannot even drink it , it is so bad . it doesn't even taste like earl grey , but cheap lipton tea . there are no words to explain my utter disappointment . i would give it zero stars , if i could . update . . . i called two leaves and a bud to ask why this tea was so different , and they admitted that they have changed not only their tea source , but also their production / packaging facility . so the new tea is indeed a completely different product ( these changes span all packaging types : single boxes , bags , 100 count , and 6 - box count ) . their customer service however , is superb . they offered to replace the 6 boxes with any of their other products . i chose loose - leaf decaf earl grey ( which is almost as delicious as the pre - change earl grey ) . i didn't even need to ship the 6 boxes back - they told me to keep it , give it away , whatever . what an outstanding company !

a little weird , but my yorkie loved it . i guess i didn't really read the description of this product very well , but this was not what i expected ! it is like a little roller ball of deodorant only it is filled with liquid log treats . ( this one is bacon ) it was easy to open , but i did have to squeeze the bottle a little and then roll the ball around to get the initial liquid to come out . once my dog realized what she was supposed to do , she was all over it . in fact , she got so excited that she made her self sick . i'm saving this one for an " every now and then " treat .

quaker chewy - easily packable nutrition i like to buy these granola bars to hand out to homeless people and the needy . instead of giving them spare change - - which you never know what they are going to spend it on - - you can be sure they will be nourished if you give them food . obviously not really a " meal " but about as good as you can get at a reasonable price , individually wrapped and relatively healthy . 
=================
not so berry my yorkie , didn't really care for these treats . i think they smell and remind her of her dog food . but on the good side the bag does have plenty small treats , good for training . not too big .

good concept , but too large this was a gift from a friend that used and liked it . i , however , found the spoon part of this too large ( too deep ) for my daughter . now that she's older , it might work , but we feed her thicker foods , and i don't know that they'd squeeze through the dispenser well . i also found it awkward to hold . 
=================
why the malic acid ? i really wanted to love these . i waited so long to try them because of all the thinkfruit varieties , this is the most expensive one . while most of the thinkfruit varieties only have sugar , maybe a little oil , and / or " natural flavors " added , this blueberry variety has malic acid added . i don't know if this is causing the problem for me but the blueberries tasted " off " to me . nothing like a dried blueberry . i looked it up and ( simplified ) , malic acid provides a tart flavor and that's not what i'm tasting . i'm not tasting blueberry either . the only reason i'm not giving this one star is because i can stand them if i rinse them or soak them in something before using them for baking or consuming . once rinsed and soaked , they taste much better , regardless of what i had to soak them in . ( water , juice , amaretto ) the best variety of all of the thinkfruit flavors is the thinkfruit whole cranberries , 1 . 5 ounce bags ( pack of 10 ) in my opinion . they taste just like what you'd expect a dried cranberry to taste like . 
=================
why all the positive reviews ? - - udated . i love it ! this tea is super sour . . . . taste like lemons . it tastes nothing like tea and i don't taste any raspberries . very disappointed . raspberry gardens is so much better . update : oh how wrong i was . i thought this tea was disgusting and put it in the back of my cupboard to never try again . thankfully i tried it again today and made it into an iced tea and sweetened it . it's now my favorite tea . now i know where all the positive reviews are coming from .

good product , terrible price ! my five year old loves this milk and the fact that it is shelf stable means that i can pack it in his school snacks and not worry about it spoiling . . . very handy . but , amazon's price is horrible . what a way to take advantage of people who might live in remote areas without a retail outlet . i buy this at bj's for $ 12 . 79 for a case of 18 and can even get it at whole foods ( you know , of the " whole paycheck " joke ) for $ 14 . 99 . they do have the strawberry milk here , which i've never seen at a retail store , but , fortunately , my son doesn't like it . i did buy it on " sale " for closer to the usual retail price . 
=================
yes the best oj but expensive enough from local stores . in addition to being juiced from the best oranges in the world - - grown on volcanic soil - - this product is " flash pasteurized " which brings it close to fresh - squeezed . people with taste cannot stand american oranges . even those expensive blood oranges , they say , taste nothing like blood oranges . so when i saw this in a local natural food coop , i took some home to feed my family gourmet who has been refusing to eat oranges or drink orange juice for 5 years . it worked . but at $ 6 a bottle in stores , i was hoping to get it cheaper on amazon . nope . for me , uncle matt's orange juice is good enough . also $ 6 and also " flash pasteurized . " but " organic " and twice the size . therefore half the price . if your gourmet thinks it's too sweet , try adding a dash of grapefruit juice on the sly .

you can find cheaper popcorn this popcorn is an ok value , but you can find better value at a national store chain that starts with a w . they sell popcorn for $ 1 . 48 / 2lb . bag , which ends up being a good amount cheaper than this product - $ 9 . 38 for 12 . 5 lbs . 
=================
could be orangier tried this since my usual brand from the coop was so expensive ( $ 10 + ) for the same size . ( make biscotti w / orange & pecan ) first batch was not as " orangie " as i had remembered . the 2nd batch was much better . perhaps exposing the fruit to air gave it more flavor . this s a good ingredient given the price difference between this & my usual brand . 
=================
what a mixture of reviews ! i guess our taste buds are all completely different considering the mixed reviews on this product . myself , i thought the stevia in the raw was pretty good . it was no better or worse than any other sweetner i have tasted . considering it is healthier than the others , i will make it my brand of choice . for one reviewer to call anyone who claims they like stevia in the raw a liar , that is absurd . some people are so mean . many people drink diet coke and i can't stand it , even after trying to like it for years . we all have different taste buds , obviously . that is not a lie !

no salty taste i was recently told i needed to reduce salt for health reasons and i was so haapy to get the table tasty and try it . there is a dash of mixture of vegetable taste , however no salt taste . i was very dissappointed .

one spoiled can spoils the batch initially my cats loved all three flavors of this fancy feast product . then i got a box that had one badly deformed and bulging can ; obviously bacteria were growing in it . i didn't even open it - just threw it away . i called the company to inform them . they asked for the production number from the can and sent me coupons for 4 free cans . wonderful , as far as it goes , but that entire batch must have been bad because the cats would not touch any of the chicken - flavored cans remaining in the box . so i'm out eight cans , not just the four replaced . these things happen , but i can't afford to throw away money like that , so if it happens again , i will not be buying fancy feast . in the meantime , the cats love the beef first , and turkey comes in a close second .

americolor is good but vendor is questionable i've purchased many different americolor gel colors and am happy with them when they are fresh . i purchased 7 bottles from this tcp vendor and 5 of them were old , one even had a use by date of one year before my order ! working with tcp to get a refund has not been as pleasant as working directly with amazon . i finally did get a refund but only for the product , not the shipping charges . the products were old and unusable . i am very disappointed with this vendor and will purchase my colorants from another more reliable source . americolor is good tcp is not . the two yellows i ordered from tcp were good and fresh and the student pack that shipped directly from amazon was good and fresh . i'm happy with these colors but will not order again from tcp because of the other 5 old colors .

great rice biscuits , but be aware of expiration date ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! my 12 month old loves these biscuits as a treat , they're very similar in texture to the baby mum - mums . very little mess with these also . however please be aware that amazon will not resolve the issue if the biscuits are close to the expiration date on the box . my order arrived nov 4th and the biscuits expire on 6th feb next year . not likely that i'll be giving my son more than one of these per day , so biscuits will go to waste . amazon will not accept returns , refund , partial refund , or replace the product . they will do nothing . i asked if this would be the case if the expiration was one month after receiving them and the consultant said " yes " ! sucky policy you have there , amazon . i'll be buying these elsewhere in future .

stays a bit too crunchy tastes great , has lots of fiber , lots of protein , and stays crunchy all the way through the bowl . but , it stays a bit too crunchy . this morning , i found a marble - sized , tightly - packed , super - hard piece of " crunch " in my bowl and removed it right away . unfortunately , my next spoonful had more of this hard cereal in it . and , when i tried to chew it , my tooth broke in half . ouch ! sorry , but no cereal should break your tooth , ever ! it's very unfortunate because i ate a bowl of this every day , it's good for me , and i actually liked it . but , i need my teeth for a few more years . eat at your own risk !

false advertising for some strange reason you and college inn have been leading customers to believe that the product thai coconut curry would be available for purchase . it has been months and it has not shown up in stores or on amazon except as back - ordered . it would be reasonable for you to give some approximation as to when it mightm be available . some comment would be appreciated . long time customer , george chace

this used to be much better feline pine recently changed the formula to make it " 2x absorbent . " that also means it disintegrates twice as fast and now i have litter dust everywhere in my house . if you don't mind it in your bed , in the kitchen , on the furniture , and on your clothes , this litter is for you . it hides the odor better than any other litter - period . fyi , this is the second set of cats i'ved used feline pine with so i've been a customer for over 15 years . i just vacuumed yesterday and there's litter dust on my dresser , on the sofa and on the floor . i've bought my last bag of feline pine . what a shame .

made on shared equipment with other allergens . we bought these for my child who has anaphylaxis to nuts and dairy . we get the product home to find out there is a shared equipment warning . it says all preventative measures taken , etc . but if you're not comfortable giving your child shared equipment food you may want to know that up front . it would have been nice if they posted that part of the ingredient label on amazon .

bland this product is billed as an all natural anti - oxident and electrolyte replacing beverage . sort of like all - natural gatorade with anti - oxidents . like a sports beverage , it too is also kinda bland . i love some of the gatorade flavors , some not so much . this drink falls into the not so much category for me . it is sorta sweet , sorta pineapple - y , and also sorta bland . my wife commented that it has a slippery feel in her mouth , like the glass had soap in it still . i didn't think it was that bad but the drink really didn't appeal to me . in the end , yes , this drink is probably much better for you than a glass of apple juice and definitely better than some sugar infused punch . but as a sports drink , i think i'll stick with plain old gatorade ; it's cheaper and contains fewer calories per serving . if going the all natural route with your juices / drinks is of the utmost importance this may be something to consider and bump this review to 3 stars .

delicious mix ! i first experienced chai yrs ago in a mom - and - pop near eastern / mediterranean restaurant , and i commented on how good it was . the lady working at the time said " we're pakistani , we know how to make it ! " since moving from the area , i've been buying it from chain cafes and whatever powder or liquid concentrate was available at the store . ( i never did get the hang of brewing it from a bag . ) i was reasonably satisfied w / the old general foods ( white can ) recipe . . . didn't taste like the authentic stuff , but still good . i decided to look online after buying my last can ( tan ) of general foods and having to dump it out . it's the only kind my grocery has . ( i actually thought i'd used bad milk w / the first cup . . . but it had the same bad flavor w / fresh milk . i figured they'd changed the recipe , which i'm certain of after reading amazon reviews . ) i ended up choosing a single can of david rio tiger spice and one of elephant vanilla ( which i haven't tried yet . ) wow ! ! ! the tiger spice is by far the closest i've tasted to that first cup in the restaurant . it's lightly sweet but not too sweet , and the spices are bold without having overpowering amounts of cardamom or cloves . i'm liking the ingredient list too ( being aware that powdered creamer isn't perfect ) . david rio : cane sugar , creamer , honey granules , black tea powder , natural spice blend , natural flavors . general foods : sugar , nondairy creamer , maltodextrin , instant tea , & lt ; 2 % of natural and artificial flavor , sodium citrate , modified cornstarch , silicon dioxide .

great assortment my 35 pack just arrived and i had opened it worried because some of the reviews had been so negative . well i don't know if something has changed since then , but this was such a great deal . exactly what i had been hoping for . they came in a sturdy box and no damage was done to any of the k - cups . it's random for sure , so results may vary from mine but i got : 21 different varieties . no more than two of the same flavor . gmc : 2 pumpkin spice , 2 southern pecan , 2 spicy eggnog , 2 blue mountain blueberry , 2 mocha nut fudge , 1 gingerbread , 1 hazelnut , 2 french vanilla decaf ( this is my only gripe , i was under the impression there would be no decaf ) gloria jeans : 2 french vanilla supreme , 2 mudslide , 1 hazelnuttimothy's : 2 kahlua , 1 cinnamon pastry , 1 mocha java , 1 decaf hazelnutwolf gang puck : 2 creme caramel , 2 hawaiian hazelnut , 2 jamaica me crazy , 1 vanilla , donut house , 2 chocolate glazed donut , 2 cinnamon rollall in all , brilliant ! like i said , my only issue and the reason i was gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was the decaf thrown in . it won't get drank at my house . the 24 pack says caffeinated only , the 35 pack doesn't specify but it surely implied it would be the same type of assortment . it looks like a lot of the 35 boxes have a few decaf thrown in , so watch out for that if you mind it .

adams flea and tick dip this is not the same adams flea and tick dip of days gone by . the old formula was quite effective and got rid of ticks after 2 dippings on my dog maggie . my grandson's dog king is plagued with ticks because of the surrounding area that we live in . he's taken for walks along the street with woods and a lake and gets re - infested quite quickly . it has helped , but is not 100 % effective . now he scratches all the time and i have ordered some stop itch shampoo and conditioner to see if this helps . we even tried advantix that did not help get rid of the ticks either . we shall go back to the preventic collar . maybe a bubble suit or space suit would be the solution . " white american eskimo dog in a bubble / space suit walks the outer perimeter of miami florida along the lake and woods to keep out ticks " . we use advantage for fleas and he is flea free 100 % .

yummy these lollipops are so tasty ! i love that different flavors such as mango and pomegranate are included , and even the " standard " flavors like cherry and grape are better than regular ones . not to mention that they don't have anything artificial in them ! : ) these candies are pretty small . i believe 3 of them make one serving size , which is good because you can either eat another one if you want or just stick to one without feeling guilty about eating it ! also , the number of each flavor is roughly equal , but they aren't mixed up . when i opened mine , all the grapes were in the front , the cherry behind those , etc . i had to dump them all out to try apple d : but once i dumped them out they were mixed up : dall in all , i think these lollipops are worth a try . they taste good , come in new and different flavors ( like mango and pomegranate ) , and are completely natural ( even the color dyes ! ) . they definitely aren't worse than regular lollipops , so you might as well get these and save yourself from all the weird things that lollipops usually contain . 
=================
as expected i'm a novice when it comes to bonsai . i have purchased an elm and juniper and both arrived well packaged and healthy . actually , the packaging was a little tough because they were tightly wrapped with some kind of plastic wrap . and although i'm not an expert it's hard for me to testify that the juniper is actually 4 years old . to my amateur eyes it looks to be much younger . the elm has lost a few leaves yellowing and falling but after a few internet searches i learned why this is happening . the pots were as i expected and i believe them to be of nice quality . the box also had a green bottle of fertilizer which i wasn't expecting but it was nice and i appreciate it . i think it would have been better if the seller would have included a complementary brochure for bonsai related products such as humidity trays . the reason i say this is because i am a novice and upon initially ordering i had no clue that such things were needed to help bonsai thrive . at least with a complementary brochure i could have looked through it and say " hmm , what is a humidity tray for ? " and would have gotten around to getting a few sooner . i have had both bonsai for almost two weeks and neither appear to be dying or on the fringes of dying . and considering this is winter it's supposed to be the dormant season so i don't expect much activity until spring . i would buy again from this seller .

agree with joe compute i agree with joe . . . . this is ridiculous . not like the other good buys on amazon . you can buy it like he said for around $ 6 . 00 or less on sale so why would anyone pay this much on here . i don't drink it but felt a comment was needed here about the price .

the failed my chihuahua taste test i have a rather picky chihuahua when it comes to dog food . she eats the generic brands reluctantly but at least finishes every bite . with this blue buffalo chicken and rice meal , she leaves the dark morsels alone . i once had to leave nothing but the dark morsels for a day for her to eat any and she only did it because she was so hungry . i like that the ingredients are healthy . however , it still means half of the bag is wasted with her avoiding the dark morsels whenever she can . one star deducted for me having wasted about half the bag because my dog is so picky . 
=================
delicious taste , but you pay a premium to substitute fructose for sucrose i eat this jam occasionally with peanut butter on crackers , and it is quite tasty . while it is less unhealthy than other sugary jams , i don't deceive myself that it won't raise blood sugar , because it is essentially 100 % fructose , which is just as capable of raising blood sugar as sucrose ( white / table sugar ) - - more on this below . most people buy this product as a presumed health food due to it being lower in sugar than other jams . it's ingredients are : " juice concentrate ( pear , grape ) , strawberries , maltodextrin ( dietary fiber ) , fruit pectin , citric acid , natural flavor . " this product contains no artificial sweeteners , which are associated with various health hazards . this product's primary claim to fame is that it is , as the label states , " sweetened only with fruit juice . " any jam will have its sweetener listed first , meaning that is its primary ingredient . if you are on a low - carb diet or diabetic , you might want to know that this jam basically substitutes fructose for sucrose . since fructose is twice as sweet as sucrose , the producers only need to use half as much as they would have of sucrose , so it has about half the calories of regular jam . ( on the other hand , many cheap jams contain high - fructose corn syrup - - but that's another health issue entirely . ) the problem for many people is that they are used to the taste of sucrose , and 100 % fructose tastes very different from a combination of fructose and sucrose which is the case with regular jam made with white sugar . to my own taste , since i'm eating a fruit spread , it tastes quite sweet enough to me . the fruit pectin in this product is a standard thickener in jellies and jams and its own natural form of fiber , so i am not sure why the company decided to add in maltodextrin and call that " fiber " too . anyone with a gluten intolerance should be wary of this product because of the maltodextrin since some people with gluten intolerance are getting sick from the maltodextrin in this jam . the producers claim on the label it is " gluten - free , " but maltodextrin can be made from either wheat or corn , and apparently this company is not being careful enough about contamination with gluten . another ingredient that is problematic as to how healthy this product can be is the " natural flavor . " it is possible that the producers add a strawberry extract so they can get away with using less real strawberries , which are more expensive than a flavoring . the definition of natural flavor under the code of federal regulations is : " the essential oil , oleoresin , essence or extractive , protein hydrolysate , distillate , or any product of roasting , heating or enzymolysis , which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice , fruit or fruit juice , vegetable or vegetable juice , edible yeast , herb , bark , bud , root , leaf or similar plant material , meat , seafood , poultry , eggs , dairy products , or fermentation products thereof , whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional " ( 21cfr101 . 22 ) . that essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food , but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is .

i love this water , but the price . . . the price is too expensive on this , and it's bottled in the u . s . there are 128 oz in a gallon . so this purchase amts to a gallon and a half . can you actually pay $ 35 for a 1 . 5 gallons of water when you can get a gallon at your grocers for . 99 cent ? though this is alkaline and has more minerals in it , it doesn't justify the price esp . if you are going to continue eating acidic foods you're better off putting baking soda in your water or just taking tums .

works but does not taste very good this coffee has a decent amount of caffeine , but it's difficult even for me to drink , and i drink black coffee every day . this stuff reminds me of the icky folgers stuff i drank every day in high school before i realized that coffee could taste good . maybe it's just this flavor and not the brand , so i may consider trying another flavor in the future , though i'll probably keep trying out other brands a bit more before trying eight o'clock again .

doesnt work for medium size insects - they just walk right thru it i seem to have develop a new roach problem recently , so got this based on the " fantastic " reviews and price . it seems to have only caught small bugs like silver fish or 1 / 4 inch spiders . one day i saw a spider crawling around ; i put the box in front of it and it didnt go in at first and turned around . then i moved the box again in its path and it ran right through it ! so much for a trap . . . its more like a walk in a park with some sticky puddle of goob for these critters . i had good luck with using roach motel a long time ago . will try it again .

poor amazon pricing while i like this coffee in the same way that many other reviewers have already articulated , amazon's usual top pricing is way off . not only has the availability been poor , but i'm buying this package for less than $ 10 . 00 from one of the many coffee pod / disc internet providers . amazon almost always has the best ( lowest ) pricing ! what is wrong in this category ?

post - consumer waste . . . in my quest to find new and exciting cereals for my morning wakeup , i stumbled across a mega - box of waffle crisp at the grocery store yesterday and just had to snatch it up . i love waffles ( who doesn't ) and so i just had to try this . what starts off rather delicious turns to mush very quickly , so if you tend to take your time eating your breakfast ( which is the case with me since i work from home and eat while i work ) then this can turn off - putting rather quickly . the maple flavor ( which is the best part of the waffle experience ) is subtle enough to not be overly sweet , but it is also subtle enough to be mistaken for something else entirely . in fact , this tasted a lot like cookie crisp at first , which is not what i was wanting . my milk was rather delicious in the end , so there is always that . i can't say that i'm all that impressed really . i wanted to be , and i expected to be , but at the end of the day ( or should i say ` morning' ) i'm left with some mushy mini - sponges swimming in lightly flavored maple milk .

poor product description on unilever & amazon's behalf had amazon written in its " product features " that ultra shea nourishing balm was intended for relaxed and natural hair , i would have known better ( buzz words for ethnic hair ) . unfortunately i took amazon's brief description ( scalp dryness ) at face value . only when the package arrived were the words " relaxed / natural " clearly visible on the jar . one look at the product confirmed that this is not intended for caucasians with dry hair . the first four ingredients listed are petrolatum , mineral oil , paraffin and lanolin wax . instead of posting those ingredients which might have helped online consumers better understand what they are purchasing , amazon describes the above ingredients as part of a " nutrium 10 moisture lock system . " who should i blame , unilever or amazon , for such lousy advertising ? i'm certainly unqualified to review a product clearly not made for my hair type . my jar of clear scalp & hair therapy nourishing balm will be passed on to someone who can appreciate its use . i give low ratings for inadequate product description , not performance . in the right hands , it's probably a wonderful and useful product . please rewrite a more clear product description to alleviate all this confusion .

tastes good but some ingredients questionable this product does taste good , and it only contains 5 calories from 1 gram of sugar . it takes 2 or 3 minutes to completely dissolve , but that's not a problem . what is confusing / questionable are some of the ingredients . among others listed are " sucralose ( sweetner ) , maltodextrin ( corn ) , . . . isomalt " . what are these things ? two of them appear to be malt products and the other an artificial sweetner . is this maltodextrin ( corn ) similar to high fructose corn syrup ? also , at the very bottom of the " nutrition facts " , apart from the ingredients list , 10 mg of caffeine per 8 fl oz serving ( 2 servings / packet " is also mentioned . when only 1 / 2 packet ( one serving per the package ) is added to 8 fluid ounces of water , the taste is definitely watered down . 
=================
who cares what color it is ? my family has loved this cereal for years . i recently read the packaging and have discovered that it contains artificial colors . we are trying to avoid eating foods with artificial coloring in them . please reconsider quaker ? we don't care what color it is !

priced right and palatable first let me say that i wish i could tolerate apple juices that taste more like cider . i can't ; that's that . this juice , which probably has some white grape juice in it , is okay ; and the price is fine with me . i doubt that everyone would think it superbe , but there's no arguing about taste . right ? anyway , it suits me and my digestive system .

difficult to apply and ineffective for squirrels ! the product label says to apply at the rate of 1 lb . per 40 square feet . impossible to measure the rate of application and when using the narrowest opening on the spout the 5 lbs . were gone in about 50 square feet ( ? ? ? ) . if it had some color to it you could a least see where you've been with it but as it is it blends in with the grass so well you can't tell . i used it to circle my peach trees to keep the varmints away and so far it appears to be helping but it will be very expensive to have to reapply every rain . i think i will look for a cheaper alternative or i will have the most expensive peaches in the country . this is a follow up to my review . it has been about 4 days since i sprinkled the product around the base of the peach trees . it has not rained but today i was watching the squirrels running through the " protected " area without even noticing it as they continued stealing my peaches . so much for that idea ! 
=================
caveat i must say up front i have not tried these noodles . i ordered them and , when they arrived , i opened the box to find bags of white , squigly things suspended in a clear fluid ( water ) . it looked like something i would order from an elementary science teacher's supply catalog . so i set it on my counter and spent a week trying to get past the way they look . i visited the web site again . i read the - good - reviews . but the bottom line , for me , is that they look repulsive . on day 7 , they went into the trash . i have a similar issue with barilla plus . i think they taste fine , but they look very unappetizing to me after they are cooked . if you are trying to find a good noodle ( pasta ) alternative , try dreamfields . it's real pasta ; it tastes like real pasta ; it looks like pasta ; it's good quality pasta . but it has a higher fiber content , which makes it more filling and lowers the glycemic index . you'll never know you're not eating regular old pasta . 
=================
great cookie ; your pricing is way off the cookies are wonderful . my grandkids love them . your company however is insane . to charge over $ 25 . 00 per pack is not going to win you any clients . i can buy the cookies for far less at my local grocery store . i'm making sure everyone i know sticks with their local store and not your overpriced company . one shopper i know said if amazon is that expensive for cookies i can get so much less expensively , then i won't even use them for other items . jeff , you need to take a hard look at this one before it really affects your bottom line .

best ever treats these freeze - dried liver treats from pooch passions are the best ever . my little shih tzu and lhaso apso love the flavor and texture . they race to their beds at the end of the day to get pooch passions treats . ( i used gimborn beef liver treats and wasn't satisfied with them . i even wrote the company when the quality of the treats deteriorated and over half of a bucket would be unusable . ) the quality of pooch passions liver treats is consistently high . these pooch passions treats can be cut in half for tiny little guys like mine . i'm 100 % satisfied and recommend these without reservation . pet test them yourself with your dog and you'll soon be buying them in the large 21 ounce bags as i do . best ever treats ! ! ! !

price reality - list price is really about $ 16 almost purchased - thought that mints that retail for 10 + dollars for a single tin must be pretty good , and amazon was offering 88 % off . . . but in reality the list price is grossly inflated . . . it should not be $ 89 . 94 , but rather just under $ 16 , which makes the discount about 33 % . maybe will still buy , but this is not the bargain it seems . ( rating based on the other review , since amazon will not allow me to skip the rating )

it used to be good but not anymore ! update ! my guess is natural balance has recently changed their chicken & pea l . i . d ( limited ingredient diet ) formula , or their factory has been using different replacement or substandard ingredients ! i have been feeding the chicken & pea l . i . d to my cats for months now & they have been doing great off of it as you can see from my previous review on this product . then , in mid february 2012 , i opened a new bag for my cats and the coloring of the crunchies were a much darker color than they used to be & my cats wouldn't even eat it ! so i went and purchased a new bag from a different store to see if the 1st bag was just a bad batch & this time the crunchies looked normal , however within a week , one of my cats got blood covered stool ( which took 3 months to go away ! ) , and my cat with the sensitive stomach started acting mopey & sick . after 2 weeks he would barely walk around . several tests later the vet found that his intestines were swollen along with his stomach lymph nodes & he had developed pancreatitis . he's off the food now but still recouping . apparently my cat isn't the only one with problems recently with the limited ingredient dry crunchies according to reviews on consumeraffairs . com ! customers on there have the same complaints with the cat & dog dry l . i . d food over the past few months of it doing the same thing to their animals too ! natural balance doesn't have my business any more , that is until they no longer have diamond pet foods package their products . after doing some background research on natural balance , diamond pet foods ( who packages for them ) has constant recalls & complaints . they have one going on right now actually & were one of the biggest culprits during the 2007 major pet food recall . just keep an eye on your pets if you purchase this , and also watch for a runny nose or sneezing , my cat no longer does either since taking him off of this food . original review : five stars ! ! ! ! one of my cats has a very sensitive stomach but does very well on these crunchies ! and my other cat had bad dandruff but after a couple of months on this food its completely gone ! her coat looks beautiful and she doesn't frantically lick her back anymore ! both of my cats seemed to prefer this flavor over the salmon l . i . d but all cats are different . so glad natural balance makes this !

good x - bold dark roast for the price really my title sums up my opinion of this cup altogether . it does make a nice , heart large cup of dark roast coffee , and $ 25 for 48 cups as the preorder price was outstanding . at that price , i don't think i've ever really seen better , but at the same time the brew doesn't seem quite as bold or earthy tasting as a cup of green mountain dark magic or emeril's big easy bold . i prefer a robust large cup on almost every brew , and i've realized that even the ice brew k - cups are basically the same thing ; a cup of coffee with extra grounds for brewing a small amount stronger . . . so i brew iced coffee with my extra bold k - cups . i did the math on weight , and these weigh in at just under a cup of dark magic or sumatran reserve , but i'd still say my favorites ( by taste , ) are the brands i've listed above or tully's italian or french roast , caribou obsidian , starbucks dark sumatra , or even barista prima french and italian roasts . the only other thing i can note about these is that the construction of the pods is about perfect ; i didn't find any grinds in the box leaving me to believe there were no leaking pods . almost all the pods had a little air puffing the foil out ; which i've noticed a lot of the keurig brands have flat foils , anyways , so i'm not even sure if it matters that much , although i've had grinds brew through on some of the flat pods . the only other difference i can mention is the material of the foil top is different than keurig brand pods ; these are slightly harder and smoother ( almost like a plastic or polymer , ) but it doesn't seem to effect the brew process at all , and i didn't seem to get any grinds in my cup , so all in all it just doesn't matter to me . still better than brewing through a regular coffee pot ( even from fresh ground beans , ) and i don't think i'll ever get tired of my keurig coffee maker .

great rubber ball , flawed treat design we've had this for about a week now . i have a 1 year old beagle that destroys ever furry " super strong " soft toy , but he isn't interested in a lot of hard toys like tires , etc . we got this hoping that his food motivation would keep him occupied with a toy he can't tear apart . the good : * it is very durable . he hasn't even managed to put a dent it . * we stuck a treat inside it , which is impossible for him to remove . he will happily spend several hours occupied trying to get it out . yaaay ! the ugly : * it took him about 20 mins to pop the regular " everlasting " treat out . without the ball to protect it , it's a 10 minute treat . : - ( he can do this every time now .

too sweet for me ! this drink - when mixed up - looks and smells quite a bit like lemonade . but once you taste it , you'll find this isn't like any lemonade you've had before . the drink is very sweet - too sweet for me . ( my family and i drink very few sweet drinks , and rarely buy and soft drinks or mix up kool - aid - type drinks . while i do this for personal health reasons , i have to be fair and admit that my taste buds do not find very sweet drinks very likeable . so , while i am biased against this type of drink , if you enjoy very sweet drinks , you'll probably find it more to your liking . ) when my wife and kids tasted this , they also found it to be too sweet for them . my wife actually dumped out the rest of her drink after one sip and said there was no way she was drinking anything that sweet ! we recently also tried the crystal light mocktails appletini , 1 . 69 - ounce ( pack of 4 ) , and we thought that drink was ok - better than this drink . perhaps the developers at crystal light can tone down the sweetness and add in a bit of tartness , instead , and i'd like it better . as it is now , i really can't recommend it to anyone .

very small capacity , takes too long to use , hard to clean . i won the beaba from a blog giveaway , but i don't think i would ever spend the money to buy one . i only used mine about a dozen times before passing it on to a friend . it did everything it was advertised to do . i don't think it saves on time and effort , though . you still have to clean , peel , and cut your fruits or veggies into chunks , so no time saved there . if anything it takes more time to prepare baby food with the beaba simply because it has such a small capacity . you can put about a cup to a cup and a half of chopped raw food in the steamer , which seems like a good amount of food . however , by the time you steam and puree your food , you end up with only about half a cup of baby food , maybe a bit more . let's say you're going to make some sweet potatoes . always a great food to start babies on because it's mild and sweet and can be pureed really smooth and creamy . the beaba can only cook about half of an average sweet potato at a time . i can cook four large sweet potatoes and puree them in my 7 - cup food processor all at once . with the beaba , start to finish , from peeling to chopping to steaming to blending to cooling , you're looking at around 30 to 45 minutes before you can feed your baby . also , food coming out of the beaba is extremely hot , rightly so , but you can't feed a baby food that hot so you have to let it cool , which just adds to your food prep time . anyone who is serious about making most or all of their own baby food is going to want to make baby food in bulk . most busy moms don't have time to waste on a product like the beaba that makes such a small amount of food at a time . just one hour in the kitchen on sunday and i had enough baby food to last all week , if not longer . i have a kitchenaid 7 - cup food processor which i found on sale at bb & b for around sixty bucks . i would steam my veggies and fruits on the stove or even in the microwave , then puree them quickly in the food processor , usually making about 4 cups of baby food at a time . also , one pot , one steamer basket , and one food processor was much easier to clean than the beaba . the beaba streamer basket was stained orange the first time i used it and i didn't care for all the little parts and pieces i needed to clean on the beaba . don't waste your money on fancy or expensive baby food storage containers . gladware makes small 4 - ounce containers . i believe a pack of 8 is under 3 bucks . i would fill about a dozen of these at a time with 3 or 4 different foods and pop them in the freezer . each night before i went to bed , i would pull a couple of containers out of the freezer and stick them in the fridge for the next day . come mealtime , it was fast and easy to scoop out what i needed and warm it up in the microwave . after several months of freezing and heating the little blue lids of the gladware containers would crack , but they're so affordable that i didn't mind tossing some in the recycling bin and buying another set .

these are awesome chocolates , however my 2 bags of dark chocolate covered pomegranate came to me melted into two blocks of chocolate and pomegranate . of course , this also means that the chocolate was dried out . i am going to see if my costco still carries these candies and not buy them by mail again , if i can help it . the box they were shipped in was not even labeled as to special handling of the contents . very poor shipping , amazon . the product gets 5 stars . the ( super saver ) shipping and handling gets no stars . i guess i got what i paid for . ellen

taste before buying a pack of 12 ! my husband loves lifesavers and even though my daughter thought orange mints sounded disgusting i thought these sounded pretty good . there were only six reviews , but since they were all five stars i decided to order the pack of 12 orange mint lifesavers . big mistake ! my daughter put it best when she said they taste like orange medicine . also , why do these contain aspartame ? they aren't sugar free . if you've tasted these and love them , then you should buy them . definitely try these before you buy a pack of 12 .

best energy drink . bad price i love monster energy drink , but the $ 47 . 89 price for a case is not a good deal . it comes to about $ 2 per can , which is just slightly below what you can buy a single can for at a convenient store . i thought i would find a better deal buying large quantities over the internet , but i guess not . the best deal i have found is 7 - 11 , where a 4 - pack can be had for $ 6 . that's only $ 1 . 50 per can .

two paws down my ten pound yorkie is very food centric when it comes to games - if there isn't food , he isn't playing . we have several bumble balls and kongs that he loves to play with and thought this treat wheel would be a fun new game for him . the yellow playing pieces were much too big for him to get his mouth around and he was unable to master using his paws to flip them out of the holders . for a dog that loves any game that involves food , this just proved much too frustrating for him . and believe me , we tried to help our little guy out with this . we left the yellow cups off and just slightly rotated the wheel , but even that was too difficult for him to " spin " as it did not move easily . and it's not like our dog isn't " paw - centric " as he is actually quite adept at using his paws to move and flip his kong , and to fish treats out from under furniture , etc . we tried over the course of several weeks to try and help our pal get the hang of this toy , but all parties finally agreed that this just wasn't fun the way a toy should be . perhaps if you have a bigger dog this will work for you , but it received two paws down from our little buddy . one other concern that i had was the fact that the small hole in the top of the yellow cups seemed just the right opening for a dog to catch a nail in and get stuck on his paw . granted that on one should ever leave a pet and a toy unattended , but something for people to keep in mind if they do buy this product . ( yes i'm a worry wart pet parent , but you'd be amazed at the predicaments our pets have gotten themselves into . . . )

good product you know i would have given this item 5 stars except for the fact that when my package arrived , one of the bottles was opened . the coconut oil is very easily turned into a liquid , and because of this , my package was all slippery and slimy . now i should have returned it but i was too lazy to return so i kept it . the bottle that was not opened was fine and was exactly what i wanted . so besides one of my coconut oil bottles being opened and leaking a little which lead to me throwing it away , all else was fine .

taste the chemicals , not the beef i should have the read the label more carefully , but the packaging and talk of montana took me in . made in the usa means that beef was turned into jerky in the usa , not the cattle were necessarily raised in the usa , though they might have been . but the real complaint is the flavor , which seems to be the taste of preservative and msg with some hard - to - identify spice and unconvincing hickory flavor . this is a relatively dry jerky which you have to chew - - but that's a good thing in my view since that's how " real " jerky is . but " real " jerky isn't overcome with preservatives and enhancers .

response to previous review about ingredients hi troy , i want to apologize that nobody from octavia tea responded to your request for information ! i work for octavia tea , and it appears that we did not receive your email . octavia tea specializes in certified organic teas , which means all of the ingredients ( teas , herbs , flowers , fruits , pure essential oils and natural flavors ) we use must meet rigorous demands for quality and purity . certified organic products are free from chemicals , antibiotics , synthetic hormones , genetic modifications and sewage sludge , and are minimally processed without artificial ingredients or preservatives in order to maintain the integrity of the food and preserve the environment . the rules are so strict , in fact , that certain ingredients and flavors that considered " natural " are not natural enough to be approved for use in organic products . therefore , our pomegranate white tea is one of the purest forms of tea available . it is made from only 5 basic ingredients : 100 % organic white tea , 100 % organic rise hips , 100 % organic hibiscus , 100 % organic safflower petals and natural ( organic approved ) pomegranate flavor . the natural flavors used in certified organic products must meet strict requirements put forth by the national organic program ( nop ) . we must obtain documentation from our flavor suppliers to verify that the flavors and pure essential oils used in some of our teas are non - synthetic and have not been produced using artificial preservatives or synthetic solvents . fortunately , buying certified organic products means that nothing can be hidden . we sell our teas to many customers with allergies . therefore , all of the ingredients used in this tea are printed on the product label . if this response does not answer your questions , i encourage you to call the toll - free number ( listed on our website ) so we can provide you with the answers you need . we are a small business with a limited office staff , but our customers are important to us and we try to respond to every phone call we receive . i hope this information helps !

horribly bitter . . . but yeah , chocolatey i love dark chocolate . i don't even bother with milk chocolate much since i turned 40 , cause dark is where it's at ! i love valrhona , and i've also bought other high end chocolates over the past decade over at my gourmet shop or fresh market . i even love those chocolate truffles that are the store brand at whole foods ( 365 brand ) . but i've been moving into organic foods ( and preferably local when possible ) over the last year plus . one of the things i decided to do was try to replace my fave chocolate snacks with equivalent organic ones , including chocolate cookies . well , i tried this high cocoa content of green and black's and their mint chocolate bar . i threw out both before i finished them . neither did it for me . i really find them to be highly bitter . not bitter as in the normal bitterness that a high cocoa content has . a really unpleasant bitterness , like coffee that's sat too long in the carafe . i've tried a couple other organic chocolates i picked at random at whole foods and have yet to find one that makes me go , " yes , this is it ! " green and black's 70 % is soooo not it . so , fwiw , that has been my experience with g & b , which as you can see differs from the previous commenters who love it . ymmw . back to valrhona . mir

worst goji berries i've ever bought they are crunchy and dissolve when you bite them . of course , this also affects the taste . in the past , i've bought many varieties while living in europe , where goji berries are wide - spread . they should be slightly chewy . will not be buying again . - - as an update , the first bag i bought was crunchy . the second bag that came in the package was a bit more chewy , but still stale . but because the quality doesn't seem to be consistent , i will be trying other brands - - so i tried the sunfoods goji berries on amazon . they are great and not stale at all . the downside is that the sunfoods currently cost twice the amount as the navitas , but the bag lasts me 3 months and the extra taste and freshness is well worth it . they even taste good out of the bag , which is not something i could claim with navitas . i'll definitely not be going back to navitas .

if used properly , safer brand effectively controls moths not too long ago , our daughter arrived at our house after a year away from home with bags full of clothes that were full of moths . to this day , she rejects that notion that she brought such a scourge to our family home , but the facts speak for themselves . the day before our daughter arrived home , there was not a moth to be found . the day after she landed and unceremoniously dumped her bags in the front hall closet , i opened the door to that same closet and turned on the light only to be met by the frantic flutterings of a newly arrived population of moths that were scurrying as quickly as their little dusty wings could take them into the dark corners , away from my dropped jaw and curses . i took action immediately . first , i closed the door , hoping for containment . second , i gently scolded my daughter with the reminder that , unlike her , we actually enjoyed the pleasure of a clean , vermin - free home . third , i went online to check out the relative safety of the more toxic insecticides such as " moth crystals " that kill everything - - adults , larva , and eggs . fourth , i decided that i could not seal the hall closet tightly enough to prevent toxic fumes of the conventional insecticides from entering our living space ; fifth , i searched for safer alternatives and found . . . you guessed it . . . safer brand 7270 clothes moth alert trap . i read the mixed reviews for safer brand . many were promising , but some were halfhearted . having wrestled with all manner of crawling interlopers in my home ( lice , fleas , etc . ) , i concluded that the less enthusiastic reviews were most likely a result of user error or , at the very least , the purchaser's own lack of diligence in follow through after correctly applying the product . i , on the other hand , am one of those classic obsessive compulsive types who takes on a challenge like this with the determination of a marathon runner ( make that " triathlete " ) . my husband would smirk at such an analogy since the only experience i have that even approximates exercise is the vigorous typing i do on my computer ; but , hey , one finds analogies where one can , right ? so , on with the story . after reading the instructions and carefully positioning about three traps in every closet of my home , i also followed up with a thorough vacuuming of each closet and put the more seductive wool / silk items into thick , black , plastic bags ( the kind you get at the hardware store that are usually called " contractor's bags " ) . i also installed a third tier of defense by placing a few bowls of cedar balls in each closet . finally , i left one small wool scrap hanging in each closet to lure the moths . i am nothing if not devious . then , i waited . in fact , i was gone for several weeks on vacation , and when i returned , much moth activity had occurred . the verdict ? the traps worked wonderfully when combined with my other " moth attack " measures . the corpses of dead , desiccated moths littered the traps . there were no holes or visible eggs on the wool " lure , " but i disposed of those scraps just to be safe . then , i continued to search for moths in the less accessible parts of the closet - - higher up on the walls , in the seams between carpet and baseboard , and in all the ceiling corners . i found no moth activity . i replaced the first batch of traps with a second round after a few months , and i continue to have zero moths to this day . end of story .

starbucks needn't worry ! i'm a big fan of coffee , so this beverage piqued my interest . i have tried starbucks drinks both at starbucks coffee shops and from the supermarket . i like them . this drink is not as sweet . it seems there's just enough sugar to take the bitter edge off . when ice is added it makes a refreshing enough warm weather beverage , though i have tasted better . what the product has going for it is convenience . the 6 . 8 - ounce cans are easy to store in the refrigerator and can be taken out and drunk quickly . no process of first making iced coffee . that's a definite plus . it is not as satisfying at room temperature . the flavor , apart from being strong , is harsh to the taste and does not provide the satisfaction that a starbucks or other espresso drinks in a can / bottle do . as a pick - me - up , the drink is appropriate , since its hefty dose of caffeine will give the drinker an infusion of energy . compared to other similar drinks on the market , sugar content is low ( which accounts for its bitterness ) . for those averse to caffeine or those who have trouble sleeping if they drink too much brewed coffee , this beverage is a no - no . these days , many folks have cut down on caffeine intake , so this product might be counterproductive to weaning oneself from addictive caffeine .

love nutramigen but do not pay this price i love nutramigen for how it helped my daughter through some difficult times . i used the concentrate cans quite frequently but never paid this much for it . if you can find a local retailer that does " can can " sales ; ) you can find the same for half the price . at least purchase directly through enfamil . this formula is expensive enough as is without this vendor trying to take you for a ride . for shame !

no longer as advertised the first two cases i bought were very satisfactory . i mixed the coconut milk into a shake , along with bananas and cocoa and drank it straight . it was great , very fresh . i could use it on anything : salads , etc . the third case i bought had a completely different texture , smooth and creamy versus the flaky , part solid / part liquid texture of the first two cases . unsure about it , i put a sparing amount in my shake . minutes later , my stomach starting to act up . it couldn't digest this coconut milk properly . my wife's stomach's reaction was even worse than mine . ( i've also had a similar reaction before with another brand of coconut milk , bought much less expensively at an asian grocery ) . so then i looked at the ingredients , and lo and behold , there were at the end : " guar gum , stabilizers . " looking back at the description of this item here on amazon , i see it says " no preservatives . no stabilizers . " i also have found from other reviews that people have discovered the ingredients have changed . a once - great product is no longer , and in fact , is not as advertised .

chia seeds have great effect , but taste is awful so i will confess , i really feel better and more energized on less sleep when i drink one of these , but this particular brand tastes unbelievably bad . as if it had aspartame in it , though it does not list it in the ingredients . i've tried another chia drink ( different brand ) and it was lip - smackingly delicious , so i will surely not buy any more of these . also , the other brand ( found at whole foods - i'll update the name when i remember ) costs about the same or less for 10oz vs the 8oz of this one .

bonsai plant i placed this order along with 2 other plants from the same seller early part of this month . after 3 weeks i noticed the leaves becoming brittle and dry . after receiving the plant i transplanted into a ceramic dish and followed the instructions to keep the soil moist and kept it by the windows with indirect sun . i contacted the seller recently to inquire on what should be done . after sending the seller photos of the plant as it is today the seller agreed to refund if the plant does not recover in a couple of weeks . this is the reason i've rated the seller and this purchase a 4 star based on the seller's customer service . i know i will purchase from this seller again and the other plants i've purchased are doing very well .

fogchaser please read ! ! ! ! ! do not let the bad reviewers drive you away , i almost didn't order these because of them . if you like real coffee not fluffed up flavored coffee but real coffee this is for you . i have tried pretty much every k - cup on the market and the only ones i enjoy are midnight magic and jet fuel . if you like either of these two you will enjoy this cup of coffee . a little about my coffee preference , i mainly enjoy french pressed strong coffees because the flavors are out of this world . i do have a keurig ( christmas gift ) for about 5 years now , sad part is i only use this if i ran out of time in the morning . with all of that said do realize this is not even remotely close to a french press but is now being added to my very small k - cup approval list .

doesn't have the 'corny' taste of regular yellow as has already been noted , the kernels are a bit smaller than the regular yellow variety and , to me anyway , less flavorful . i've been using a west bend microwave popper . the 'pops' are a good deal less robust than the yellow variety when popped by this method . more like 'pfft corn' . the texture has a lot more crunch to it than the pillowy yellow puffs .

the product works but nobody knows how to use it right due to packing issues . okay , based on a you tube video that i found , the product is applied post shower and hair drying / styling . part the hair in sections . rub one finger lighly over the product and then apply directly to the scalp only . repeat only over areas of the scalp needing treatment . minimal product is needed . one jar should last quite awhile and , on the areas i've tested , the product does work . i give this product four - stars because it does work but i'm deducting two stars because the packaging developers failed to communicate instructions and caused way too many people stress and damaged hair . although i do hold the packaging developers accountable for the number of bad reviews , i am dumbfounded at the number of customers who used this product without doing any research as how to properly apply it . a quick web search brings up a video on youtube that would have eliminated frustration and hair damage . not saying that the manufacturer should have neglected to put proper instructions on the jar or attached them somehow . honestly , what if hair loss was the result of mis - application ? if there is computer access available to leave a review . . . the same technology would have avoided the situation that caused the negative review . the negative reviews are justified because of the packaging but why risk the damage when a search engine would have prevented it ? that's all i'm saying .

almonds ? tiny pieces ! are you kidding me ? ! i just ate half of a 4 . 25 ounce hershey's milk chocolate with almonds bar and found zero , zip , - 0 - whole almonds . in fact , i found nothing close to an entire almond . . . the biggest was maybe a third of one half of a single nut ! really ? ! that is nuts ! i am sick of companies cheaping out on consumers . for my entire 58 yr . life , my favorite chocolate , without exception , and including the likes of other crowd favorites like godiva , has been hershey's . but this cost - cutting stuff by hershey's ? how can this be true ? okay , maybe it's acceptable to put " pieces " ( taste like stale floor sweepings ) into halloween - sized very small bars , but , please , not into the larger candy bars that earned hershey's such a great brand name ! keep it up and you will lose customers like me who know quality from crap . charge more but don't listen to the corporate idiots telling you it's okay to sub almond pieces for almonds . please chime in if you know what i am talking about !

be very afraid i am not pleased with this seller at all . i have done business at amazon on multiple occasions , and have always been pleased , if not down - right delighted with the whole process , but this most recent transaction , the purchase of the mexican vanilla totonacs has me extemely , shall we say wary , therefor i must make people aware , as well as amazon . com . i made my purchase last night ( tues . 27th ) and today , at 1 : 29p . m . i received a call from my financial institution for possible fraudulent charges on my account . less than 18 hours from my transaction , to the time my cu had to put a fraud notice on that account . in the 25 minutes it took me to drive into town to get to my cu , another charge had been attempted on it . my recommendation is to not do any business with this company until it's sorted out , since i've never had problems with amazon before this experience . amazon , you may want to verify this group with whom you're doing business , and warn your other customers .

senseo abandons us market apparently , senseo has decided to abandoned the us market . it is nearly impossible to find senseo at any of the traditional retailers , including amazon , walmart , or target . walmart is carrying melitta brand pods that work in the senseo , but the quality is not as good . it is interesting to note amazon continues to list the senseo brand in email blast , but the items are always out of stock . i wrote senseo customer service about the issue , but they failed to respond . i'm going back to costco brand ground coffee and the old reliable mr . coffee or bunn for the morning jolt . i refuse to buy into another expensive pod or k - cup single serve system that changes as often as gillette changes razor blade models .

not good for espresso machine after trying different lavazza espresso whole beans i wanted to give thisone a try and ordered lavazza grand espresso . i have checked the uk andgerman sites to get some idea about the rating for this one since there are not enough reviews for this one . the ratings were not very impressive compareto other lavazza whole beans ( very close to lavazza super crema which ihave ordered through amazon ) but i wanted to make my own experience . when i oppened the package i saw seemingly oily coffee beans compare to other lavazza or illy espresso beans . i have a miele automatic espresso machine which was not very amused abouthis new partner but it was too late to refuse the experiment . grand espresso has a very good crema which is a result of high robusta and normal bucket ( aroma ) . composition 40 % arabica 60 % robusta . as cappuccino i was not very impressed compare to other lavazza espressobeans . it tastes very weak ( i have used whole foods whole milk ) . at the end you get what you have paid for . a lavazza brand which is in thebottom of lavazza whole beans next to lavazza super crema and lavazza tierra . for me the first choice for lavazza espresso is pienaroma if it is fresh ( ihave bought it through amazon for about two years ago which was damaged / sourbut otherwise it is the top choice and the most expencive lavazza in europe ) made from 100 % arabica beans and very espresso machine friendly like all other lavazza beans ( except grand espresso ! ) followed by lavazza top class . for cappuccino my first choice is lavazza top class which has a very nice chocolaty and sweet note followed by none ( even better than illy ) . for me the best espresso is illy dark roast ( unfortunately overpriced ) followed by lavazza pienaroma ( best price / quality ) . for cappuccino i would always go with lavazza top class followed by segafredoextra strong . i would not recommend lavazza grand espresso for espresso machines a la mieleor jura . the fat beans would cause damages for espresso machines . if you have regular / filter coffee machine i would see it comparable to lavazza super crema or tierra ( which i also would definately not buy again ) .

barney butter crunchy almond butter my husband is allergic to peanuts so he can't eat peanut butter - obviously but he can eat this . i had to try this and it does taste pretty much like peanut butter . which is almost too bad , i like almonds and would rather it would taste more like almonds . this is salty like peanut butter too . . . so if you can't digest peanut butter this is the product for you .

nice idea , but can't be used like a regular kitchen bag gets used i love biobags , and use the doggie bags religiously . however , the kitchen bags don't hold up to being stuffed or overstuffed . they stick , rip , leak , and have only worked for me ( i use a simplehuman butterfly step can ) when i double - bag . like the other reviewed said , they would work great if you are just putting compost in , or in my case i use it to line my bedroom trash and that works great . they can't be filled to the max with heavy trash .

purees better than other options i completely agree that this item is pricey but frankly , it purees better than my blender , food mill or cuisinart can . i tried each of the other appliances and while they certainly ground up the food , the consistency was a bit lumpy with each . the babycook actually created a creamy paste out of the food and my little one has loved the food i've made . it's certainly not the only item out there for making baby food but if you have the money and the inclination to make your own baby food , then you really can't go wrong with this product .

honestly little more than water not a whole lot of honest - to - goodness fruit in honest ade . i tried them for the first time yesterday , and was disappointed by just about everything i saw and tasted . it basically tastes like what you get when you finish drinking a glass of fruit juice , then drink water from the glass without rinsing it first . although the bottle is labeled 16 . 9 ounces , i was disappointed to find , when i looked at the bottom of the bottle , that it is acutely concave and pushed in more almost two inches from the bottle's base ; that is , it's one of those " secretly shrinking " packages that looks like it contains a larger quantity than it actually does . a more honest 16 . 9 - ounce bottle could have been about two inches shorter . speaking of honesty , the top ingredients in this drink are water and sugar . there is just enough pom and blueberry juice to color the water a light purple , and no more . there's virtually no nutritional value to the drink , so the pom and blueberry are not in high enough quantities to provide any antioxidants . if you are looking for the benefits of pomegranate and blueberries , buy 100 % real juice , and drink that . then , when you're done drinking it , you can fill up the glass with water and a little sugar , and pretty much get honest ade for free .

no chems ? i've been buying this product for several years after seeing an article in the paper about the maker in oregon . sounds like there are no chemicals in his process . i've never used any other brand , but noticed today that whole foods has both white & black truffle oils from italy . it seemed the prices for us & italian were about the same . my next ingredient for a recipe in 'cuisine at home' is truffle butter for a pasta sauce . they suggest as an added flavor boost to use truffle oil instead of the recipe's olive oil . i'm getting hungry !

like the old formula better my kids have been drinking this milk for years . my older son is essentially a vegetarian , and we have relied on this milk for a big percentage of his daily protein and calcium . he is also a very picky eater , so he noticed immediately the change to low - fat . i know , it has less sugar , but that's a deal - breaker for him . we're willing to let him have that extra sugar , if that's the price we have to pay for him to get his protein . needless to say , we will be looking for a different brand . btw , i know i'm not alone . i started buying this milk on amazon because it would sell out at all the stores in the city i live . now there's a glut of the new low - fat milk at all the stores .

a snack for everyone in the family bought it for a gift . arrived in perfect condition and made a great presentation . there was something in the basket for everyone in the family . products were all the favorite snacks like nuts , cookies , taffy , summer sausage but much more intriguing - the basket was opened immediately so everyone could try a malt shop taffy ( chocolate shake , rootbeer float and cherry cola ! ) . the all natural nuts were fresh and crunchy and the sausage was delicious on its own but even better with the mustard that accompanied it . * i ordered this basket when my wife gave me the task of buying a present for a party . in my quick perusal of amazon , i felt i completed my assignment perfectly . my wife , of course , checked up on my order and was horrified to see i ordered something that received some 1 star reviews . the days were looooong until the package showed up and i was accused , more than once , of not being detail oriented enough . thankfully i was absolutely vindicated when the basket arrived . after reading the other reviewers ( and reading what " vine " was ) clearly there was a mix up with the baskets sent to that program - that seems to happen early so they are the first reviews - which unfortunately caused me agita ( why i am even taking the time to write this ) . i hope no one else will be confused by this very strange situation . and no , if i realized i would have been in the dog house for the shipping period , i wouldn't have picked this item - - however , for the record , i was right .

corn is the # 1 ingredient . . . . purina beneful has not been out for long , but it has become hugely popular ! my sister just switched her dog to it this summer , because he was having some stomach issues ; she thought a new dog food might be a good idea . ( his stomach issues quit right before she switched , though . ) she was feeding purina one chicken & rice dog food , 4 - pound bags ( pack of 6 ) , which is an excellent dog food , with meat as the first ingredient . corn is the first ingredient in beneful . corn is a filler food , and not really good for dogs , cats , ferrets , etc . yet , so many animal feeds have it , including many of the outrageously expensive science diets . and so many pets have eaten corn based food their entire lives , and lived a long , long time . you could go nuts figuring out what to feed your pets ! ( oh , and don't feed your ferrets nuts ! ) personally , i think purina one is a far superior feed over beneful . that's what i feed my cats - - purina one cat smartblend chicken and rice cat food , 16 - pound . ( oh , and my ferrets , too - - purina one kitten growth & dev , 7 - pounds . ) but my sister's dog loves beneful , is doing fine on it , and she's sticking with it right now . she says her dog needed more vegetables . : )

doesn't taste like the real thing this is naturally sweet and tasty , but doesn't taste like real coconut water . tastes vanilla - y as another reviewer has said . this product would be great for those who don't like the taste of real coco water and want a masked taste . i have tried all major brands - - zico , one , and vitacoco . zico in the tetrapak comes closest to tasting like the natural product ( not the zico in the bottles , which tastes great but contains additives - - when a manufacturer changes packaging claiming improved , you can be sure something major has changed ) . but i have received 2 bad cases of zico so am leery to order it again . both bad batches were on sale , so beware of coco water coupons - - company may be trying to ditch stock . vitacoco rates about b + - - sometimes has a pulpy taste , like they scraped too close to the coconut shell when they extracted the juice . the one time i tried one , i didn't like , but a friends swears by it so i should probably try again . so i guess for now , i'll order vitacoco by the case . ps . i grew up in a tropical country and drank a lot of coco water right out the shell .

100 % natural meaty mammoth boner i have a pet saber tooth tiger that loves tasty snacks like bones , meat chunks , cow gristle , etc . i was looking for something that would take time for him to chew . the mammoth bone is perfect , since the woolly mammoth is a natural prey of a saber tooth tiger . i wouldn't say it's " meaty " since a bone by definition has no meat . i guess the brown part of it is some type of ligament or chunks of skin that didn't get pulled off in the factory . it's costly to get a bone really clean unless you use hydraulic acid , but then , it wouldn't be " 100 % natural " and it'd probably be very dangerous for animals or termites to eat . i've tried the bone a few times , it has a zesty flavor to it , sort of like it was barbecued on an open pit flame and doused with vinegar and pork grinds . i don't think if your dog is a vegetarian , that he would like this because it comes from some animal part i'm guessing . which part , i don't yet know . also , there's no instructions , so if you have small weiner dogs , you might want to grind this up before giving it to them since it can crush their aorta .

i've seen my dog eat everything but these my 3 year old lab loves all treats , but not these . when he loves a treat , he will eat it right away . with these , he buries them in the backyard , lets them rot for a month or two , then hides them in my couch and i find them quite some time later ( ew ) . i really have seen him eat everything ( whether he should or shouldn't ) , but he would not eat these if his life depended on it .

too sweet . . . don't need maple or honey . . . people are switching from peanut butter to almond butter mainly for health reasons . . . doing so means giving up mr . peanut , and this is sometimes tough to do . . . so , in order to make the switch easier , gimmicks are employed to help with this . . . adding honey , sugar , and maple syrup are a few of the ways this is done ( and yes , they do this with peanut butter too ) . i purchased this product and i think it is quite good . . . problem is that it is too sweet . i use the trader joe's almond butter with flax seeds and the taste is great . . . cheaper too . . . . a little more of an oily consistency though . i will now order the justin's almond butter without any gimmicky sweeteners . truth be told . . . good almond butter tastes sweet provided the almonds are roasted thoroughly . if you have a sweet - tooth , get this . . if you want to stay in line with health and not intake a little more sugar than you need , go with the one without the maple or honey . . . you shouldn't miss the unnecessary sugars . . . * * update . . . i got in the standard justin's almond butter and yuck ! now i know why everyone wants to mask the stuff with maple . it's like they forgot to roast the almonds . . . i don't get it . i'm going back to trader joe's almond butter with flax seeds . . . yeah , it's a little looser , but the taste is vastly better . i was hoping justin's could do better . . . they simply can't . . . and for this price , they should ! * * update 2 . . . okay , i'm back with the honey flavor and we enjoy . . . it just took some time to grow on us . i upped the star rating to 5 where it should be . . . it's good stuff ! !

don't use on hardwood floors our corgi really loved this food toy / game . the only problem , we have hardwood floors and the toy was going to destroy our floors . so we're pretty bummed , but the dog won't be using this after just one day . hardwood floors are too expensive to ruin for this toy . if you have wall to wall carpet or another type of flooring that a hard object won't damage it's great !

this variation of switch carbonated juice doesn't work for me . . . as part of the line of switch products , switch kiwi berry offers a ( slightly ) healthier alternative to carbonated soda . the product is 100 % juice , though the majority of the contents are neither kiwi fruit or " berry " : ingredients : 100 % juice ( filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates , apple , grape , kiwi , acerola , raspberry and strawberry juice concentrates ) , natural flavors , ascorbic acid ( vitamin c ) . unfortunately , the mix of kiwi and berry flavors in this concoction just does not work for me . the added kiwi flavor , in particular , imparts a odd sour aftertaste that i just could not get used to . my children each tried a sip , and for them as well the opinion was mixed . i was pleasantly surprised by the switch black cherry ( even though the cherry flavor was a bit weak ) , but i can't be very enthusiastic about this flavor .

best with feline pine litter box i have had a cat and a kitten for about 6 months now . i had tried a myriad of kitty litters prior to settling on feline pine . since one was a kitten and both came from a shelter , i don't think the cats were particularly picky about their litter . i switched them from clay to pine pellets without using any transition and they were unphased . after using feline pine for a few weeks , i decided to go ahead and buy two of the litter boxes made for the litter . having the ability to sift out the sawdust ( which is created when cat urine breaks down the pine pellets ) into the bottom pan has made litter box cleanup super easy ! this is what i do : 1 . scoop solids once per day and shake the box side to side in the evening to move any sawdust that the cats didn't scratch down into the bottom pan . 2 . empty the bottom pan about one time per week by dumping into a 5 - gallon bucket with lid . 3 . place a few of the slightly broken down pellets ( those that have been in the litter box for a week ) into the bottom pan . this keeps the sawdust from sticking to the bottom pan and makes dumping easier . 4 . add some fresh pellets to top tray if it looks too shallow . i do this when dumping bottom tray . 5 . completely empty the top tray about one time per month . place some old pellets in bottom tray as stated above . you can apparently use the sawdust as compost . i prefer to get rid of it by dumping the 5 - gallon bucket into a trashbag when full . then again , i also have dogs and i worry they would get into the compost . another note - a 20 - 25lb . bag lasted me about a month ( with a little left over ) and that took care of two litter boxes . my final suggestion . . . and this has been mentioned before . . . if you have a local farm store such as a tractor supply company , look for equine pine which is horse bedding . it is the same thing , but costs far less . up until recently , i was buying feline pine at $ 9 - 11 for a 20 - 25lb . bag . i found equine pine for about $ 6 . 50 for a 40lb . bag . much cheaper !

almost as bland as plain oatmeal i love the other kashi hot cereal , so i bought the vanilla with great confidence - - only to be completely disappointed ! it has little to no texture , it is very bland , and it gums up very quickly even with more than the reccommended amount of water . i originally bought kashi because prepackaged oatmeal is overly sweet - - this is not sweet at all . i also found it to be too creamy . if you're looking for an excellent hot cereal , try the kashi cinnamon and honey .

i have 6 favorites , this is one of them this review is going to get posted in 6 places , as i'm indicating my preferences for 6 different coffees . if you like one , maybe you will like the other . regarding coffee , i like strong and smooth . i don't like french roast as i find it too harsh , but i do like italian roast . kona is great and i like hazelnut , vanilla and chocolate flavors . i drink my coffee with probably too much ( at least 2 - 3 creamer containers worth to a 12 oz cup coffee ) of evaporated milk in it or plain non - dairy creamer . no sugar . that being said . . . my favorite coffees are : green mountain hazelnut dark roast extra boldemeril's big easy bold coffeenewman's own extra boldtully's coffee kona blend extra boldfolger's gourmet vanilla biscottiand a special mention fortimothy's world coffee german chocolate cake - it has an almost coco - nutty taste to it . not the deep chocolate taste i was looking for , but the best i have found so far . please if you can suggest a dark chocolate flavor coffee to me ; do so . also since i have posted a review about a senseo coffee and now clearly have switched to keurig a bit about why . . . if you're interested . . which why i put it last . feel free to ignore it . we decided to get a keurig coffee maker after enjoying the senseo system for over 3 years . please note , since we got the senseo system essentially free , not much thought was put into it's purchase . however it did introduce us to single serving coffee systems . we switched to the keurig system from the senseo for several reasons . 1 . local availability of coffee . for some reason the senseo system was waning here at the rochester ny grocery stores and what good is a coffee maker without coffee ? yes , you can buy online , but sometimes when your planning isn't the best , you might run out . what coffee they did carry was limited and not our preferences . 2 . online purchases of senseo coffees were either for 4 bags of 16 - 18 of one variety or 4 bags of a mix of coffees . invariably there was a few you didn't like . i never saw small quantities of 5 or so . 3 . the senseo " duck " for filling with your own coffee never worked for us . i'm an engineer and my boyfriend is an inspector . we literally did controlled experiments to get this to work and never could . maybe we had a faulty unit , but based on reviews here , we were in good company . i knew many that had luck with the keurig system however and we did as well . 4 . once you open a bag of senseo pods , they are starting to go stale , by virtue of being open to air . the keurig system's coffees remain sealed and you can have many flavors " open " at once . yes for those of you that are " green " there is more plastic waste . however i'm being selfish here and am being more concerned with the green in my pocket and fresh coffee .

i'm a nut for dried mango i only like the sugar free mango . the sugar added ruins the taste . this and much ado about mango are the best . this one has a better price but my grandchildren went through the bag like they were woodchippers . the smaller bags slow down the consumption ; as a result , they end up being cheaper per month . this product had smaller pieces ; however , the small pieces were absolutely delicious . much ado about mango has changed their equipment and their product doesn't taste as good as it used to . this bare fruit actually tastes like the old much ado about mango which is delectible . trader joes is the cheapest but isn't consistent at all . sometimes it tastes like plastic smells .

great tomatoes just spoke to muir glen customer service ( 12 - 21 - 2011 ) and they advised that if the " exp date " on a can of their tomatoes is dated march 2013 or later , the inside can liner is probably going to be copper - colored , which means the liner is bpa free . if the exp date is earlier than march 2013 , and / or the liner is white / clear , that liner is not bpa free . but there could be cans out there " exp dated " earlier than march 2013 , which are also copper - colored / bpa free . if you're buying from a retail store that does not turn over products quickly , note that exp date . if it's somewhere in 2012 , you may have a white - lined / bpa leaching can . i think it must be understood that amazon may not receive these directly from the processing plant , thus amazon may not control which product they receive . however , i received 12 28 oz cans mg fire roasted crushed from an amazon midwest dist ctr 2 - 3 months ago , and all of my 12 cans had the good / copper liner . regarding damaged / dented cans ; i suspect that if you get any cans from amazon that are dented , they were not dented from amazon to you . i suspect the cans were dented from the distributor to amazon . also , mg customer service told me that muir glen will not label their cans bpa free until they are sure there are no white - lined cans out there - could be another year or so . when they are sure all the cans of mg products are bpa free , then they will label their products " bpa free " , as this will obviously be a very positive selling point . regarding rating these tomatoes , they are surely a 5 star if anything ever was . how could you beat organic in a safe container and great tasting ? muir glen is to be commended for their approach to serving their customers with intelligence , honesty , and in a manner which encourages and promotes good health .

not a 10 lb box i have purchased items from fantastic foods before and i love all of their products . easy to make for quick meals and they taste great . i was very excited to see that amazon . com has these items in bulk so i purchased a few . all products arrived in great condition except the vegetarian chili mix arrived in a bag and not a box like the other items and it is not 10 lbs . judging by the size of it compared to the other items , it weighs around 5 lbs . amazon . com customer service is sending a replacement , hopefully it will be the right size .

read the product description before buying these aren't meant to be a meal , they're meant to be a fun novelty , and for everyone complaining and moaning about the size , read the product description before buying , it clearly gives the size .

only 4 flavors i ordered this to try a varity of samples to see which flavors i would like , instead i get only 4 flavors there you'd be no more than two f a kind to get a good cross sampling of flavors .

our dog seemed to like these our dog seemed to really go for these treats , she would go through them in a couple of minutes , which is pretty quick for her . i will say that she doesn't have any digestive problems ( other than the occasional gross noise here and there , but i could say the same about myself ) . so i didn't notice any issues before or after , which is fine by me . 
=================
who sent this gift ? i sent this gift to friend of mine whom was recovering from surgery . the gift arrived , but the get well note , that was to accompany the gift , was left blank . for several days my friend did not know who sent the gift . what a bummer . 
=================
not exactly this was a gift for an employee . what she received was not the variety i expected from the the description or the picture but she was very happy with it . the basket ended up being all chocolate . 
=================
a good thing it was a gift bought this as a requested gift . kind of sick looking when i got it , but the receipant was thrilled with it .

bully sticks vs raw hide i dont think a lot of pet owners realize that the reason raw hides are cheaper is because your pets can choke on them . they can rip chunks of the stuff off while chewing and it will expand after they swallow and choke . there have also been many cases of raw hides being contaminated with salmonella especially those imported from china . i have a friend whose little maltese got salmonella from a little raw hide stick off those cute christmas gift bags . she got lucky and got better but it took a couple of months and was on lots of anti - bionics . most shelters & rescue groups will not accept raw hides as donations . so although bully sticks and tripe are pricier , they have better nutrition as well as safety for your pet . as a precaution , make sure they are not imported from china . 
=================
i think you should buy this sure the price here is way way above what you have to pay just about anywhere else , but hey the carbonator is great and saves garbage pileup . soda stream has a great product and i have used the exchange service , i just paid a lot less than here .

used it once , but never again bought this paste in my local grocery store because it was the only thing they had , plus i didn't know any better . was making curried butternut squash bisque for the first time . the bisque was good , but little did i know , it could have been much better . because this product was so expensive - - it took a whole jar to give my bisque a mild curry flavor - - i looked to amazon for an alternative . found mae ploy thai red curry paste - 14 ounce per jar and gave it a try . prepared the same butternut squash bisque and oh . my . goodness ! what a difference ! ! try the mae ploy . . . you will get a huge container for a fraction of the cost , and the taste will be better than you ever knew was possible . kept in the fridge , it keeps for a good long while . but , when you taste the wonderful flavor , you'll be looking for recipes calling for curry paste . try the yellow and the green curry too . totally different tastes .

holy gas batman ! i love kashi products . i think they taste great and the health stats are sublime . it is with great pain ( literal and figurative ) that i rate this a 2 - star product . i must be in the minority , but about 2 hours after eating any of the go - lean cereals i experience pain inducing intestinal gas ( farts ) . google it if you don't believe me . if this didn't turn my stomach into a pressurized cannon , i would easily rate it 5 - stars . it's healthy , tastes great , can be found on sale for the price of regular cereal , and amazon has it for subscribe and save . unfortunately , i am one of the seeming minority who will have to stop eating this after making the connection to it's terrible gas inducing powers .

excellent product , but . . . . . excellent product ! ! i've tried several different brands of various so - called " popcorn oils " over the years , including one marketed by the elderly gentleman who we all know and love for his popcorn , all of which seem to be made of soybean , canola , or something even worse , and which , quite frankly , taste as bad as they sound . none of them even come close when compared to coconut oil , either taste - wise or healthwise - yes , i said healthwise , check it out - and this " real theater " brand of flavored coconut oil is without question the best my wife and i have ever used . we own an old - fashioned movie theater style popcorn maker , so i can't vouch for popcorn made on the stove , but there's no reason why there should be any difference in flavor no matter how it is made . please remember that this is coconut oil , and unlike other oils , it will tend to solidify at ambient temperatures of maybe 70 degrees f or cooler . the product label doesn't explain this for some reason , but it's a natural occurrence for coconut oil . anyway , you can simply scoop out the amount of oil you need , but i suggest placing the container in some luke - warm water until the oil returns to a fully liquid state - maybe 5 minutes or less , and then pour out the amount needed . it doesn't need to be refrigerated after it's opened , and has a virtually unlimited shelf life . the " but " in the title line refers to problems we had with the vendor when it came to our shipment , but this is after all a product review , not a customer service critique . 
=================
order fulfillment / warehouse problems ? the product i ordered was fine ; the price , vis - a - vis supermarket , was excellent ! delivery time , great . but what i ordered was a 6 - units - for - the - price grocery thing . what i got was a single unit , not the 6 . when i called about this , the mistake was corrected immediately , so that was good . and i got to keep the single unit i received free . that was nice . still , you may have a picking - and - packing problem in the dog - treat division . any ideas on how to avoid this ? the order form doesn't supply any alert mechanism . so i guess the picker just has to read the order more carefully ?

can irritate pets' eyes ; advertising misleading i ordered it with the intention of using it on the garden of my daughter in law while visiting my son this summer . she has complained about chipmunks eating her flowers and this seemed to be a good way to deal with the problem . initially she was very enthused about testing this product , especially after i showed her on the amazon description that it could be safely used around pets : " safe for use around children and petsmade from all - natural ingredients , critter ridder is organic materials review institute ( omri ) listed and usda approved for use in organic gardening . because it's epa - registered , parents can feel confident using critter ridder around their children and pets . " however when she read the fine print and discovered this " precautionary statement " she declined to give it a try : " hazards to humans and domestic animals . caution : causes moderate eye irritation . " if there is anything that my daughter in law enjoys more than her garden , it is her 2 cats . the possibility of causing discomfort to her " children " or somebody else's dog or cat was enough to deter her from using this product . the product may be very effective , but the advertising in misleading . i'm sure there are many other pet lovers with gardens that would like a product that deters pests but does not harm pets . they shouldn't be assured it was safe for pets then find otherwise in fine print after making the purchase .

makes your hair fall out . . . i had seen the commercials on tv and thought since i have naturally fine un - treated blonde hair i would give it a try . within one month my hair was falling out . not just a little , a lot . hairbrush full , shower , or just falling out . thought it might be thryoid , hormones or something else . went to the doctor and had all blood work done . everything fine ! i read comments for all brands of clear on amazon , found a lot of people were having the same issues . . . . quit using the shampoo and went back to pantene . within 2 weeks , my hair was slowing down in falling out . within 3 weeks , much to none was falling out . called the manufacturer and complained . they said this was unusual . . . i advised them to check customers comments on amazon . they offered to send me coupons for free porducts . . . if you want to give this shampoo a try , good luck . if your hair starts to fall out , remember this comment . it makes your hair fall out .

same as retail this is the same price per pound i can get at whole foods or giant . the suggested retail in no way matches retail pricing . i can get better pricing on other online sites . i can find this item cheaper at the discount retail stores in my area . why have online stores matched retail brick and block stores ? $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $

great . . . but packaging is a greasy mess product tastes good enough . . . but when it arrived it was a greasy mess - - with the cardboard box even showing the grease leak . i think each bar is leaking . amazon was nice enough to refund the cost however . i think the can might be a better bet . i've noticed , all my local grocery stores only stock the can . perhaps for the reason i experienced . 
=================
bar count went from 10 to 8 ! ! ! these granola bars are the best out there , however , quaker and amazon pulled a fast one on me . i subscribe and save to these because honestly i eat 12 boxes in about a week and a half . however , quaker changed the number of bars in a pack from 10 to now only 8 ! same price yet 2 fewer bars per pack . now with this order i'm basically getting 2 less boxes each time for the same price . amazon should have at least warned me that my 10 - count 12 pack order was now an 8 - count 12 pack order and that i would be paying the same price . i guess its back to buying the variety pack at costco with 60 bars , the downside being the dreadful oatmeal raisin bars i am inevitably forced to eat . actually the oatmeal raisin are pretty good , just not at all compared to the chocolate chip peanut butter . 
=================
90 % liquid , 10 % vegetables this soup is bland . watered down . the can only contains around 10 % vegetables & there's only bits of vegetables . no real chunks . so before you click the purchase button , i encourage you to visit your local grocery store to buy ( 1 ) can to ensure you want to be stuck with a pack of ( 8 ) cans . trust me . you'll thank me later . 
=================
very tasty product , but please note one odd issue this is a very tasty product . this is my first time trying this , and i am glad i ordered it to see how it tastes . as a product i'd order it again . one odd thing though that will cause me to lower this rating from 5 stars to 4 is that the listing here says a pound , but on the label 16 ounces is crossed out and 14 ounces is written next to it . i didn't weigh the container to confirm this , but if it is 14 ounces , then then they need to update their listing to show such . since i consider shipping to not be part of a product review i won't lower my star rating for this , and consider this to be just a mention of this then but the shipping was slow . i ordered it on june 20th . a usps tracking / delivery confirmation number was generated on the 21st to be fair , but it took until july 5th for me to get this . even taking into account that there was a major holiday july 4th , that just seems too slow . everything was packaged well enough ( although without anything like a " blue ice " pack to keep it cold for summer shipping . . . ) but just took a long time to get here . i do suspect the order wasn't truly shipped until the week before the july 4th weekend , despite a tracking number being generated on june 21st .

shame on amazon the product is great , and is truly helpful . howeveraccording to kellogs webpage - they promised that the pricing of the gluten free rice krispies would be the same as the regular rice krispies - well , the regular rice krisipies for the same size packaging is selling for 11 . 16 and the gluten free is 15 . 90 - shame on amazon and boycott the purchase here until they address / fix the pricing .

fleischmann's sour dough bread machine mix i tried this mix in my bread machine . i have a very good bread machine , but it did not come out well at all . oh , well , it does say " for easy oven baking or bread machines . " i baked the next batch in the oven . it was better .

should be - 5 stars based on reviews , i bought this " stuff " , even my dogs won't eat it . some one got me again , probably won't be the last time that i buy " stuff " . you know what i mean . . . right ? but . . . the next time i see 5 reviews , 5 stars and no other reviews , i'll run like the wind . should be labeled " stuff "

good price ; prefer flavored . purchased on - line since difficult to find in stores nearby . good price ; not thrilled about flavor . have since found pods in store i shop ; a little pricier but chose of flavors . a little on the strong side .

extremely hot i'm sitting here sipping my milk after trying this sauce for the first time and i will tell you that this sauce is very , very hot . it's definitely hotter than any other sauce that i've bought at a store and the heat lingers for a while after being consumed . the shipping was very decent also ( ordered on thursday , received on monday from seller acss ) . the taste , however , has left me with something to be desired . it just tastes like any other hot pepper . i was hoping it would have some other spices in there to really get the flavor going , but it doesn't . bummer .

get better quality tea for less $ $ ! lipton does taste good but it's not a good quality tea ! if you open the tea bag you'll see their not tea leaves but tea dust ( cheep ) . even the loos lipton tea is described as being " broken down so you need a fine filter to strain it . " when you steep good tea it should unfurl and look like spinach ! they say this tea comes to $ 0 . 57 an oz ? ! ? ! ? ! lets do the math . $ 27 . 54 devided by 8oz = $ 3 . 44 . i buy my tea from set to a tea [ . . . ] ) . it's really good tea with flavoring and dried fruit pices . it comes to $ 3 an oz for a tin or $ 2 . 57 for a refill . weather you buy it loose or in bags you get the same quality tea ! i went to a tea party last year ( like a tupperware party but more fun ) where the chick told us all about the different kinds of tea and gave us samples .

great product but why has the price doubled ? i love this offering from coffee people . it is rich and bold , just the way i like my coffee . but i was shocked to find the price has almost doubled in just a few weeks . what's going on ? at $ 1 . 00 per cup it's no longer worth the price . i'll go for their jet fuel coffee at $ 0 . 60 .

2nd order went awry well i bought this item before and enjoyed it immensely . pink salmon is very good for you . this time i ordered again , received albacore tuna instead of pink salmon . amazon does not do returns on groceries such as these , even if not opened that i can see . i sent personally an email to raincoast trading company based in canada , also left a phone message as well . delayed response , but finally got emails and they were courteous but they redirected me to try help center to get credit and get the correct item . gone through hoops in the help center of amazon to no avail . until i found the toll free amazon phone number , amazon llc confirmed they can not accept the return , but will send the correct item promptly . we shall see , awaiting a replacement item . a minor complaint they are smaller can sizes than the normal pink salmon i am used to ordering . anyone want some tuna ? o well . p . s . updated review sept 30th 2009 , i finally got the ordered item , partly because the amazon rep corrected it when i called in and sent it fast ! btw , it cost me a toll call to canada to the company without a prompt reply . that just added insult to injury . well i was able to order from a different merchant through amazon . thank you amazon for coming through : )

product great - pricing is wrong the castor & pollux veggie 3 - pack is a great item . my cats love it . however , the pricing is way off . c & p sell this item for $ 7 . 49 , so at this price i expected three 3 - packs , but only got one . amazon agreed to credit my account . if the pricing still says $ 19 . 42 , you are better off going directly to c & p .

new senseo pods i just tried the new vienna ( hazelnut flavored ) senseo pods . i'm not a big flavored coffee drinker , but i just wanted to try something different . it's a really nice cup of coffee . the flavor isn't too strong - which i like . i also like the combination of the different flavors ( hazelnut , chocolate , etc . ) . i had tried the folgers flavors but they are way too artifical tasting - can't hardly taste the coffee . if you want to try somthing differnet in your senseo machines , you should check these out .

disappointed when i was a kid , a very long time ago , we ate a lot of spam . my mother worked . spam was great . cold it made a good sandwich , fried , even better . i recently bought a can after not tasting it for many years . i was a little surprised how watery , greasy and just plain nasty it was . i tried frying a piece and it almost disappeared . i gave it 2 stars only because i figured hormel had to meet a price point and this was the best they could do . i find it funny and sad how many people think this crap actually tastes good . shows how our standards has fallen over the years .

only 1 minute of chewing this chew in the " wolf - size " lasted my 22lb dog about a minute . he easily broke the bone into large chunks and swallowed them . i would not recommend these as a long lasting treat though they are apparently tasty . bully sticks last much longer for him and might be a good alternative to these because they are also easier to digest than rawhide treats . 
=================
pleasantly suprised i had some reservations about ordering the crazy cups flavored sampler due to the mixed reviews . but obviously most people don't read the actual description , it clearly states " due to availability some flavors may be substituted without prior notice . " the other thing i noticed is that this sampler is sold by several different vendors and fulfilled by amazon . i think that has also contributed to the mixed reviews . i purchased the 35 pack from amazon warehouse deals . i didn't have my heart set on getting certain flavors , i just wanted to try some new flavors without buying and entire box of 1 flavor . my k cups arrived packed loosely in a box and none were damaged . i got an excellent assortment of flavors . brands included wolfgang puck , green mountain coffee , donut shop , timothy's , gloria jeans , and grove square . of the 35 i got 20 different flavors ! as far as expiration dates , i only checked about 5 of them and they all had dates of june or july 2012 . so i think the biggest factor is who are the packs actually sold by . i noticed most people don't say who theirs was sold by . 
=================
not the best for my cat i got this for my cat , thinking it was 'human grade' , grain free , hence good for my cat . i realized the marketing is aimed at human sensibilities because it certainly looks and smells good enough for 'people' food . it may be great for some cats , but mine gained 2 lb since she's been eating this and i was feeding her much less than suggested . she also developed urinary problems . my vet who is one of the few vets who have studied nutrition , tried calling weruva to find out more specifics about their food including calories , because many of her feline patients were eating weruva and gaining considerable weight . the staff at weruva would not talk to her or answer her questions and i couldn't guess why that would be unless their research has no real scientific backing to indicate this is a nutritious food . i tried calling them about week after that to see if they would tell me anything - - i got the same dismissive response . pet food is not regulated and these smaller manufacturers can get one vet to review their ingredients and pay them off to say - 'hey this is a great , human - grade , grain free food' . while i've read the positive reviews about this food and some obviously find their cats love it , if your cat is gaining weight or developing urinary problems while on weruva , think twice about buying it . 
=================
not bad not bad for a quick microwave meal . as to be expected from a korma , it really has no spice whatsoever . comes alive when adding your own peppers . it's not up to restaurant quality , but you could do a lot worse for 3 - 4 minutes of preparation . 
=================
double the price welli have been using this for quite a while and even though the place where i shop the prices are exorbitant , this vendor's prices are more than double what i pay for it on the retail shelf ( i get it for . 46 cents a pack ) i certainly don't understand how people can afford to pay such dishonest pricing .

have you seen how much ranch 99 is trying to charge ! ! i bought this 6 pack because for the price that my local ranch 99 was trying to charge , i could buy 3 through amazon . product is identical and managed to save tons of money on sauce i use on everything . 
=================
the best seasoning there is ! don't believe what you hear , msg is completely natural and safe , and has never been proven to cause headaches , etc . . it's sodium and an amino acid your body produces , and a third less sodium than salt . so if you're " allergic " to msg , you're allergic to yourself . it's found naturally in tomatoes , mushrooms , etc . , etc . .

brm vs pamelas i feel bad for alot of other gf bread / baking flour makers because if more people discover the goodness of pamela bread mix they would go out of business . my sister and i are celiac and believe me we tried it all . we tried baking our own to purchasing about every different mix we could find and it came down to pamelas or brm because they are more readily available at local grocery stores . let me tell you pamela blows them all away . i've had family member and co - workers ( who by this time were pretty scared of taste testing my gf baked goods ) completly surprised some even said they preferred over wheat varieties . the sweet bread recipe taste almost like a moist potato bread . sorry brm

lil guy liked them . . . his tummy did not . my boston thought these were awesome , and stole a second one from the package after i'd already given him one a few hours before . after getting halfway through the first one , he threw up the entire thing . that evening , he had pretty yucky diarrhea . for that reason , i haven't given him any more since then . in general , he's got a touchier stomach than a lot of other dogs , so maybe it's just him . however , if you're going to bill this as offering digestive support , it better not cause my lil man to throw up and have diarrhea . wouldn't buy again .

the gold standard for pumpkin pie ! the best , most delicious and totally consistant pumpkin pies are made from libby's 100 % pure pumpkin . a single 15 oz can makes one deep dish 9 " pie ( 4 cup volume ) or two shallow 9 " pies ( 2 cup volume ) . if you are making two deep dish pies buy the 29 oz can which is far more economical . this is what comes in the can : 100 % pure pumpkin . . . . which can also be called pumpkin puree or solid pack pumpkin . nothing else , so salt , no preservatives . the pumpkin is cooked during the canning process so you could eat it straight from the can , should you so desire . the pumpkin pie recipe is on the back of the can . i've tried other , fancier , more complicated recipies over the years but have always come back to the tried and true because , to me , this is what pumpkin pie is supposed to taste like . you get a fragrant and flavorful pie with an excellent texture . the recipe calls for sugar , evaporated milk , eggs , cinnamon , ground cloves , ground ginger , and salt . i add 1 / 4 tsp . ground nutmeg and a dash of white pepper . also , i like to slightly froth the eggs because it gives the filling a smoother and more delicate texture . the recipe calls for baking the pie 15 minutes at 425 and then 40 - 50 minutes at 350 . i cover the crust with foil for the first 25 minutes to keep it from getting too brown . also , i find that 40 minutes at 350 is more than enough . don't overbake ! if a knife comes out clean from the center of the pie , its done . on average , this 15 oz can should be about two dollars and fifty cents at a supermarket . one last thing , if you remove the label from the can , you will find other recipies and helpful tips printed on the other side . its a total win - win !

currently cleaning up puke ! these were on discount so i figured why not try them being that my dog's mouth smells like his other end if you know what i mean . after two days of giving him 1 chew a day , he started vomitting everywhere . it has to be these chews as we haven't given him anything else new lately and he rarely ever vomits . i think i will be sticking with greenies from now on .

good , but too sweet i like the high protein / fiber and low calories . but this was way too sweet . i had to double the amount of recommended water to be able to drink this . i have also tried the iced tea and pink lemonade . i like the pink lemonade best and this one the least . overall , the product is not bad . it dissolves completely and does not have aftertaste . give it a try . but before buying a bunch of one single flavor , try them all first .

one of the boxes i received had only 17 bars in it , not 24 i placed an order for multiple boxes of this item . when i opened the first box , i immediately noticed the bars were all jumbled up , with obvious voids in the box . i took the bars out and counted them , and there were only 17 , not 24 as was indicated on the box and on the amazon website . i weighed the box and it weighed considerably less than the other boxes . i opened one more box , and it did have all 24 . i guess the machine packing it malfunctioned , but it should have been weighed and the discrepancy caught before being shipped from the company , imho .

goji berries , huh ? this is my first time trying goji berries , so unfortunately i can't speak for the quality of this product compared to others . i can say that the product arrived fast , well - packaged , and that all the berries are bright orange with no sign of mold / spots / nastiness so far . that's probably a good sign . ; ) i'm not really wow - ed by these , though . i mean , they're little dried orange berries . not a lot of flavor , especially when pre - soaked . they're aight , i guess . i might experiment with a couple other brands to gain perspective , but maybe some things aren't meant to be dried out and shipped halfway around the world . no complaints with the condition or quality of the product itself , though .

only for the desperate i'd keep these on hand for emergency food prep only , the exact situation we faced ( snowed in , couldn't get to store ) . luckily , we still had power during the snowstorm so we made the product as instructed . one tip here : remember that microwave ovens all cook at different temps and speeds , adjust cooking time accordingly . this should be gooey and not hard as a rock . we had two packages and had to test one before finding the right cooking time . the taste : totally disappointing . while we all wanted a sweet treat , this barely met our needs , providing only calories and some energy , making me qualify it as suitable for " emergencies only " . as far as providing a taste of sweetness , yes , this was fine . however , it fell far short of the " warm delight " promised by the cover photo and title . there was a decided hint of preservatives and some unpleasant flavors , creating an unsatisfactory culinary experience . no one expects a microwave mix to be high cuisine but this was barely palatable . we don't have gourmet standards by any means but this was not liked by anyone in the family , although the adults managed to eat our portions . the kids ? forget it . however , although i couldn't find them here , we did try some mixes during the snowstorm that exceeded our expectations . one was better homes and gardens chocolate chip mix . if you can find it , get it . it not only came in a lovely container but included the bonus of a year's subscription to bh & gardens for only $ 5 . 00 , a bargain rate ( optional , not required to subscribe to buy mix ) . the mix in container cost $ 5 . 99 so we felt this was a better use of our money , leaving us with a reusable and microwavable container and tasty cookies for the $ 5 . 99 . if we wanted , we had a monthly magazine for another $ 5 . 00 . you do the math and conduct a taste test and i think you'll agree that " warm delights " aren't so delightful . just a thought .

gets really old . . . pretty quickly i tend to love spicy noodles of all kinds . i go more for the stove top , than hot water in a vat variety . the first time i tried it , i thought it was okay and i really wanted to love these noodles because it's lower in calories than my go to shin ramyun , but i just couldn't love it . i dreaded eating the noodles again because i felt as though it tasted like plastic . i am definitely not ordering this again . i still have a number left from the pack that i bought . i would recommend trying one before buying a whole box .

lol energy i drank one of these at 8 : 40 am and didnt get to sleep until 4 am ! ! maybe there were other factors involved but , if i drink a cup of coffee at around 5 or 6 pm i dont get to sleep until late as well . anyway my local dollar store sells these for 1 . 50 so check around . still a bit expensive but ill drink em . berry tastes decent . lemon lime is atrocious .

i hated it , but mom loved it . i thought this cereal was terrible . it has a very odd aftertaste , and to be honest , this is what i would imagine balled up pieces of paper soaked in milk would taste like . very " cardboard - like . " it also has that really strange , fake vanilla - like taste that a lot of the ultra - healthy and " organic " cereals have . for me , this is just further proof that these " healthy " cereals taste awful . i'll stick to the cheerios and special k , thanks ! that being said , i'm still giving this two stars because my mom loved it . don't ask me why , because lord knows i have no idea , but she thought it was great . when i asked her what exactly she liked about it , she state that she enjoyed the taste and the crunchiness . she thought the vanilla flavoring was good , and was surprised that i didn't like it as she felt it was very " true to taste . " she also liked that it had so many healthy things in it , i . e . flax . she thought that for a " healthy " cereal , it was very tasty . i guess all things considered it just depends on your personal taste . i mean , it's food . what one person loves another person dislikes . like i said , i thought it tasted like rolled up pieces of paper soaked in milk into which someone poured an artificial vanilla flavoring . she , on the other hand , found it tasty , crunchy , satisfying , and overall delicious . to each his own , i suppose . i personally won't be rebuying this one .

ok stock . . . . really disappointing on fixens . i picked up a pouch of this soup at a local market just recently . i have always loved a good minestrone soup and make it home made a lot . however like many others at times i like to keep it quick and easy , and a ready in no time bag of stock and fixens often fits the bill nicely . unfortunately this soup was quick and easy all right , but that is pretty much where most of the goodness of it ended . the recipe calls for 6 cups of water plus a 15oz can of tomato sauce . i opted for only 5 cups of water since i prefer a thicker , heartier soup . but as i mixed it all together it was obvious as it simmered that this was going to be a really loose watery soup , even with using less water than directed . oh , the pouch has a nice list of ingredients on it , including pasta , bell pepper , onion , celery , etc , but both the size and quantity of them all leaves much to be desired . the stock itself was not bad . it was not overly salty , was mildly spicy and tasted passable enough . but with every spoonful that's pretty much what you got every time . a lot of stock with a few pitiful pieces of fixens floating around in it . . . like all soup mixes , the pouch recommends some stir in suggestions . like sausage , hamburger , beans , and cabbage for example . but in my opinion if you want to enjoy a hearty soup for dinner on some cold night at all with this , plan on a stir in suggestion being not an option , but a must . and even then i suggest you use less than the 6 cups of water suggested . an even more sensible option is to forget this entirely and opt for a much better choice for a pouch style soup mix in the bear creek brand minestrone . available here on amazon , and in lots of local markets . its decently hearty all by itself , and is superior with some meat or other suggestion tossed in . and you even get more stock and fixens for about the same price as this cuginos brand . all in all i cannot recommend this mix . either try the bear creek or other mix , or go home made . . . : )

be careful of the tomatoes our 15mo old daughter has really liked most of the other happy baby foods ( she loves the gobble - gobble & mango - spinach - pear ) . however , this one makes her throw up every time ! she is not allergic to anything in the ingredients - i can only guess that the high tomato content is just too acidic for her tummy .

taste ok . the name is misleading . these pasta shells of of good , not great quality . as long as price remains reasonable , they are worth the money . main problem is the label and amazon ( who relied on the copy from the manufacturer ) , says " large shells " . these can only be called " small " . so if you need large , for whatever reason , do not buy these . get " primo pasta " brand large shells . they are large and superb ( but more expensive ) .

teeccino herbal drink the taste of teeccino caffeine - free herbal coffee mediaterranean almond amaretto is not the kind of taste i was looking for . i love the taste of coffee with no flavors added , but someone recommended this to me , so i tried it . my goal was to find something i could replace coffee with for a warm drink in the morning . but this is not it . i guess if you like the taste of almond you will like it . but i thought it was going to be a mild flavor . oh well back to real coffee until i can find something different .

very funny ok good people this is very funny and all , but some actually think this is a real product . shouldn't we be preventing this company to profit from ignorance ? this is a very old joke that became a hoax , you know it , i know it , but some don't . and it is not like the company is giving it away for free . . . amazon do you allow this ?

good value and fresh , wonderful smelling spice ! this cinnamon by frontier is a very good value for the money , especially if you don't mind buying in bulk . the cinnamon has a fresh and wonderful taste and smell . much better than any supermarket stuff . i keep the cinnamon fresh by putting it into freezer ziplock bags and freezing it . it's easy to take out of the freezer and use right from the bag , no thawing needed . as stated by a few other reviewers , this cinnamon is from cassia and according to wikipedia the " cinnamon " we get here isn't " true cinnamon " and it contains coumarin which is bad for your liver and kidneys at least . it's ok in small amounts and most people would never use a lot in their cooking that would do harm . according to the web site " spice page " you can eat up to one gram without getting the coumarin poisoning . please research this for yourself ! so this cinnamon is not for people that take it for diabetes / sugar metabolism and other health benefits . use this type only for use as a spice in your recipes or to sprinkle on food for added flavor . frontier does sell the more expensive cinnamon that is good and beneficial to you . it's called ceylon cinnamon , and it's the real deal . so if money is not an issue , or you are very concerned about your health and possible coumarin poisoning , please do not buy this type and go for the ceylon cinnamon .

mixed feelings they shipped 6 business days ( 8 real days ) after my order . and the arrival date exceeded amazon's max . estimate by 3 business days . it seems from their feedback page that they have been late many times but ppl are happy about the quality of tea . i can understand that , but i guess the online stores i've been using are just too good . also it doesn't say anywhere on the product whether the flavor is natural or artificial .

gf arrowroot bread recipe this flour makes the 'best' gluten - free bread in the world . here is my recipe which is a variation on betty hagman's recipe : arrowroot ( or corn flour ) bread ' * 1 cup arrowroot flour * 1 / 3 cup parmesan cheese * 2 tablespoons brown sugar * 1 cup cornstarch * 2 / 3 cup potato starch * 1 / 3 cup tapioca flour * 2 1 / 2 teaspoons xanthan gum * 1 1 / 2 teaspoon salt * 1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin * 1 / 2 cup dry milk or nondairy substitute * 1 large egg * 1 teaspoon cider vinegar ( non - gluten ) * 1 / 4 cup vegetable oil ( i use spanish olive oil ) * 3 tablespoons honey * 1 1 / 2 cups water ( scant , at temperature suggested by your breadmaker manual ) * 2 1 / 4 teaspoons ( 1 packet ) dry yeast'' * in a medium bowl , combine flours , starches , potato buds , parmesan cheese , brown sugar , xanthan gum , salt , gelatin and dry milk . * in another bowl , beat the egg slightly and add the vinegar , oil , water , honey . * * place in your bread machine in order suggested in the manual . add the yeast to the dry ingredients as directed in your manual . * * set on white bread with medium crust . well worth the cost . far better for those of us that suffer from bowel disease . i am a sufferer of ulcerative colitis and crohn's disease . the bean flours , sorghum , millet and flax seed meal all send me into horrible flares or give me terrible discomfort . this is the only one i can tolerate . betty hagman saved us all .

need more info on kili's package old kili's instant ginger lemon beverage mix was fragrant when added to 8 oz . of boiling water , and appeared to be darker than in smaller cup in the photo . the ingredients were not listed on the side of the box which always concerns me when trying a new product . i'm not a fan of sugar . also , the directions list only the metric amount of water to add , not a plus if you don't know metric conversions ( and i don't ) and nothing about the depth of flavor aspect . i am usually very fond of ginger and lemon drinks but as i said with no ingredient list , i was uncomfortable drinking it . it was tasty enough , but not all that remarkable to me . i have discovered since drinking it that dried honey was the sweetener , something that really should be promoted on the box somewhere . i like to be in control of how sweet something is going to be . a lack of information on the packaging would keep me from buying this product in the future . on the plus side : for an instant beverage , it wasn't bad . if you were traveling , taking it to work or camping it would be great to have along because of the minimal amount of effort it takes to prepare .

contains " natural fruit flavors " , which means ? updated i was going to buy , then checked the ingredients at their website . natural fruit flavors is one of the ingredients , unfortunately . google " natural flavors msg " , and wonder if the flavoring they add is high in free glutamic acid . maybe , maybe not , who knows ? i won't buy smooze unless they remove this . i'll give a neutral 3 star rating and change if i hear back from the company . here's the email i received : hi , sorry for the delay to response because we are waiting answer from the maker . they contain the natural fruit itself and traces of vanilla , carrot and cinnamon . thanksjcsmoozeusaso i'll add a star , and order some !

tasty , but not healthy for kids with 29g of sugar horizon vanilla milk is like drinking a coke from a cow . just because something is " organic " doesn't make it healthy . 1 cup of whole milk has 12 grams sugar , while 1 cup of horizon vanilla 2 % milk has more than twice that - 29 grams of sugar ! plus horizon vanilla milk has 180 calories vs 150 for whole and 120 for 2 % milk . two cartons of this stuff is an entire meals worth of calories .

good coffee but i agree with d . hall ! the coffee is as good as everyone says but my first order of twelve jars showed up will all but four jars broken . amazon's distributer just put the glass jars in a tight cardboard box and shipped it . i then spent several frustrating minutes on amazon attempting to find a phone number to call to fix this problem . i think amazon tries to hide their number . don't believe me ? try finding it . my wife actually found it by accident after she asked me why i was swearing ? once i got ahold of amazon they could not have been more helpful . my rep just said ; i am sorry sir . we will overnight a replacement , no charge . so the next day the coffee shows up and all but seven jars are broken . no padding , just glass and box . how a company that ships packages for a living does this i do not know . anyways , i ordered twelve , got eleven then called it a day . so , good coffee , bad packaging and if you still can't find the number here it is : 1 206 266 2992 good luck .

buyer beware make sure when you shop for kopi luwak that you are getting the actual 100 % kopi . there are a number of blends out there that sport a whopping 2 % or 3 % of kopi beans mixed with something else . the true kopi has a remarkable smokey , silky character with a wonderful caramel finish that coats your mouth long after swallowing . i just shared some with my veteran coffee roaster ( his first taste ) and he remarked that it was the best coffee he had tasted since the old kona before the quality dropped in the early 90's . real kopi should be treated like gold and with respect by : using a burr grinder on the fine side of medium grind ; making a single cup at a time ; and using water at about 190f ( boil filtered water and let it sit for 1 minute ) . wet the grounds ( about 2 standard coffee measuring scoops ) with a little water at first , then pour just enough for one 8 oz . cup . btw i discovered you can reuse the grounds from this process one more time with only a little reduction in quality if you make the second cup right away . you can stretch your kopi dollars this way since you are spending about 7 $ a cup .

well - balanced coffee when roasting coffee , there is always a decision on how far to go . too little does not develop the nuanced coffee flavor but gives a solid drink , too much yields acrid , bitter blechh so common in certain national chains . melitta has addressed this dilemma by including both horns , a well - roasted noir , and substantial body from the so - called blanc ( medium roast ) . what you get is a very drinkable blend without the harsh overtones which have been modulated by the lighter roast . of course , being a pre - ground blend , it is important to store properly after opening to maintain this flavor balance .

low carb crackers i ordered these elsewhere because i didn't want to be stuck with several packages in case i didn't like them . if you're doing atkins or another low carb plan and have been missing crunchy crackers , this may be just what you're looking for . the taste is not bad but as other reviewers have mentioned , these crispbreads are extremely dry . you have got to put something on them - butter , cream cheese , jam , anything and you should have a beverage with them too . if you consider them to be a vehicle for great toppings , i don't think you'll be disappointed . low calorie , 2 net carbs per slice , plenty of fiber and crunch . what's not to like ?

yomogi & red bean mochi sampler the items arrived perfectly on time , however the yomogi & red bean mochi sampler product was clearly past expiration date . the mochi were cracked and dry , they didn't have the correct gummy texture that mochi have and the taste , although not bad , was poor . the japanese green tea mochi , however , are perfectly fine , soft and plump . i believe a company that sells out these delicate items should check that they are in perfect conditions before selling the products , also because due to amazon policy grocery items cannot be returned , even if defective as is apparent in this case .

tastes bad i can't speak of the benefits yet , but i'll comment on the taste . it doesn't really taste like ginger , it tastes like the spiciness left behind after you've eaten a sliver of it . it doesn't taste good , it's drinkable , but not pleasant . it's really spicy . all i taste is spice . it's not " strong " per say though . it also has stevia in it , and i can taste it , and i hate stevia . leaves a bad aftertaste . i will only buy this again if i notice any benefits , but i'm only on my second cup .

'suggested retail' is way off . . . each pack is labeled to be $ 1 . 39 each individual package is clearly labeled to cost : $ 1 . 39 . last i checked , $ 1 . 39 * 24 = $ 33 . 36 , not the $ 52 . 80 that amazon has listed today . while the safety in naming an item a 'variety pack' lies in the potential of there being different combinations of 7 assorted flavors ; my package included 6 flavored coffees , and 1 non - flavored variety . 1 . mackinac island fudge2 . french vanilla3 . traverse city cherry4 . creme brulee5 . hazelnut6 . toasted maple nut7 . jamaican me crazythe nice thing about the paramount coffees is that each flavor is not over - powering . to give you an idea of what i mean : drinking them black you can taste the flavor ; with skim milk you get a hint of the flavor ; with cream and sugar , if you close your eyes and pretend real hard , you can sometimes guess which flavor it might be .

first one star ever sorry i have a 10 month old weimaraner that loved the regular busy bone chewbone threat so i thought i would give the chewnola dog treats a try thinking it would be even better . he took it right away when i gave it to him and chewed on it for about 2 minutes then left it alone . he will eat if it is the only choice he left it laying in the living room and went and got one of his rawhide bones . i gave it to him yesterday and you can barley tell he has eaten any . there is only a little granola missing . i am starting to think he scratched the granola off . i don't think he likes the texture of the granola because it is a little sharp . this morning he was soaking it in his water bowl then eating it and it looks like he likes it a little better now that it is slimy , softer , and less sharp . i will not be getting this type again i now have a sticky mess to clean up .

explosive beagle farts it's hard for me to rate this stuff , since i've never tasted it myself , but my beagle absolutely loves it . he had no trouble transitioning to this brand from the crappy stuff his previous owner was feeding him . to be fair , i kept him on that food until the bag they gave me ran out too , so i know what he was like before the switch too . the only problem i've had with it is , as the title of this review suggests , the flatulence . ever since i switched him over to this food , he's been healthy and happy , but he now has the stinkiest farts i've ever smelled and he unleashes at least one a day . sure , it's hilarious when he does it in my room mate's room , but not so much in my own or when we have company over .

nothing else tastes as good i drink fruit teas as well as the more robust teas , and the german rock sugar will sweeten them without drowning out the flavor of the tea . regular sugar does not , and neither does demerara sugar . when i bought the german rock sugar at teavana , i was told it could be used in cooking , but due to the expense i will only use it in my tea . but it is well worth the expense in my opinion , especially if you want to taste your tea , and not the sugar .

my dogs love these , but they are extremely overpriced on amazon . com the product itself is great , thus my 5 stars . my dogs love these and i think it's helping their dry skin , but . . . wow @ the price ! i had no idea the 6 - oz . size is the same package i buy at petsmart for $ 4 . 99 - half the cost i paid here - and for 3 bags at that ! : ( ( ( ( ( i had run out , so i didn't have a package to check the size . i thought i'd add these to my amazon order for convenience , and * assumed * the 6 - oz . bag must be considerably larger than the ones i get at petsmart , given that the price was twice - very odd for amazon , so i never suspected the packages are the same size ! people - definitely get these from petsmart , or check petsmart or petco online even - this is way overpriced ! if i could have rated the price itself , it would have gotten zero stars ~

the stevia product i had been waiting years for ! i've tried a number of stevia products , and all of them had a nasty aftertaste . not sweetleaf , though . so far i've only used it to sweeten my coffee , but the result is absolutely pure sweetness . i couldn't ask for a better taste . now , granted sugar sets a standard , but sugar has a taste that comes additive to sweetness ; sweetleaf has a bit of an additive taste to it , too , and it ain't sugar , but neither is it something horribly bitter like some of the other stevia products . i particularly love the fact that sweetleaf is the real deal . unlike , say , truvia , which is a proprietary blend and a misnomer , sweetleaf is pure stevia .

very disappointed - won't make the mistake again . . . i've been buying the art of appreciation gift baskets for years for my family members . the recipients were always grateful and seemed to have enjoyed the varieties . this year , i got curious and ordered myself a basket after sending several of the same out to my family and friends . upon receipt , i was shocked at the content and the presentation of the basket especially for the price paid . i could probably come up with a much better mix with less than $ 30 - in fact i will do so from now on . i feel embarrassed that this is the type of baskets i've been sending out year after year to my loved ones . don't be fooled that you'd impress anyone with the included caviar - it tastes like salty but unsweet flying fish eggs . as a person used to the caspian caviars and even some cheaper american paddlefish alternatives , i find it insulting and again very embarrassed to have sent the product as gifts . i should've known better . . . i called my sister ( yearly happy recipient ) and asked her if this is how it had been for years , and she giggled sheepishly and that's all i needed to know . received contents : 4 pieces ( 1 . 2 oz ) of belgian truffles3 . 5 oz dill salmon spread ( alaska smokehouse ) 3 . 75 oz pasteurized cheddar cheese ( northwood cheese co ) 0 . 95 oz mochaccino mix - enough for one 6oz cup2 oz smoked almonds ( los olivos ) 2 oz wine & cheese biscuits ( los olivos ) 1 . 8 oz chocolate dipped ( truffle ? ) cookies4 oz tuscan crackers ( focaccia crisps ) 2 oz water crackers ( three pepper blend ) 4 . 4 oz wafer rolls ( tiramisu flavor ) 5 oz pretzels ( typical salted dried ) 4 . 4 oz angelina's sweet butter cookies2 oz green olives , pimento stuffed ( mille lacs foods ) 2 oz black capelin caviar ( season brand ) missing items : 2 pakages cafe comfrorts white chocolate cocoa mixsesame crackersmerlot wine cheese - or is this for the pasteurized cheddar flavored dip ? stone ground mustardms . pinables caramel confections

pretty nasty tasting stuff coffee , is wifey and my favorite hobby we utilize most of the known ways of preparing it and we scour the net and shops for the perfect bean . i recognize that most of our likes come from what we grew up tasting and drinking , so our coffee tastes are compared to folgers or butternut , however we have made an effort to expand our coffee palettes over the years . that said i prepared the coffee using a vietnamese coffee filter system and it was not drinkable , i tried using the chemex system which usually yields a mild result and still no good . french press , nope . next step is a cold brew which often makes the worst and cheapest beans drinkable , if that doesnt work , i'll give the can to my brother in law , he will hate it but not admit it because he thinks he is a sophisticated drinker of exotic coffees i give him all my nasty beans . lol . i watched a program put on by illy on creating good beans ( actually my favorite espresso bean is lavazza super crema ) anyway they talked about a bean they called a 'stinker' thats a bean that if it finds its way into the blend will ruin the blend . i have found beans like that they have a cheezy smell to them . it could be possible that my can of trung nguyen had many 'stinkers' oh well , do keep in mind that when it comes to taste , whether its food , recipes , or coffee and its infinite varieties of preparation , what makes me gag , may be another persons absolute favorite . try it for yourself , one can wont break you , if you dont like it you could use it to sepia stain your black and white photographs or i'll give you the address of my brother in law .

avoid the cans from sri lanka ! like the other reviewers , i fell in love with native forest coconut milk ( from thailand ) - rich , creamy , and oh so delicious ! but then . . . i got a shipment with cans sourced from sri lanka : thin and runny , slightly brown , and smelling like old sneakers . i've requested a replacement order from amazon and my fingers are crossed that i receive a shipment from thailand ! if anyone knows the secret to getting only thai - sourced product , please leave me a comment ! thanks !

degree time released deodorant degree's silver ion deodorant was one of the few i could use , because i am allergic to the aluminum compounds in antiperspirants in most deodorants . degree discontinued the silver ion series and i was very disappointed , but learned that the time released degree replaced the silver ion with the silver in it . i love it !

small boxes these are the small boxes of juicy juice . i love the small boxes . kids can actually finish the box and i don't have to worry about spilled half juice boxes . the kids on my son's t - ball team seem to prefer the orange tangerine flavor . these go much quicker than grape and strawberry kiwi .

where's the tea ? this sampler is great for those who want to find the best taste out there . unfortunately , i was looking forward to the tea samples that should have come with this package . not a single tea pod to be found , this was disappointing . we are enjoying the coffee and would recommend trying it .

if you want hot , this is gonna burn you i can not really tell you too much about the flavor because this burned all the taste buds off my tounge . before i tried it , i thought it smelled good . i could smell the pinapple juice in it . it made me think of the tropics . now to put the taste in context . i eat dave's insanity sauce and have no problem with the heat , as a matter of fact i asked the salesperson for something hotter because i was getting used to eating very hot foods . i eat blair's sudden death sauce and think it has good heat . but da bomb was easily so much hotter than those two it burned my tounge like nothing else i have tried . i found myself by the kitchen sink washing my mouth with water . for those who eat tobasco , move on , this is like asking for car battery acid . but for those who are eating habanero's and think dave's is mild , then this might be what you are looking for .

dont buy this the product is good but amazon can't pack it . most likely you will get a broken crate that can't be fixed and some of the chocolates will have leaked .

before you buy a case . . . total bummer . my little pup doesn't like these 'lamb and sweet potato' tidbits at - all . and i have no idea why . i bought this recipe at the grocery store and everything on the package looked good . there's 9 % protein , a reasonable 4 % fat , with 11 % moisture and 4 % crude fiber . the approximately 1x1 inch tidbits ( about 1 / 4 inch thick ) are made with barley , lamb , sweet potatoes , with organic molasses ( yum ) and few other good things , and yet , i couldn't interest ms . charlene ( charlie ) in playing with one , much less eating one . she's a puppy - - russell / beagle mix - - so maybe she's picky or maybe she prefers something with more fat content , or with more smell - appeal . again i don't know , but i did want to write a review to warn you that you might want to buy a single bag versus a box full . two stars for excellent organic ingredients . no additional stars because my young pup wouldn't eat more than one tiny corner of one .

great for the price but not so good quality . . . . . i purchased these bags because i was storing a lot and thought these were a great value . they are . these bags re easy to use , take 6 oz of milk , and have a double closure . and you can lay the bag flat in your freezer to allow to freeze as a small narrow package . all the attributes i love about this product . but ! ! ! ! ! for the third or fourth time now , when i thaw the frozen milk , the bags leak milk all over my fridge . this leak comes from the bottom corners of the bags - not the top seal . i have now learned to put the bag into a glass container , so it doesn't leak all over the fridge , but lost milk is lost milk .

tannic and bitter overpower the sweet i am glad for the chestnut growers that the bees are there to pollinate their trees , but i cannot say i like the resulting honey . the tannin and bitterness of this honey , not its power , are what i dislike ( i like a manuka , which has quite a powerful , rich breadth of flavors ) . but there you have it - i dislike it , and cannot recommend it , yet mr layka from new york adores it .

too bitter , not even close to starbucks store brewed cup i finally gave in and bought the starbucks house ( and breakfast ) blend k - cups ( from keurig's site ) . neither a like getting the same cup at starbucks . i realize it can't be exactly the same , k - cup vs large brewer . but , for me , the house blend is undrinkable - it's too bitter ( and i've tried brewing 3 different sizes , from smallest to travel mug ) . it's just bitter regardless , with no underlying complexity of flavor . won't be buying this again , even if it was less expensive . for comparison , i like tully's extra bold breakfast blend and tully's extra bold kona blend , both of which i brew on the 2nd cup size ( ~ 7oz ) . i've liked some other k - cups in the past , but they haven't been available on keurig's site for a while ( actually , the tully's kona isn't available on keurig , either . but the amazon price for that is so high ! ) . ( fyi - the starbucks breakfast blend is ok , i guess . but it doesn't have any of the complexity you taste in a cup from starbucks . so , to me , it's definitely not worth spending more on starbucks branded k - cups since i don't feel like i am getting anything close to the store brewed cup . actually , i don't like it as much as the tully's above , so wouldn't buy the starbucks bb even if it was the same price . ) hope this helps someone , since obviously taste is very subjective ! c -

tolerable coffee albeit smells like hell this dry coffee ground stenches of turpentine and vodka , the bag itself smelling of dogfood before it's opened . the bag sent to me might just be aromatically individuated , but if so it's a stinky individual . once brewed , the coffee functions as coffee does and seems low acid for its effect on my stomach . the pleasant effect of the low acidity might be worth the initial stench ; no belly cramps nor aches occur after drinking it . the horse flies and god himself stay away from the grounds though , on the basis of its infernal reek . if you don't care how pernicious a stench the coffee grounds have before the coffee's made , this is a fine product indeed - - and it's low acid content , so it is easier on your belly .

check the source of the honey before buying before you buy this honey , you may want to read this article . apparently honey that originates in china can contain antibiotics , heavy metals , etc . this article makes me wonder where aunt sue honey comes from . - " the sioux honey association , who says it's america's largest supplier , declined repeated requests for comments on ultra - filtration , what sue bee does with its foreign honey and whether it's ultra - filtered when they buy it . the co - op markets retail under sue bee , clover maid , aunt sue , natural pure and many store brands . . .

mail order cheese the product was well packaged and survived transit in good order . in fact the product was extraordinarily packaged and evidence the shipper has a good grasp of the shipping of perishables . the product is now in refrigeration and expected to give hours of fine eating . it is strangely gratifying to have something to face such perils arrive without incident . a well done and pleasant sales transaction .

great food , but do not buy from premium pets etc ! ! this food is a lifesaver . my cat loves it . he howls for more just an hour after eating ! he isn't vomiting or drinking unhealthy amounts of water anymore . i tried another brand when the shipper failed to send my second delivery in a timely manner and my cat turned his pink nose up at it . this food is stinky , but my cat and i are happy to have it . if the secondary seller , premium pets etc comes up when you try to purchase this , run , don't walk away from the shopping cart . i ordered 3 additional cases from them when i had one week of food left . although he charged my credit card immediately , it took him 6 full days to ship the product and he couldn't provide tracking info to me . his office phone mail is often full so you can't call for an update . since he was so late in sending the food out ( with no communication of the problem , i had to chase him down ) , i requested an upgrade to overnight shipping . premium pets etc rep told me he couldn't upgrade because he'd already shipped it , then refused to provide the shipping confirmation despite my continued requests for the # . when the package arrived , i found that he was lying , he didn't ship it until late that night when he said he shipped in the morning . horrible customer service . amazon should be ashamed to be associated with such an unprofessional seller . it's really sad because this is a product which is needed for medical purposes . because of premium pets etc's poor service , my cat was sick all weekend when i couldn't get to the vet to buy other food because he was still promising he had shipped it when he hadn't . when the food still didn't arrive , 8 days after my order was placed , i had to take off work to go buy other food , losing income on what was supposed to be an easy online transaction . i can't say enough bad things about premium pets etc .

the name says it all kuding translates to " bitter nail " and honestly that really tells you a lot about the taste . i drink this tea really from the perspective that you don't drink this tea for the taste , but the health benefits . my knowledge on traditional medicine is really limited so i'll not go into it so that i'm not misleading anyone - but effectively this tea is supposed to help with too much body heat which manifests in a few different ways . drinking this tea tends to " cool " your body down and is supposed to help balance the fact that most people's diets do not include much that is bitter . i found personally that after drinking this tea i tend to sweat less , and it helps me feel better . the taste is something that will throw off most people , so i wouldn't advise this to most , it's incredibly bitter , but if you start with one nail and work your way up , you won't be overpowered . the other thing is drink this tea while it's hot , it makes it much more bearable .

you do not get what is shown i ordered this salada decaf white / green tea blend because i had tried it somewhere and loved the taste . i looked in many stores but could not find it . everyone had decaf green and decaf white but nobody had the blend of both . i was so happy when i found it shown and listed on amazon so i was thrilled to order the case of 6 boxes . it arrived a week later only to be 6 boxes of the decaf white tea and not the blend as advertised on this website . be careful ordering this most likely you will not get what you ordered .

warning - cans buckling ! i purchased and received a case of these 6 oz items mid - march - 2008 . i used two cans then and in reflection remember one of them spewing some paste when first pierced by the opener . tonight i've gone to open another can and this time it really projected out the paste when pierced with the opener . so i decide to check over the others and find 4 of them really bulging - each end pouched outwards a centimeter or so . and another 8 cans showing 1 to 3 mm bulges at each end ! this case has been in an a / c - ed home in a dark closet . the case of small cans appears to come from 3 different lot numbers ( opjcs 6 ashx24 1121 , opjcs 6 ashx24 1122 and opjcs 6 ashx24 1123 ) note the 1121 / 1122 / 1123 code differs . with just my visual inspection it appears all affected cans are 1122 but i will not be eating any of the remainders . i will be contacting the manufacturer asap to see if there has been a recall or known problem .

hcg friendly - not pasta though ! think asian dishes ! ! i had read all the reviews on this product and realized people either hate these or love these noodles . so , i bought them . i'm on the hcg diet and everyone was talking about them . do you eat them in p2 or not ? there is a huge difference in opinion on that subject , but , i wanted to add something with a little substance about 2 weeks into p2 , so , bought them . i was afraid to open because so many had said there was a fish smell . but , there was none . still , i rinsed them for about 3 minutes in a collander under running water anyway just in case there was a strange taste . which there wasn't . they do look like pasta , but . . . . they are not pasta ! i would never mix them with pasta saucedo think asian dishes - put them in a brothy soup or stir fry ( p3 for the stir fry ) less is more ! they will " blob " up on you . you need to pull some strands out and add to your broth . just dumping them in won't work - they stay in a blob . taste is not pasta ! they tend to take on the flavors you are cooking them in . personally , i didn't feel they had any flavor , mainly just added substance to my soup . will i use them on round 2 of phase 2 again ? absolutely . they are filling . everyone warns that if you are using in p2 , just be careful . see how you react to them on the scale the next morning . some people do fine , others gain a pound . again , i would not make a meal out of them , especially the first time . maybe add a couple forkfuls and see how you like them , and , how the scale likes them . i think the negative reviews were from people that were looking for a pasta alternative . i cannot emphasize enough that there is no comparison to pasta - do not expect these to replace or taste anything like pasta ! you will be extremely disappointed .

simply the best mangosteen product ! i rarely take the time to write reviews but this product deserves the time . this is simply the best mangosteen product available . i have been a long time advocate of the mangosteen fruit and it's health benefits . i have been a long time sufferer of chronic tendonitis and severe arthritis from numerous surgeries on my ankle . this product does not solve all of my pain but daily use creates an extremely significant improvement ! the mangosteen juice allows me to function normally and with a noticeably reduced level of pain . this product is superior for 2 reasons . first the product consists of mangosteen whole fruit . the rind ( or pericarp ) is where the majority of the xanthones ( the main benefit of the fruit ) are found in the fruit . many companies exclude the pericarp because it doesn't taste as sweet as the rest of the fruit . " the genesis product contains 100 % wild harvested whole fruit including the thick tough and bitter inner and outside rind ( pericarp ) . other ingredients : none " the second reason which may not be as noticeable at first glance but thailand is notorious for it dangerous and harmful use of pesticides . pesticides are poison . if you already have health problems chances are that they're from ingesting toxins . many mangosteen products use fruit sprayed with these poison and don't tell you anything about it . my girlfriend sells one of these products ( which is how i originally became interested in the mangosteen fruit ) and is upset b / c i switched to the genisis brand . i told her that as soon as her company removed all of the additional apple juice and filler crap , provided information on exactly how much mangosteen juice is actually in the product , and provide information about the pesticides sprayed on the fruit they use , i would never switch back to a substandard product that may actually increase health problems rather than help .

not worth the money i would consider myself a caffeinated products connoisseur , so of course i've had 5 hour energy before . but it's not something that i'd consume on a regular basis . it's just ridiculously expensive compared to equally effective products . right now i'm taking black friday to cyber monday deal - 50 % off sale : the good morning pill 60 pill bottle energy pill supplement to increase focus , replace drinks , shots , coffee , which costs like 33 cents per pill , and gives me just as good ( or better ) energy boost than a ~ $ 2 5 hour energy . i've also taken isatori energize all day energy pill , tablets , 84 - count bottle in the past and also plain caffeine pills , and either one of those options would also be a fine substitute for 5 - hour . bottom line - if i get one for free i'll drink it , but why take a $ 2 shot instead of a 33 cent pill ?

very earthy flavor i mean earthy , like dirt . this tea is very woody , and earthy . there is no pear aroma , flavor , i don't know why it is even on the label . i don't hate it , but will find trouble trying to finish the 48 cups i bought . i think anyone who buys this must have tasted rooibos tea before . i love the organic part of this drink . i did not find this tea weak , the flavor is just bland , except for the slight woody aroma , and an earthy taste . it is unique alright , but not like a tea to me . maybe it takes getting used to .

watered down sports drink this is the latest foray into the " all natural " nutritional drinks market . despite boasting " real fruit juice " on the packaging , the flavor is simply too watered down to notice . having drank plenty of coconut water , this drink has barely more than a hint of it . most likely , it clashes with the taste of the guava , which is also hardly noticeable . in fact , were it not for the label on the packaging , this reviewer would not have been able to tell what the flavor was meant to be . speaking of the which , the odd packaging is rather reminiscent of the fruit juice packs aimed at kids , sans the accompanying straw . also , this 8 . 5 ounce drink will not go far to quench anyone's thirst or give any noticeable energy boost . given the price for a pack of 12 , it is not asking for much to give the consumer more juice for the buck . the nutritional content stacks up nicely to other comparable drinks , however it does have more sugar than some others currently on the market . overall , o . n . e . has produced a product that is nothing special in the world of sports drinks . while it does offer fairly solid nutritional content , the bland taste and small size does not make this a good value .

little whiskbroom pellets even the dog wouldn't eat this . seriously . i wanted something healthy , free of corn syrup , msg , soy this - and - that , and all those multisyllabic mystery ingredients that only the fda could love . this cereal gains a star for that . the ingredients are " wheat bran , whole grain corn flour , whole grain wheat flour , corn bran , cinnamon " . ( the nutrition panel does mention that the cereal is produced in a facility that also handles soy , dairy , and tree nuts . ) but there's got to be something natural that can be added to pick up the flavor a bit . as it is , it tastes like pressed sawdust . any cinnamon included is so subtle as to not be noticeable . nature gives us fiber in flavorful packages - vegetables and fruits . if fiber is the main goal , there are tastier ways to get it . the texture is pretty much pressed sawdust too . there's got to be a way to at least make it texturally interesting . the drab color is fine , that means the product has no artificial food dyes . i don't care so much about visual appeal but it is a little disconcerting opening a box and seeing contents that are formed like snail pellets . with a name like " simply fiber " the appeal is going to be for old folks seeking the grail of an expeditious digestive system . the absence of typical ingredients may also appeal to those who find themselves allergic to many processed foods . my interest was more in just the general " healthy " appeal . to give the manufacturer their due , it's probable that some of nature's flavoring agents might not last long on the shelf . next thing you know there's the temptation to dump in a bunch of preservatives , and that's not necessarily a good trade - off . you know how breakfast cereals typically liven up the front of the box by populating the cereal bowl with colorful fruits or berries ? in this case i think it's not just decorative , it's a good idea . reasonably expect the cereal to be a little dull , and compensate by slicing in some strawberries , blueberries or bananas . on the bright side , this is only 100 calories to a 3 / 4 cup serving , according to the side panel . that serving packs 14g of fiber . at first bite i was tempted to toss the box but i'll probably keep it on hand and toss a baggie of this stuff in with my lunch for that hand - to - mouth grazing a person does for a mid - morning snack . that's certainly less fattening than what passes for granola . in sum , the product isn't calorie - heavy and it will appeal to aging boomers with digestive issues . it may also be a product of choice for those with certain allergies .

serving suggestion if you have 96 people to serve , this would be an excellent purchase . before serving , however , it would be important to inform each guest that they would only receive one pop tart , and that seconds would not be possible . unless , of course , one person decided against eating their pop tart . in this case , one person could have seconds , and so on . i would advise against this , however , as it would be rude to the other guests to provide seconds to one and deny the others .

nonni's toffee almond & lemon biscottis great product ; unfortunately shipping took a toll on the biscotti's ( majority arrived in crumbs & broken pieces ) . have since ordered an additional 8 boxes . the lemon ones were shipped in a second amazon box which seemed to provide some additional protective , as only a few were broken in some of the boxes . would recommend seller in the future ship all 12 pack boxes in a second box and add extra cushioning protection . it would allow folks to dunk their biscotti's rather than have to eat direct from the wrapper and get crumbs everywhere .

on the verge of being good , but something's missing i ordered this for my birthday . i got birthday money from family , and i ordered a couple of goodies , perfume , and this cocoa . i love hot chocolate , and i'm always looking for new ones to try . based on the first review i decided to go ahead and order . i will probably not reorder . mixed by itself into hot water it seems to lack thickness . it also has too much of an artificial raspberry taste . i like hershey's bliss raspberry chocolate much better . i've been adding one spoonful of the cobblestone kitchen to my regular cocoa to give it a raspberry boost . but , by itself , it does not stand up to the test . i plan on finishing the three remaining cans over time by using it as a stir in additive to other cocoa .

5 star veggie meal that you can drink ! what it is ? on campbell's website which includes v8 products [ which they also produce ] i found the following info about " campbell's low sodium tomato juice " ; " campbell's tomato juice is packed with goodness . each 8 oz . serving of campbell's tomato juice contains : full serving of vegetablesonly 50 caloriesvitamin avitamin c20 mg of the antioxidant lycopene " most importantly , this " low - sodium " variety has only 140 mg . sodium and 920 mg . potassium compared to 680 mg . sodium and 430 mg . potassium in the standard tomato juice product ! why should you want it ? if you are looking for taste , nutrition and low carbs / calories , this beverage is for you . add to that , low sodium in this particular variation , and you have a drink we should all be drinking . i was always a bit reluctant to indulge in this yummy tomato - fest because of the huge amount of added sodium , but now the low - sodium product has become much more available and costs only 30 % more than the original high - sodium version . typically , this low - sodium , mixed 100 % tomato juice is the type of drink that sells for $ 2 - 4 at a juice bar per 8 - ounce serving or about $ 8 - $ 10 per quart from a health food store in bottles . by the way : campbell's tomato juice is available in several varieties : regularlow sodiumhealthy requestorganiccampbell's website ( . . . ) has nutrition info on all their products and each of the 4 tomato juices individually . however , the only difference on the label of each variety of tomato juice was in the amount of sodium it contained . obviously , their are other differences , but label standardization eradicates their ability to illustrate it to us . it may take time to get use to tomato juice without salt , but one can taste the tomato in the juice for a change in this product .

it's not postum thank you for the comparison . the only similarity i found between postum & pero are the ingredients . the conclusion i came to is processing & amounts of individual ingredients must hold the keys to the differences in texture & taste . i am not a fan of the powdery pero .

too much variation in size of chews my dogs love these chews . . . must have one every night . however , i am continually disappointed in the quality control with this product . i have ordered numerous bags of these chews and the variability in size between bags is amazing . sometimes you will get a bag that has thick chews that are suitable for my big guys , other times the chews are paper thin and twisted . they do help keep teeth clean . don't leave dogs alone with them because they can be choking hazard . c . e . t . hextra premium oral hygiene chews with chlorhexidine , extra - large dogs , 30 chews

only suggests the taste of bacon . . . this is a product with a lot of promise - low sodium , no fat , shakes on anything . . . but it ultimately fallls short . it just does not have flavor that evokes real bacon . it is a halfway decent general purpose seasoning ( think of another take on traditional seasoned salt ) but it's a far , far cry from real bacon flavor . i would rank this at about 20 % accurate bacon flavor , the venerable artifical bac - o - bits we've all had over the years are just about as authentic tasting , maybe even slightly more . if you can manage to use real bacon bits , there is no comparison . still , i applaud them for trying , and i'll give any revised formula a try if and when they come out with it .

wasting vinegar on a cucumber is a shame ! i first bought pickled asparagus at an amish market and it was love at first bite . hence , when i saw these on the discount rack at the local safeway i cleaned it out . these are even better than the ones from the amish market . they are fantastic , and some of the jars have a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom . i'm going to order the six pack and i'm a household of one . they wont go to waste !

artificial acid - like taste mio mango peach comes in a handy dental - floss looking bottle , and has 24 servings in a bottle . basically you squirt some in plain water , and this enhances the water with a semi - artificial peach / mango taste . it also seems to contain food - color , since it tints the water a light peach color . i was curious to try mango peach mio , but i confess it really isn't something i care to repeat . the drink does enhance the water with a semi - fake artificial peach taste , but i confess i prefer my water straight and without the extra fake - flavoring and acid . while the taste was appealing , i don't need the extra chemicals or food dye in my diet , and as the main ingredients are : water and malic acid and contains zero fruit juice , you aren't really getting anything healthy here . i also found the ingredients in this drink mix irritating to my bladder , so those with painful bladder syndrome should be aware this drink contains acid . if you like artificial drinks of the crystal light variety , this might appeal to you . for me , while the idea was innovative , i would like it to be more healthy to consume and without the food dye and acidity . 
=================
the same as any other dark roast k - cup i drink a lot of k - cups due to the fact that my work has the machines and provides a great assortment of flavors . i would compare the kona k - cups to just about any other k - cup that's medium or dark roast . it's a decent flavor , but a huge disappointment because i was overly optimistic that it would taste closer to real kona that is fresh brewed a more traditional way . if you aren't expecting too much , this is a decent cup of coffee . if you want anything close to authentic kona taste , you need fresh beans and not freeze - dried plastic cups . if your only experience with kona is this stuff , you're missing out on a great cup of coffee at a decent price .

candy was fine , but . . . my husband and i ordered these for a family member for christmas . because they used to live in germany , we thought it would be a fun little gift to send them . although the candy itself was fine , the box that it come in was ripped and smashed . i guess i was just disappointed in the way it was packaged and mailed . it was put into a large envalope with no extra padding or anything . i mean , the point of the gift was the candy itself which was fine but it would have been nice if the original box had not been ruined . i had to throw away the box and find something else to put it in .

not what i expected my cats do not like pate style cat food . thus , they enjoy fancy feast in all varieties except " classic " . they really enjoy little pieces , be they grilled or shredded , in gravy . this was promoted as : delicious melding of filet mignon and seafood flavorsdelicious and enchanting shapes made with real seafoodenchanting shapes made with the delicious taste of real chicken and turkeyhowever , there were no enchanting shapes , just the classic can shaped pate . so it was disappointing . no where does it say this is classic . also , it comes in three seafood varieties . i don't see where the filet mignon , chicken and turkey flavors come in .

mr . picky cat eats them my cat happily scarfed down some of these . these cat dental treats appear to be different than others . dentashield coats the the teeth to block tarter formation . the directions say to feed the cat 4 - 5 of these twice a day . i'm guessing this little pouch to be about 2 weeks worth at that rate . corn flour is the first ingredient , not really the best stuff for your cat but corn is often a major ingredient in catfood anyway . as a treat , its probably okay , but these would be better labeled corn & chicken treats than salmon treats . having said that , the cat doesn't really appear to care ( he can't read ) . appears to be a nutritional supplement as well as a dental treat . wish there was some way to know what the rda of this stuff is for cats . the ingredients : corn flour , chicken meal , wheat flour , corn gluten meal , poultry fat , dehulled soybean meal , salmon meal , sodium hexametaphosphate , poultry digest [ what is that ? ? ] , dried brewers yeast , calcium carbonate , potassium chloride , salt , choline , chloride , lecithen , vitamin e supplement , niacin supplement , vitamin a supplement , calcium pantothenate , vitamin b12 supplement , riboflavin supplement , biotin , thiamin mononitrate , folic acid , pyridoxine hydrochloride , vitamin d3 supplement , menodione sodium bisulfite complex , ferrus sulfate , zinc oxide , manganese oxide , copper sulfate , cobalt carbonate , ethylenediamine dihydriodide , sodium selenite , mineral oil , dl - methionine , taurine , color added ( titanium dioxide , yellow # 6 , blue # 1 ) , bha ( a preservative ) , mixed tocopherols ( a preservative ) . guaranteed analysis : crude protein min : 25 % crude fat min : 8 % crude fiber max : 4 % moisture max : 10 % vitamin a 2 , 273 iu / lbvitamin e 14 iu / lbzinc 75 mg / kgselenium . 1 mg / kgtaurine . . 1 % calorie count 1 . 1 per treat

great product gone bad i used to be a big fan of thai kitchen's coconut milk and green curry paste . now the coconut milk is thinner in consistency and flavorless and the curry paste has lost all its fire . bummer , as it's hard to find quality products ( of any kind ) these days . interesting note ? - - thai kitchen was recently acquired by another , larger company . looks like the " recipes " have changed . as will mine .

5 . 5 month update - do not buy this product ! ! ! ! ! ! no matter how great an idea this item sounds like , do not buy it ! ! ! ! after all the buttpain this product has already caused me ( see below ) , a mere 6 days after receiving the replacement for the first defective driveshaft , turns out this " new " driveshaft has the same problem ! ! ! ! it seized up , and will not allow the blade to turn . at least the first driveshaft had the decency to work for 3 months . unbelievable that this product is still being sold on amazon , i am positive i am not the only one this is happening to . short of getting my money back , there's pretty much nothing baby brezza can do to make this right . send me another driveshaft ? ? ? yeah right ! ! ! ! > > original review > > had no issues with the baby brezza until now ( month 3 ) . the mystery black stuff i read about in other reviews has started making regular appearances and the blade is starting to get stuck when blending for no apparent reason . i really love what this product has allowed me to do ( i make food in it to feed myself as well as my son ! ) , but bummed that i'm encountering this problem which , from casual browsing of the other amazon reviews , is not a rare manufacturing defect , but rather a design defect / quality control failure which causes a $ 100 piece of machinery to fail just a few months after purchase . calling baby brezza customer service today to see how they can rectify this situation ( thank god i saved the box ) . > > > update 25 april 2012 > > > ! ! ! ! ! important information for brezzas with lot number mwi - 001bru ! ! ! ! ! ! ! after a few days of phone tag , the baby brezza rep contacted me and let me know that the particular lot number ( look for that on the bottom of the base ) of my brezza was indeed having the issues i described , due to a faulty driveshaft . the rep said they would " exchange " my faulty drive shaft for a new one , but unfortunately , the " new driveshafts " are still being made . and wouldn't be available to ship for approximately 5 weeks . their " consolation prize " was a free accessory ( of course , i had already purchased most of the accessories back when i bought the brezza ! ) . pretty damn inconvenient when you have a really hungry 7 1 / 2 month old baby . so if you have this lot number , even if it's working now , i would definitely lean forward in the foxhole and get baby brezza to send you a replacement driveshaft . the fact that they didn't offer to send a whole new unit instead of making me wait 5 weeks , and that they don't even have these new driveshafts yet , means to me that it may not only be this lot , but any other lot manufactured from july 2011 on that has the defective driveshaft . so buyer beware on this product if you haven't already bought one . it's a fantastic concept , just bad , bad , bad quality control for the $ $ $ cha - ching $ $ $ $ it costs . > > update 15 may 2012 > > received a replacement driveshaft , blade and container ( with lid ) today , along with the " sorry for the inconvenience " gift of a food storage unit . it's been about 3 weeks since i spoke with the brezza rep . not bad , given the estimate she gave me was 5 weeks . originally i was told only the driveshaft would be sent to me , so i'm pleased that i now have a backup container and blade ! i am satisfied , and have changed my rating , because i really do love what this product does !

one of my cats loves them i have 2 cats , one male and one female . the male is crazy about these . i just discovered that he got the bag , ripped it open and ate them all . i had started with a small bag to be sure at least one of them liked them , so not too bad a loss . the female just sniffed and walked away , but she is not crazy about fish flavored treats anyway . i just reordered a big bag of the poultry flavored ones . i am sure the male will like them and i hope the female goes for these as her teeth are the worst of the 2 of them .

if you like candy that you don't really chew ! it tasted good but it was not as soft as i was expecting it to be . i don't really like hard candy that stays in your mouth a long time which is the only down side .

passed the taste test ! everyone should know this is a healthier dog food than walmart brands , like purina , iams , or god forbid moist & meaty . ingredients like ground flax seed , peas , whole carrots , whole sweet potatoes , apples , blueberries and probiotics and the lack of sweeteners , by - products , and low - quality corn show this to be true . i just did a taste test with this harmonic farms and my dogs old iams proactive health and decided to make the results known . i let him smell both thoroughly without letting him eat at first , and placed the two piles a bit apart . he immediately went for the harmonic farms , finished it and didn't even look at the iams before coming back to me wagging his tail hoping for more . dogadvisor . com made me aware of my past mistakes in dog food choices and i was hoping to god he would not shy away from the healthy organic stuff like i do . to my great welcome surprise , he didn't ! i guess he's a hippie at heart . i on the other hand , will take my nachos bell grande .

bbq popcorn this tastes like the seasonings on bbq potato chips , so i like this one . it might just be my batch , but it doesn't seem to flow out of the shaker as smoothly as the other flavors though . and like all of these seasonings not all of the seasoning will stick to the popcorn and will wind up at the bottom of the bag or bowl , i don't think there is a way to get all the seasoning to stick unless you drench every single kernel of popcorn in butter spray . this stuff is cheap enough i don't mind , and keeps me out of the high fat and high calorie snacks . 
=================
salted styrofoam - but low - cal ! gourmet basics indeed ! i think the basics are to keep it simple and let the natural flavor of the food shine through . i am blown away that they have actually managed to make a " natural food " taste faker than andy capp hot fries , 3 - ounce bags ( pack of 12 ) . rice cakes have a luxurious mouth - feel compared to these . i couldn't get past the fake flavor and horrible texture . i just can't imagine what type of odd palate people must have to think that these abominations are tasty . perhaps people who are on a restricted diet might find these a convenient snack food . or parents tricking their kids into eating healthy . i can almost promise the parents that these snacks will go uneaten . i would have been more likely to eat the unsweetened baker's chocolate in the pantry before i'd eat these . though this product might be suggested by amazon if you purchase popcorners or popchips , do not buy it . these are nothing like popcorners or popchips , these " smart fries " are nothing but awful .

better than canned pears wasn't sure what these pears would be like . i eat pears with cottage cheese a lot . tried many brands of pears . too many are hard , almost too unripe . these pears are medium firm . not too hard and not too soft . could be used in any pear recipe . the light syrup is almost not syrup at all . not overly sweet and not thick . very thin so it doesn't ruin the taste of the pears . this is the second case i have purchased . i usually eat one jar a week and they have been consistently high quality . if you like pears , you will love these i'm sure .

not bad , considering it's healthy this is not a product i would ever consider buying . i'm the only person left who leaves the house without a bottle of water clutched in my fist , as if i were sanders of the desert setting out to find the source of the nile . i will not , on principle , eat an eggwhite omelet , and usually consider any salads other than tunafish the stuff you push away from the real food . but i have a healthy friend , a hiker / jogger type who goes to the gym every morning and can do that dog kick thing that led to my killing an aerobics instructor . i was acquitted . the jury all had expired gym memberships . anyway , healthy friend came over one morning to make nasty comments about my drinking coffee and huddling on the sofa when i could be exercising and hiking and drinking water out of a bottle . after lecturing me until i pulled my bathrobe over my head , she left . . . but she left her bottle of vitamin squeeze energy drink drops behind . this , by the way , is the new water drinkers trend . adding flavos and " energy boosting vitamins . " it turns water into something like diet coke , only with vitamins and without the bubbles and not as good tasting . now me , i don't want my energy boosted because then i might start doing stuff , and i'm happy sitting right here , thank you . so i called healthy friend and said " you left those trendy vitamin drops behind , " and she told me to keep them . obviously this was ploy by the incidiously healthy to ensnare yet another unwilling victim into their web . but boy , did they misunderestimate me . i tried the drops . the taste is sweet , kinda like the kool - ade i didn't like much when i was a kid . maybe little tangier , but not much . i waited for the big energy boost . nada . this will not replace my morning cups of coffee . however , the taste is not bad , the drops are chockful of vitamics from one end of the alphabet to the other , and for people who do this sort of thing , i'm sure it makes them feel even more smug and complacent . anyway , i did not waste the rest of the bottle . i poured it into a big 1 . 5 liter bottle of club soda . with some lime wedges , this is going to be one killer mixer when i add the gin .

good whole - wheat italian pasta any adult will prefer a rigatoni , especially slant - cut penne rigate and a shell conchiglie rigate , over spaghetti , fettuccine and other shapes of pasta , especially if its made in italy . italians demand that the extrusion dies have the grooves in them ; compared to american dies which leave smooth surfaces . the ridges make sure that the sauce sticks and coats the bland , high carb macaroni , since it is the sauce that gives the dish flavor . while i've heard that the italians actually buy canadian and us wheat , process it into pasta and then ship it back to the states , only the gia russa brand claim to use italian wheat grown near napoli , in southern italy . after cooking , however , it is still fairly bland tasting . their packaging copy claims " flavor produced is a rich nutty quality - - reminiscent of whole grain bread . " not here by me . . . but the raw pasta has a nice medium brown color . that said and considering american adults increasingly sedentary workstyles and desires to eat healthy with whole grains , my prior experience with american whole - wheat pasta ( esp hodgson mill , ronzoni healthy harvest , creamettes 3 - color rotini spiral - shaped ) is that they don't have the technique and experience in making great pasta ( it cooks quicker , but falls apart more easily , not a wide - band al dente stage ) . consequently i only shop italian - made whole - wheat pasta ; having come across this gia russa and racconto brands while buying it in a wisconsin - based supermarket , not finding it at the minnesota - based megabox incumbents . i still fondly remember my couple years shopping the philadelphia metro italian markets , where aisles and aisles where dedicated to at least 3 competing italian brand's full pasta lines along with aisles of olive oil by the gallon tins . but it was impossible to find whole - wheat back then . for the last half decade , i've bought de cecco whole - wheat spaghetti , the only whole grain pasta stocked by a st paul , minn italian run liquor store with a smaller italian meat , deli , and pasta - oil - spices section . i bought it even if it was more than triple the price of regular white pasta . in developing ways to make more tasty pasta so you don't have to eat as much to feel satisfied , i have turned to making a chicken , beef or pork bone and onion , ginger and chili stock to boil the pasta in , adding a couple minutes extra cooking time due to the grease slowing down the hydration process to the al dente stage . toss in a few whole garlic too near the end before using a pair of tongs ( or chopsticks ) to fish the pasta out of the soup ( could use a double boiler if not adept in fishing ) . i may add some sliced eggplant or broccoli spears to round out a one - pot meal . add some fresh - grated parmesan or reggiano to top it off and your dish is up . another variation on this theme is to add soup to a bowl of pasta or noodles to make a ramen - like snack , tasty without the msg and at a fraction of the cost of the packaged artificial soup and pre - fried alimentary paste . for a variation in healthy noodles , there are the korean wheat styles made with added buckwheat , or acorn , or barley . one of the tricks with high - buckwheat noodles turning into a gooey tasteless mess is rapid firming - up in an ice - water bath in the sink . surprisingly it works . then serve at room temp or quickly dashed with hot soup . i'm still looking for a canadian rizopia wild rice spaghetti to be sold in minnesota's traditional tribal monopoly " injun " country !

beef & chicken canned wellness didn't measure up . we've been ordering wellness for one of our cats who was diagnosed as insulin - dependent diabetic a few months ago . after reading many reviews on the internet , we chose wellness chicken and wellness turkey canned products . this has gone well enough . we though we'd give him a change of taste , so ordered a case of the beef & chicken canned food . he projectile vomited it all over the kitchen . maybe it's the beef , but the remainder goes to the local pound where it will hopefully be appreciated .

why why why ? why is it so hard to find mars bars in grocery stores these days ? do they just not ship to southeast pennsylvania anymore ? am i shopping in all the wrong places ? they used to be really popular 20 years ago . you'd walk in and there they'd be right next to the snickers and 5th avenue bars , but now . . . i guess they're being pushed to the side for other candy bars . this is an outrage ! i'm not paying more than 5 bucks for a few candy bars either .

( and it was hard to find anyone to complain to on - line . ) no customer follow - up or apology . though this nice link appeared today , with a price 50 % higher and asking if i might be interested . i'm not . this is still my energy drink of choice , by the way . the one star is for price & service .

works , but hard to open . . . buy larger version instead of pod even with the tips shared on how to open it , it's still pretty difficult to open . i guess i have weak hands . my husband usually has to open it for me , and even he doesn't do it with ease . i would recommend getting the larger prepara herb savor instead of the pod . it's much easier to open and can hold more . i could hardly fit any cilantro in the pod ( considering that the grocery sells them in such large bunches and i only use half ) . 
=================
way too salty ! ! the seeds are fresh , the shells are hard and the seeds are jumbo sized . the taste is good , but the over - powering amount of salt ruins the experience . the 'ranch' flavor would be much tastier if the salt used were lessened . then again , without the overwhelming amount of salt , david might have to use a bit more of the flavor for which you are actually paying . by the way , i don't often find items too salty , but this borders on the ridiculous , imo . i wholeheartedly endorse the jumbo size seeds , as they are much more enjoyable than the puny 'regular' sized sunflower seeds by david . i will be buying another brand of sunflower seeds in the future , hoping that it will not have the amount of salt the david's have . update : i finished all but a little of the case of david buffalo ranch flavored seeds and bought a case of the jumbo brand ranch flavored sunflower seeds . i compared them back - to - back . the jumbo brand is far less salty and flavorful compared to david's . it will be interesting how i will find the jumbo brand to be after eating them for awhile . right now , they seem a bit 'under - flavored' . still , that is preferable to david's overuse of salt .

not satisfied for years i used a " making bacon " pan that was invented by a pre teen . it was great except you have to use paper towels to keep the grease from coating your microwave . all the fat dripped in the pan and clean up was easy . i purchased this plan thinking that the lid would keep the grease from flying and i would no longer need to use paper towels . first the little pig face popped off after two uses and we have not been able to reattach it . i cannot seem to get the cooking time right with this pan - either over cooks or under cooks . the ridges of the pan are not tall enough to keep the bacon out of the grease . this unit is going to the local thrift shop and i hope i can find a making bacon pan to replace it .

use lightly on the ends of white hair i have another hair balm and was able to compare the ingredients , they are very similar to another product made for white hair , specifically split ends . if you have split ends , this will seal in the ends and keep them from drying and splitting more . just be sure to use so very little . rub your hands together and smooth through the ends of your hair . i really like this but the instructions are poor , even for black hair .

what the heck ? what the heck is going on with lipton darjeeling ? it disappeared from every one of the indian shops in the s . f . bay area about 6 months ago . the tin you see above sold for about $ 11 . this tea was one of the best kept secrets i know . now the only tea approaching . . . and i mean it is not as good . . . it is peet's darjeeling , at $ 10 for 1 / 4 lb . tin . the only other alternative for darjeeling is to go to some of the persian groceries and find it there . they sell a brand that apparently has lower - quality darjeeling that appears to be imported from india into iran , then sent to u . s . you could probably find other ethnic stores that have the same kind of thing . does anyone have an explanation for what is going on ?

tis is my least favorite flavor by alessi i didn't really care for the texture of the raviolini which was a little tough and is nothing like ravollini . my favorites in order of my favorite to least favorites are : 1 . split pea ( i add parmesean cheese and bacon ) 2 . tuscan white bean3 . neopolitan bean soup4 . milanase rissotto ( not a soup , it's actually flavored rice but it taste great with grilled or fried chicken ) 5 . minestrone ( just okay ) 6 . raviolini chicken soup ( the only one that i didn't like ) i haven't tried everything that alessi makes but they do make some really good soups !

super coffee flavor , will be a regular in my candy jar kopiko coffee candy has a 7 ingredient list , with coffee occupying # 4 and # 5 ; coffee extract and coffee flavor . it is little wonder then that it is one of the top coffee flavor finishers . it is a medium brown rectangular hard candy , not overly sweet , with a strong coffee flavor . the strength of the coffee flavor seemed to diminish the longer it is in your mouth , but that may be a taste bud thing and not a decrease in actual coffee flavor . the same is true with the united coffee candy . 8 out of 10 fyi - united , kopiko and coffee rio were the top finishing coffee candies in my taste test . god bless . mike

not the cereal i remember . . . i'm surprised to read the other reviews for this product . . . i was soooo excited to find my favorite honey nut clusters on amazon after searching for so long in the grocery stores where i live . i could not contain my excitement the day i knew that they would be delivered ! i got home to find 3 beautiful boxes with that memorable little squirrel smiling at me . . . i had to have a bowl immediately ! ! as i poured the clusters into my bowl . . . i thought to myself " hmmmm . . . this doesn't look quite right " i procedeed with faith that it had just been so long since i had seen the cereal . as i took my first bite i knew it was too good to be true . . . " these are not the honey nut clusters i know and love ! ! " i continued to eat hoping that i was imagining it or that it would just take a few bites to set in . but alas . . . honey nut clusters truly do not exist anymore . this cereal is more like honey oat clusters i do not see nut clusters . i even checked the other 2 boxes to insure that the first one was not just a bad batch . so to all those cluster lovers out there . . . i am sorry . . . but the end is here : - ( rip original honey nut clusters ! ! ! you will be missed ! ! as for those of you in search of the next best thing . . . let me introduce you to honey graham oh ! s and you can get them at a grocery store near you !

tastes like juice but not a substitute as with other varieties of this product , it tastes as advertised , black cherry , but i'm wary of any health claims . while it may be made of juice it isn't juice and juice isn't as good for you as the solid fruit . in this small can , only 8 . 3 oz , there is 130 calories so be wary of that too . if you love soda pop i think this could be a healthier version but if you don't , don't start drinking this this . make sure that you like the actual taste of the fruit in question and not a soft drink version because this is the real deal in terms of taste .

buyer beware ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i know you may be confused because i gave it 5 stars but wrote buyer beware . let me explain5 stars is because the treats are great thick moist and chewey and my dog loves them and i give " addiction dog food " 5 stars for their producthoweveri give the store that you order this from 1 star if i could give it less i would ! ! it is a rip off and jipit says you get 12 oz bag . . . . ummm not ! you 100 % get " only a 4oz bag " this company also sends old stuff . not once not twice but 3xs this happened to me . i stay clear of them now !

i've had better i bought a bunch of the kitchens of india items during a promotional sale and the only one i'd recommend is the butter chicken sauce . if they were tasty i could overlook the salt content for the occasional enjoyment but i'm not loving the taste . i ofter buy similar products from trader joes and those , in my opinion , are much better and cost far less .

hard hearted candy manufactured all year , sold now . for some reason i love this chalky , vaguely fruity flavored confection . i've been waiting all year for valentines day so i can go out of control and eat these things for no apparent reason . i purchased six of this exact product in this exact size ( 7oz ) and label : five from one supermarket and one from another . the candy seems stale . the purple ones are rock hard and i'm afrade i'll break a tooth so i throw those away , and the green ones are almost as bad so i've given up on them . that leaves the yellow , pink , orange ( usually ) and blue ones as safe to eat . these aren't supposed to be hard candy , are they ? the necco web site says these hearts are produced all year for sale during the valentines holiday period . they are supposed to be soft candy . so it seems that you may get a bag from eleven months ago or a couple weeks ago . good luck ! i think i got the from spring 2011 . by the way , i got my 7 oz bags for only a fraction of the coin demanded here , so best to look at the grocery store in the seasonal items area first . also , i bought a bag of the brach's conversation hearts and did a comparison . the brach's product seemed fresh with no rock hard hearts , but the flaver is a bit more bland . it's difficult to tell if the different color brach's hearts are meant to be different flavors . they're more like just fresh sweet chalk .

melted quickly , evenly - but very sweet , bad packaging the chocolate melted amazingly quickly and evenly . so much easier than cocoa or baker's chocolate with fats , etc , in a double boiler ! just put them in a microwave safe bowl , zap em , and set out some parchment paper for easy clean - up of the dipped items . however , it is much sweeter than other dark chocolates . certainly it is sweeter than i would have preferred . in addition , the bottom of the container had broken just as i lifted it out of the box in which it had been mailed - it was extremely thin , thinner than the lid , and the sides are sharp and basically cut the bottom in a circular pattern . so the remainder is now in tupperware and luckily i caught it before too much fell out .

really 3 stars but i don't care for ramen noodles for a fast alternative to junk food this was hearty , easy to prepare and fast . i would have liked to see more vegtables in it . it enclosed a tiny vegi season packet and terriyaki sauce ( sweet ) . flavor was good but if you pour this sauce on ramen noodles , they would taste good . why 4 stars ? i like the way the noodles are packaged . i bought this a grocery store and would not buy again or buy this on amazon . i ended up throwing some chopped up noodles in mine .

tastes just ok but what's in it ? the new " dark chocolate " flavor of kellogg's special k granola bars tasted ok out of the box . the texture was a little grainy , but not in a whole - grain sort of way . it was like there was some sort of powdery / grainy filler in it , which i think may be the extra fiber they tout on the label . i took a look at the ingredients . typically for a kellogg's product , the ingredients list was very , very loooong . i looked at the first ingredient and stopped right there . " what's 'soluble corn fiber' ? " i wondered . i googled the term and found some interesting things . one blog posting caught my attention . i think i'm not allowed to post external links here , but you can just google " soluble corn fiber " and find a posting called " link between corn syrup & artificial sweeteners . " it said that " soluble corn fiber " is just another term for " corn syrup , " and that the manufacturer of splenda , who also markets soluble corn fiber , was suggesting that food packagers could use that term to avoid consumer sensitivities to the term " corn syrup , " or , especially , " high fructose corn syrup . " that's not to say that this is not a healthy ingredient . it's just to point out that you may wish to learn more about food - processing ingredients whose names seem new and different to you and then draw your own conclusions . there are other postings that go even more deeply into this issue relative to soluble corn fiber . so , the product is chewy and sweet , with a slight hint of dark chocolate flavoring . obviously , they're going for a " dark chocolate " variety because of all the news about how healthy small amounts of dark chocolate can be for you . maybe that's why i was a bit skeptical when i saw the first ingredient here was something new to me . the flavor is good - - i just didn't love that grainy texture . we also have the issue of the packaging size . the box contains 5 bars , and the bars are on the small size , at that . but the box looks about the size of one that might contain 6 full - sized granola bars . also , the individual bar wrappers are quite oversized . once you open the wrapper , you see that the bar looks small inside it . the stats : each box contains 5 bars that are 0 . 95 ounces ( 27 grams ) each . total net weight , 4 . 76 ounces ( 135 grams ) . you can compare with your own boxes of granola bars . back to ingredients . after the soluble corn fiber , you have rolled oats . that's good . then isolated soy protein . ( i'm tempted to google again . ) then sugar . then " cereal ( rice , whole grain wheat , sugar , wheat bran , soluble wheat fiber , salt , malt flavoring , vitamin b1 , vitamin b2 , riboflavin ) . " notice that all that parenthetical stuff combined comes in after sugar - - not really a lot of " cereal " in this . then fructose , semisweet chocolate , vegetable oil ( hydrogenated and / or partially hydrogenated palm kernel , palm , canola and / or coconut oil ) , corn syrup , chicory root fiber , rice , dextrose ( isn't that the same as or similar to fructose ? ) , and . . . that's about two - thirds of the way down the list . there's a lot more . if you don't care about ingredients , it's a reasonably tasty snack that fills you up a little bit . personally , i get filled up much more by eating a fresh , juicy apple or a handful of grapes . kellogg's owns kashi , a brand i like . i really think they can do better than this special k - branded concoction .

nothing exciting the main problem with the product is that it leaked a lot in transit . luckily it's packaged very well so the package didn't arrive dripping but it was a mess to clean . also i received the shampoo courtesy of amazon vine but if i had actually paid for the product and lost a big portion in transit i'd be very unhappy . overall i feel like the shampoo leaves my fine hair almost too soft so it's not holding it's style terribly well . it smells great and feels wonderful to put my hands in but isn't quite giving it any volume or lift . i would not spend the money on this version of the shampoo in the future .

smart . . . but not so smart ? the product has a build in chamber that you can fill up simply by squeezing the bottle . there are also markings on the side to let you know how much so you can pour out exactly what is needed . but the problem is the container is not see through , nor can you see it while putting it up against the light . i even tried using a marker to mark the outside . . . . still no luck . i'm basically stuck using a measuring utensil of my own . smart idea . . . . stupid execution . : (

turkish sweet turnip juice ( salgam ) this product arrived as a birthday gift . after chilling it as instructed , i attempted to drink some . the first thought that came to mind as it hit my palate was sea water . salty ! then lemony sourness followed . not a sugary taste that i was expecting . no this does not taste sweet at all and had the sourness approaching that of a lemon . it has a strange but interesting aroma that is not at all bad . in fact i felt drawn to smell several more times trying to put a name on the unexpected yet familiar complex aroma . it reminds me of a bologna sandwich on white bread with overpowering hints of celery . if you are not used to this kind of drink , i will say that it is probably much more of an acquired taste . from wikipedia : & # 350 ; algam is a popular beverage from southern turkey's cities of adana and mersin . although the turkish word & # 351 ; algam literally means " turnip , " & # 351 ; algam is actually made with the juice of red carrot pickles , salted , spiced , and flavoured with aromatic turnip ( elem ) fermented in barrels with the addition of ground bulgur . it is traditionally served cold in large glasses with long slices of pickled carrots , called tane ( or in some accents , dene . ) hot paprika relish is added just before drinking . hot or regular , it is a popular drink with adana kebab . & # 350 ; algam is often served with rak & # 305 ; ( alcoholic beverage ) - - not mixed , but rather in a separate glass . while & # 350 ; algam is commonly used to cure hangovers , consuming excess amounts may cause bloating .

not bad these brownies are not bad for sugar free . if you are expecting sweet brownies , it is not these brownies . they do not taste bad , but are not sweet either . next time i am going to try and vary the recipe and see what i come up with . i may even add some extra sweetner to bring them up to par . they are cheaper at other low carb sites .

taste so good ! ( pineapple mango review ) i love the mango pineapple stix ! it's a great balance between a sweet tea and juice ( tastes great with vodka too ) . i was suprised by how many were here too ! there is a ton of these little stix . the taste is refreshing , my new favorite summer drink . only complaints that do not give this a 5 star ( not the taste , but the packaging : 1 ) there are literally 12 packs of 10 stix , lots of cardboard and wasted packaging . you'd think they'd be a bit more efficient and have them all in once box . 2 ) the tear to open each stix sometimes rips all the way down the packaging , getting powder everywhere . the first time i opened these , powder got everywhere . crystal light packets open across the top horizontally . these have the slit vertically , it's not good . beware . even with the horrible packaging , i love these and will be buying more !

contains 0g fiber ! i bought this product for the fiber in prune juice to aid in my son's constipation . compared to regular prune juice which has about 1 . 5 g fiber in 4 oz this juice has 0 g fiber in the same volume . the ingredients just list apple and prune juice but don't list how much of each . clearly it's more apple than prune . if your kid likes to drink apple and prune juice then this product is fine but if you're looking for something to help with constipation you should look elsewhere . what a waste .

fine tea , but not whole leaf i had never heard of this tea until finding it here while scanning for something different . different from the pg tips i've been using . i prefer loose leaf but pgtips are pyramid bags . so i searched and found the dilmah web site . all the tea is from the same estates . not blended , they say . one disappointment is that this is broken tea rather than whole leaves . what do they do with the whole leaf ? it is 'loose' , but not 'loose leaf' . the quality of the taste is certainly not impaired . far better than pg tips . more expensive as well .

under rated this product rarely works unless you get the seed packs and immediately plant them . . . very expensive , and maybe 50 % of the time , you may or may not get anything to grow . i've had this for 3 years now and rarely had but a few things grow . . . much easier to go to the garden shop and buy the plants and put them in your garden . i've had tons of their kits sent to me , and only half of them seem to work . . . i'll call customer service , and yes they will send more . . . . but by then , the 3 that worked are growing big and you cannot start the new ones . sorry to say , this product is for " rich people " who have the time time play . i'm only wanting to plant foods to eat and survive .

long time loyal customer no longer ! i have only fed my 3 dogs canidae since 2002 . until 3 days ago we have had no problems at all , and i had highly recommended the food to everyone who would listen . that is no longer the case . recently , canidae decided to change the formula , and without any notice being placed on the bag . two weeks into the first , and last bag of canidae i will every buy , one of my dogs began chewing his feet . prior to 3 days ago , he had never had a " hot spot " or anything close to it . . . . and now i cannot get him to stop chewing his red , soaking wet paws . one expensive vet bill later , the vet said it is an " allergic reaction . " allergies ? ? ! ! i do not want my dogs to be miserable with allergies ! ! besides the constant chewing , not one of my dogs has had a firm stool since their first meal with the new formula . one of my dogs is prone to anal glad issues , and so it is critical that she have a firm stool . in addition to my issues , my breeder , who recommended the food to me , and who has been feeding her dogs canidae for much longer than i , has taken her dogs off the food . why ? her dogs became violently ill , vomiting non - stop , itching , acting lethargic . she has contacted the many , many people she knows who use canidae , and they have all had issues , many have taken their dogs to the vet , and have all now switched to a different food . . . not made by canidae . it's too bad they chose to make this change ; they have lost countless loyal customers over trying to save money on rice . i can't imagine they will be in business much longer . * * * * * * * * updated 10 / 2 / 08 : i've moved all my dogs to california natural . my breeder has also switched her dogs to california natural . so far everyone is doing great . . . after the canidae got out of their systems .

acquired a taste , now i love these the first time i tasted cacao nibs i thought they were very strange . but , after seeing on doctor oz that these are healthy and may help boost metabolism , i tried them again . now , i look forward to my 2 tablespoons a day . i should mention that i am basically a chocolate lover , but when i tried these the second time around i had given up my daily dose of dark chocolate . perhaps that was what helped me get over the fact that these have no sugar - - i was no longer used to eating the sweet chocolate , so this no longer seemed bitter to me . i now use these in baking , as well . i put the wet ingredients of a recipe into a blender with one or two tablespoons of the nibs and process the ingredients until the nibs are grounded down and no longer chunky , and people are amazed at the way my chocolate cakes taste !

these were resisted until amazon requested a review now they are open they are unlikely to last . good quality and not stuck together , not as expensive as some other brands .

picture does not show product why post a picture of items you are not selling ? i get very frustrated with sellers who use a stock photo of general items instead of the actual items they are selling . it isn't difficult to take a picture of the actual item - or search for a stock photo of the actual item you are selling . what is even * more * frustrating is that they don't bother to list the flavors you are buying since the photo is not accurate . the picture shows six different flavors of activate . i actually thought i was receiving all six since activate has many more than six flavors . i thought that is what " variety " meant . i received three bottles each of four different flavors . are they relying on their legal disclaimer to diffuse their laziness ? " actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website . we recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented . . . " even so , that does not say the product is different than the picture . i bought this product because i saw the exotic berry flavor at wal - mart . tried it , and thought it was pretty good . but i don't live near a wal - mart and have not seen it elsewhere . i rate amazon's employee who posted this item with one star since i don't see another way to rate the seller right now . if i easily find a way of rating the seller , i will change my star - rating here . the exotic berry flavor is fine . it is the only flavor i have had . the other flavors shipped in the box are lemon - lime , orange , and fruit punch . had i known that blueberry and pear were not included , i would have purchased a different package from amazon - one where the employee bothered to find the right stock photo of the item being sold .

did not increase milk supply did nothing for my milk supply , even though i had 8 cups of tea a day . tastes pleasant enough ( thankfully , it tastes more like lavender to me than fennel ) , but even though i like tea in general and drink a variety of it every day , it's not pleasant enough for me to drink just for enjoyment . only if i have to - provided it helps me with the supply . it doesn't * . i did a " subscribe and save " for 1 time a month for this tea , and amazon sent the second gigantic box to me 18 days after the first one . now i am stuck with two boxes of tea that doesn't help me and isn't yummy enough to drink every day just for fun . * i purchased fenugreek and blessed thistle in capsules and they helped a lot .

aromatic rooibos tea in a metalic air tight can . i heard some people complain that their rooibos tea smell evaporates when they buy it in bulk in a paper bag . the tea comes in a great metallic container with a lid that seals tight . i kept it on a kitchen counter for about 2 months after opening it and it was fine . in fact , my tea expired in 3 august , 2010 and i just opened it up in february i think , still great smell and taste . you want to use some kind of fine sifter ( tea holder ) as the particles are pretty small if you never had this kind of tea before . rooibos tea has no caffeine , and is a great tea to drink in the pm or late hours , it has a mild pleasant aroma , and reddish / rusty red color to it . it is full of antioxidants and protects the liver from foreign invaders ( helps to detoxify bad substances ) . 3 . 67oz in a jar = 104 grams " with classic bergamot citrus " from western cape in africa . organic . loose tea . ingredients : 100 % organic fair trade certified rooibos , natural essential bergamot oil . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = j ethnopharmacol . 2011 jan 7 ; 133 ( 1 ) : 46 - 52 . epub 2010 sep 15 . effects of rooibos ( aspalathus linearis ) on oxidative stress and biochemical parameters in adults at risk for cardiovascular disease . marnewick jl , rautenbach f , venter i , neethling h , blackhurst dm , wolmarans p , macharia m . sourceoxidative stress research centre , faculty of health and wellness sciences , cape peninsula university of technology , bellville , south africa . marnewickj @ cput . ac . zaabstractethnopharmacological relevance : in south africa , the plant aspalathus linearis ( brum . f ) dahlg . ( fabaceae ) is traditionally used as a " tea " referred to as rooibos or redbush . this plant has been listed as a medicinal plant based mostly on anecdotal evidence . aims of the study : despite a long history of traditional use in south africa , very little scientific data are available from controlled clinical trials confirming its popular use . the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of rooibos on biochemical and oxidative stress parameters in adults at risk for cardiovascular disease . materials and methods : after a washout period of 2 weeks , 40 volunteers consumed six cups of fermented / traditional rooibos daily for 6 weeks , followed by a control period . blood biochemical parameters indicative of antioxidant activity and content ( total polyphenols ) , lipid peroxidation ( conjugated dienes - cds , thiobarbituric acid reactive substances - tbars ) , redox status ( total glutathione - tgsh , ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione - gsh : gssg ) , lipid profile ( total cholesterol , low density lipoprotein - ldl and high density lipoprotein - hdl cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels ) and liver and kidney function were measured at the end of each study period . results : plasma antioxidant capacity was not altered , but plasma total polyphenol levels increased significantly after rooibos consumption compared with the control levels ( from 79 . 816 . 9 mg / l to 89 . 814 . 1 mg / l ) . significant decreases in plasma markers of lipid peroxidation were found after rooibos consumption , as reported by levels of cds ( 167 . 329 . 5 nmol / ml vs . 108 . 820 . 1 nmol / ml ) and tbars ( 1 . 90 . 6 'mol / l vs . 0 . 90 . 3 'mol / l ) . reduced glutathione ( 797238 'mol / l vs . 1082140 'mol / l ) and the gsh : gssg ratio ( 4114 vs . 7617 ) were both significantly increased after consumption of rooibos . the lipid profiles showed that rooibos consumption , compared with the control values , significantly decreased serum ldl - cholesterol ( 4 . 61 . 3 mmol / l vs . 3 . 90 . 7 mmol / l ) and triacylglycerols ( 1 . 70 . 8 mmol / l vs . 1 . 20 . 7 mmol / l ) , while hdl - cholesterol ( 0 . 90 . 1 mmol / l vs . 1 . 20 . 2 mmol / l ) was significantly increased . conclusion : confirming its popular use , consumption of fermented , traditional rooibos significantly improved the lipid profile as well as redox status , both relevant to heart disease , in adults at risk for developing cardiovascular disease . copyright  2010 elsevier ireland ltd . all rights reserved .

i think it tastes just like equal , but requires knowing how to use it . this review is for the 1 . 7 ounce bottle . i bought some , because i do not like the fact that over 95 % of equal is dextrose , sugar ( only 1 . 7 % is aspartame ) . white sugar is a mix of dextrose and fructose . first off the white powder you get is sweet and tastes just like equal to me . for one gallon of tea i use 0 . 5 grams of the aspartame powder . if you use too much you will get the bitter taste . this is true also with equal , if you put too many packets in it tastes bad . i fixed this problem long ago , i never use just equal . in the early days of my usage i added white sugar . then later i found i could drop the sugar and replace it with sweet'n low . so to my tea i used 10 packets of equal to 4 packets of sweet'n low . you can drink as much as you like all day long without an after taste . so with the aspartame powder , to my 0 . 5 grams of the aspartame i add the 4 packets of sweet'n low . the real problem with powdered aspartame is it does not dissolve in water well . it is a very fine powder and can't break the water's surface tension . it tries to clump and even when not clumped it forms a cloudy water . you solve this by the same method of making gravy from starch . you put your powder in a small bowl and add water drop by drop and make a paste . then dissolve the paste in the water of your tea or whatever you are sweetening . but this is why the powdered aspartame is packaged with dextrose in the equal packets . so the particles of aspartame are separated by the dextrose particles . thus it dissolves .

bogus harissa , a poser this is nothing like the real thing ! i am unable to understand why the amount of positive reviews . i bought this since i was unable to find mustaphas in wegmans supermarket here in ny . to buy mustaphas online is expensive ! ! product price not so bad , but when the shipping is added it is quite pricey ( but well worth every cent ) please trust me on this it is worth it ! i buy mine in the pack of three saves a bit and i use them quickly , however if you really enjoy mina and are 5 star happy with it great ! ! i am happy for you . but i can say this with complete honesty once you have tried mustaphas i doubt you will ever want to buy any other . so how do i describe how wonderful a product mustaphas moccican harissa is ? and how the two compare ( they are so different ) mina is thin weak almost tasting like it came from a can . mustaphas is thick almost as thick as tomato paste with a beautiful deep rich flavor and color which is beautiful , the heat is wonderful , ( you must be able to enjoy the heat ) but it is not just raw heat , it is flavor a depth of flavor that almost allows you to picture mustaphas being made in small homemade batches by artisans who know the taste they are crafting the flavor will transport you ( no magic carpet required ) and you will find so many uses for it . again the flavor is rich sumptuous the level of heat can be adjusted by the amount you use it takes very little to enjoy the rich flavor and it melds with everything but it is hot . i could not find anything that i could use mina on , i tried , it was 9 . 00 for the jar and i felt i must try top like it but in the end i yet threw away a nearly full jar of mina in a household where even the youngest grandchildren love hot sauces and harissa ( in small amounts ) no one at all liked the mina product ! ! my fridge has many bottles of hot sauces , we go through so many , a big favorite is marie sharps one of the most flavorful hot sauces we have ever had discovered it years ago when in belize . i say this so that i might offer you a reference point of my personal taste . i do not mean to compare them as similar products , both are quite different except for astounding flavor , uniqueness , and quality . i hope that this review helps ( and that you will forgive the gramatical errors ) . please check out mustaphas available on the amazon site the jar does not show the name in a pronounced way the print that shows the name of the brand is small the words morrican harissa might help identify or just do a search . but look for it , try it , do not judge harissa by mina ! ! there can be no comparison between the two . if you are happy with mina so be it . but if it is the only one you have tried then try mustaphas take a chance , just be ready to buy a lot of it since you will find so many uses for it , and you will miss it when you run out to be sure . thanks for listening to sum it up , i do not like the mina product at all ! ! i will not belittle it anymore than i have . i would rather offer you positives and mustaphas is that positive to be sure . thanks again

be wary our two - year - old lab , who will eat anything ( almost literally ) , won't touch this stuff . even when we tried mixing it with food he was used to , he just ate around the taste of the wild . . . which is hard to do since the kibble is so small in size . after reading other reviews , we thought we'd try this stuff out , to give our pup a change of pace . well , now we have a full , 30 - pound bag of the stuff . . . wonder if there are any other uses for it ? a door - stop maybe ?

more " seasoned " than " pepper " i like this , but be sure to know the first ingredient is salt . the remaining ingredients are pepper , msg , and sugar . you really only taste the salt and msg . there is really not much pepper flavor .

dogs can't count but i can the item that i ordered was a " 35 pack value bag " but the value went down considerably when what i received was only 21 in each pack . that means , for two packages , i received 28 fewer than advertised - almost another whole package and certainly another package of 21 . either the listing or the price needs to change . still i rated the item as highly as i did because the ultimate customer is my dog and he loves them . so , if you order them , be sure to check the number in the bags you actually receive ( hopefully they'll correct the problem by then ) but treat your dog to them , without reservation !

charming and childlike a charming , rhyming book that describes the circumstances under which you eat ( or don't ) chicken soup with rice , month - by - month . this sounds like the kind of thing kids would make up while they're out of recess and sing over and over until they drive the teachers crazy . it's cute and catchy and sounds really childlike but is skillfully written .

olive oil sent was made in the year 2000 . yes , that is correct . i buy many things on amazon , and 99 percent of the time it is good . i checked the code on bottom of the can and it was made in 2000 . as i writing this it is 04 / 08 / 2011 . olive oil does not get better with age in a tin can . i went on the zoe website to see how to read the code on the bottom of the can . on the zoe website click on blog at the top right hand side . it had on my cans the l = lot number , 00 = year olive oil was made . i called amazon right away to report this to them , and explained where i found this information . they agreed with me and issued me a complete refund . i don't blame amazon for these old olive oil cans , but i do blame zoe ( new york city based company ) . they supply amazon , nationwide and slipped some old stock through thinking no one would notice . guess what i'm from new york city , i know how these guys operate . zoe may be good olive oil , but check the codes often . you can find the code information on any company website .

mexi - cola is the one for me ! i tried this when i first started avoiding high fructose corn syrup . i needed my coke fix , so i tried the mexi - coke and didn't care for it much at the time . fast forward a few months with no soda . . . i tried mexi - coke again and fell in love . i really enjoy it a lot now and if i ever happen to drink regular coke with hfcs , it tastes nasty in comparison ( like dirt or something ) . that having been said , i cannot believe the price here on amazon ! ! i can get a case of 24 for around $ 20 at my local warehouse store . or , i could go to one of many tiendas or coffee shops and buy single mexi - cokes for $ 2 - $ 2 . 50 . what a rip off , amazon ! not cool at all .

not the same as regular godiva i love white chocolate . but i have to say , that they should put in the description that the insides of these are not the same as the insides of the regular milk or dark chocolate godiva . most of them have raspberry or strawberry filling . i dont like raspberry or strawberry . i would have much preferred the regular chocolate filling , or caramel / nut filling they have in the milk and dark chocolate pieces .

does not fit in senseo coffee maker with a lot of cautious effort it is possible to lock the melitta pod in the senseo coffee maker's holder area . once you have done that without breaking the lever handle the coffee brew comes out regularly . the taste of the melitta coffee is excellent ; betterthen the senseo ( dark roast ) i used to order through amazon . unfortunately the senseo pods - dark roast - are not available anymore . that's a good thing though , because once you taste the melitta you don't want to go back to senseo ! i still give it a five star despite the bad fit for the senseo coffee maker . the package says that it will " fit all coffee pod brewers " . once again , be careful closing the lid of your senseo brewer .

to each their own so first off , i'm not going to pretend that i'm not a rhonj fan , i am . i also would like to state that although i learned about blk from the show i did not try it to bag a manzo boy . i'm trying to make a change in my life , diet wise , and i've heard of the wonderful benefits of fulvic acid and decided to try it . i live in nyc so rather than drive all the way to jersey for a single bottle of water i ordered the case . not gonna lie , i was freaked when i ordered it . loads of people were saying that it had a metallic taste but i figured what the hell . so my case arrived today and when i opened it i immediately thought , this is pretty awesome looking , i hope it tastes good . my sister and i cracked one open and smelled , nothing . poured some out , it appeared to have the texture of * gasp * regular water ! ! so than the big test came , taste . we counted to three and took a sip each and . . . it tasted like regular old water . no metallic taste , no grittiness , nothing . everyone has a different palate so i don't doubt that these other reviewers did experience that but we didn't . try it for yourself instead of taking others' word for it . i'm definitely switching from poland spring to blk .

organic brown rice syrup containes arsenic i'm a mother of 19 months old and started using this formula when my son was about 9 months and used it for about 3 - 4 months till he switched to a cow's milk . i did tons of research before deciding on this formula . i thought it was the best one on the market . i have recently found out about a study that published horrifying results about organic brown rice syrup ( the main ingredient in baby's only used as a sweetener in organic food products as an alternative to high fructose corn syrup ) . the researchers found that the two baby formulas that contained brown rice syrup had arsenic levels that were far above the epa standard for drinking water and more than 20 times greater than each of the 15 formulas that didn't contain brown rice syrup . these products were baby's only organic dairy toddler formula and baby's only organic soy toddler formula , both made by nature's one . arsenic levels in the two formulas were also higher than the world health orgnanization's " maximum tolerable daily intake " standard for babies , who are particularly vulnerable to arsenic's neurological effects because of their small size and developing brain . as a mother , i feel dreadful to realize i was giving my child something that could be harmful to him . i just want to warn other mothers about the results so they can make a wise decision .

looks strong taste like vanilla water i tried the red bush pomengranite and it was quite awesome . full of flavor but not this tea i have put two bags and let it sit for 20 minutes and it still lacks taste on the front end . you catch the vanilla on the back and it is very subtle to the point of where is the taste ? i am drinking it as i write this and still find that red bush tea has very little real flavor . for people who are used to black tea or expresso it would be a joke . i only drink herbal teas but i would suggest you try any other flavor . the bengal spice and pomegranite are excellent . i have to describe the taste is sort of a light tobacco taste ( not a smoker ) with very mild vanilla and lackluster flat taste ( plain or water downed ) base even though the color is deep rich and red . i like the health benefits and will keep buying red bush but not this flavor .

not the real thing i am originally from europe ( germany ) and love italian cooking . after moving to the states , i have a hard time finding the ingredients that i was used to get easily there in the american grocery stores . if i can find them , they are overpriced and of inferior quality ( parmigiano reggiano anyone ? ) . i often feel that people are knowingly tricked by the industry by product names which resemble the " real product " , the best example would be olive oil . happy of at least finding one of my favorite pasta brands ( " dececco " ) , i was looking for the san marzano tomatoes which i was used to get at my local italian grocery store for 1 . 50 euros ( about 1 . 80 usd ) a can ( the acidity of most american canned tomatoes is too high , in my opinion ) . so far , i have only found this brand at the local grocery stores , and after reading the label , i was very suspicious about it - a san marzano tomato , produced in usa ? i gave it a chance anyways , at last , they have a high price and they are still on the market , so they might have something going for them . after opening the can , i instantly saw that these can not be real san marzano tomatoes - san marzanos are long and thin and bittersweet ( once you tried them , you will be able to tell ) , these are spherical and sweet and sour . i have used them in soup and pasta sauces so far , at least they seem to be a little better than the regular canned tomatoes in the grocery store , but it can not justify the price tag - in europe i can get this quality for about a dollar . so if you are searching for a good canned tomato , keep on searching - these here might not taste all that bad , but they are not san marzanos and they are expensive as well .

my aussie kinda likes them my 5 - year - old australian shepherd , pete , has put on a lot of weight in the last 18 months , so i was curious to see how he would take to a low calorie treat . i placed a regular size milk bone , a small beggin' strip , and a zoe treat stick side - by - side on the carpet and invited pete to help himself . being wary like most aussies , he cautiously sniffed each offering , then took the milk bone . when he was finished with the milk bone , he picked the beggin' strip . finally , when there was only one choice left , he took the zoe treat stick . i did this test with him four times to see if he would develop a taste for the zoe treat sticks , but the results were always the same . from a health and caloric point of view , the zoe treat sticks may be the better choice , but pete's interested in them only if nothing else is available . i suppose that's true of people and diet food too . at any rate , pete gives 'em 2 stars .

nice texture , processed flavor to me velveeta tastes like those tin foiled christmas cheeses found in those sausage gift packages : so if you like those christmas cheeses you will probably like velveeta . i like this cheese , but its processed flavor gets to me after a while . from what i understand velveeta is not vegetarian , for those who are concerned about such things . 3 . 75 stars .

my impulse cost me this time i like rich , bold coffee . i have been buying coffee through amazon , the keurig site , costco , and even in a grocery store when i run low . i am searching for the best cup for my taste . neumann's own is the best so far . this sampler was appealing as a way to try many bold k cups without commiting to much to one brand . what i failed to do was recognize the price which was almost $ 1 per k cup ( twice as much as other purchases ) and realize the sample pack would include decaf ( which i did not want ) . next time i will not let my impulse cost me .

good oats , bad containers these oats are fine and the price is quite competitive . the container is rather flimsy and did not stand up well to forces of shipping . you can submit a shipping rating ; however , there is no opportunity to tell exactly what the problem was . the six containers were in a box which were put in a larger box with other items . there was not much packing in the larger box . the oatmeal containers were bent and one of the protective seals was actually broken .

worthless i'm giving this product 1 star only because you force your customer to give a minimum of 1 star . actually if i could , i would give it a negative number , but i 'm not sure if your agents even know what that is . i was told by your agents that this product is 100 % vegan . for those agents at amazon who have no idea what 100 % vegan means they can try 100 % vegetarian . or it contains no animal products . i spent over $ 100 . 00 on this product & it still contains item ( s ) my dog is allergic to . so now i am out $ 100 . 00 for a product that will cost me $ 500 . 00 for the vet to treat ! which really means i'm out $ 600 . 00 out of my pocket to treat my dog @ the vet , ( veterinarian ) to give him the very expensive antibiotics , the very expensive antifungal medicines , the very expensive ointments , the very expensive anti - itch medicines , the very expensive steroids , the very expensive 2 special shampoos , the very expensive multiple special baths required as well as the multiple visits to the vet to cure him again ! if your staff are not vet pharmacists or dog allergists , they have no right to be giving out medical advise for animals or for humans !

wellness core grain - free dry dog food , original recipe , wellness core grain - free dry dog food , original recipe is a wonderful product . i have a german sheppard guide dog and she has allergies to rice , it was hard finding products that didn't contain any rice or grain products . i tried the wellness core and my dog loved it and had no stomach distress . it cost approximately $ 9 . 00 less than what i paid at the store , and no shipping charge . however on my second purchase they wanted to charge a shipping fee of $ 10 . 00 . needless to say i went to the store to purchase it .

great product horrible shipping price cheri's prickly pear syrup is far and away the best prickly pear syrup you can buy . but when you charge $ 9 for shipping a 12 oz bottle ? ? ? everytime i'm down in az i always buy pleanty of extra bottles and ship a few to friends . and i've never spent half this price to ship a bottle anywhere in the lower 48 states . i mean , c'mon , the usps provides boxes , tape and labels to send the stuff priority mail . if you're desperate for cheri's syrup and don't mind waiting a few extra days for " processing " before it even gets mailed out , what the heck , go for it . after all , it's only money , right ?

50 - 50 made a pasta puttanesca last night to pour over the miracle noodles that i recently bought . they aren't a wheat noodle but they are a passable substitute . at least for me . my wife didn't care for them and i will be finishing up the remaining packages on my own . the texture is similar to a rice noodle but they have almost no flavor of their own . the sauce didn't stick to the noodles as nicely as it does with regular pasta and because of this , the finished dish didn't look all that appetizing . i will try a red sauce next time in hopes that it will make for a better presentation . i give it a thumbs up for anyone trying to cut carbs . my wife a definite thumbs down based on appearance and texture .

it helped the spider i've personally seen mr . trivedi turn poor quality champagne and wine into great tasting stuff , and i've experienced the uplifting effects of his energy transmissions , so i have every reason to believe in the powers of the trivedi water . because i am receiving energy transmissions from mr . trivedi , plus drinking the water and taking trivedi probiotics , it's hard to determine which of the amazing effects are due to the water , the energy transmissions , or the probiotics , but i can tell this story about the water : i accidentally scalded a large spider in my bathtub . i really hate doing that , because i like spiders . i fished him out of the water , but he looked limp and dead . i watched him for a really long time and was sad that he never moved . i put a very small amount of the trivedi water on him and left , and when i came back , he was gone . he obviously got up and walked away .

good passion fruit flavor , good pulp , little green tea , lots of sweet i'm a big fan of most of the alo brand of aloe juices so i figured i'd try out this version by chantea , especially since i'm a big fan of passion fruit . right off the bat the chantea has a nice aroma , very sweet and fruity . like most aloe drinks , the chantea is very high in sugar ( cane sugar , not hfcs ) at 28g per bottle - to put that into perspective , a can of regular coke has about 39g . if this is one of your only sources of sugar , it's not too bad , but just don't get it into your head that this is super healthy either . if you've never tried an aloe drink , the first thing you should know is that they contain what can only be described as " slimy chunks " mixed in . if eaten directly from the aloe plant , this stuff is unbelievably bitter - hence the need for tons of sugar . the bits themselves aren't really appetizing to the american palate . if you're used to asian food , you'll probably have less of a problem ( it reminds me of large tapioca chunks ) . if you eat japanese food , it's sort of like really soft konyaku . the passion fruit flavor was pretty strong , but unfortunately the green tea was not . if you like drinking some of the bottled green teas by companies like lipton or snapple , you won't find the flavor any different . however if you were hoping for a true green tea flavor , you won't find it here . all in all , the chantea isn't too bad , but i think i still prefer the alo - and that's only because there's a particular flavor i like .

definitely not my idea of xtra large this was thin , unlike the last xtra large that i ordered from this supplier . i think it will still work for the dog to chew , at least until is shrinks 2 inches or so . since my dog is a mastiff , i'm afraid that he'd try to swallow the thing whole if it gets too much smaller , due to its thin diameter . so far , he hasn't shown much interest in chewing it . i think he likes the taste of the elk and moose antlers better .

zico water is good but not in a plastic container ! i love drinking zico's coconut water . in camparison to all others , i find zico's is the closest to fresh coconut water speaking from experience as i'm from an island which frequently have coconut water as a beverage . however , their packaging certainly makes a difference do not purchase zico's coconut water packaged in a plastic bottle as that's the taste you'll experience " plastic " . zico's carton packing is much , much better ! ! ! enjoy

no sweetener . love it . the facts : * tastes like crushed seeds . * texture like crushed seeds . * looks like crushed seeds . * mixes about as well as crushed seeds ( starts to settle after a few seconds ) . my opinion : * love it . * this is the only protien powder i have found that doesn't have ridiculous amounts of sweetener , none in fact . * taste is somewhere between broccolli and seedy / nuts . not delicious but not bad tasting either . * it settles quickly . no big deal : swish the container when you take a drink . * be sure to rinse your container so that the dish washer can take care of the rest . * don't use too much at once because it has a lot of fiber .

not the best sender for emergen - cs ! my roomate was getting sick so i thought some emergen - c would really help ! didn't get it anywhere close to on time . ordered this from americarx from amazon prime ( 2 - day shipping ) on september 27th . after some emails , it was eventually shipped on october 14th . didn't get it for another week . i would stay away from this vendor . i give them two stars because the product was at least what i asked for - although 3 weeks late ! about the emergen - c , this stuff is awesome . tastes good and really makes you feel better . i think raspberry is the best flavor . i would definitely recommend taking it at the first sign of feeling sick . 
=================
try it with yogurt for more flavor i suggest trying it with yogurt , and skipping the milk and butter all together if you prefer a stronger flavor . i like strong cheeses and sharp cheddar , i also appreciate a thick and creamy mac & cheese . 1 / 4 a cup of plain yogurt ( or to taste ! ) is worth a try .

change the image for chicken flavor i thought the chicken was going to be hard like chicken jerky , but instead it is completely different . the chicken is very soggy , flimsy , and smells terribly bad . plus they should change the picture for the chicken flavor , because that's not the correct bag . in the picture the chicken looks hard and tasty , but when i received this it looks completely different . i got this for my pomeranian , but he despises it . but he likes other chicken treats that look like the one in the picture . if you think your dog likes chicken flavored treats don't get him / her this one . i am rating the product on the way they display it . not on the actual treat because pomeranian's are picky . just get this . ( dogswell vitality for dogs ) . if you think their to big then break them into smaller pieces . it may be more expensive , but it's a whole lot better . i contacted zukes and they said the pictures that amazon shows are old and not updated . they told me they are supposed to be this way , but no biggie because they send me 2 replacement bags and samples of the prime venison strips , very berryz , and mean greenz dog treats . my dog likes all of the samples but not the chicken still . get the venison instead of the chicken . much better . excellent service !

too rich i fed my champion shetland sheepdogs this food for over six months . a few of my dogs did alright on it but others had loose stools and lost on average 2 pounds from the previous year . upon giving more food to gain weight the dog's got even looser stools . i e - mailed the company about it and never got a reply . coats were shiny but not good enough for show competition . since taking my dogs off this food they have gained weight and coats are coming in to the point i can show them again soon . i do like the philosphies of this company with regards to ingredients but makes me wonder if no grain at all is such a great thing .

great product - poor packaging we have bought earth's best organic baby food in a department store previously . after discovering our baby liked it , we went to amazon to compare prices and larger quantities . the baby food is great , no complaints at all . the packaging was sub par . the first thing we noticed was the exterior box wasnt taped or sealed ( it was a clamshell type box that folds over and you insert part of the box back into itself - anyone could have opened the package and closed it again ) . the jars are shrink wrapped with a cardboard base . the exterior packaging appears undamaged . inside there were broken jars of food - and grocery items are not returnable . we have contacted amazon's customer service and am waiting a response .

i like that it is vegan , but hate that it has a boring flavor i tried the rocky road flavor and while it is not awful , it is nothing to rave over . when something is described as a " sinfully healthy snack " , i expect it to taste magical and leave me in awe that it only has 140 calories . these small bars are not decadent or sinfully healthy . they taste like unsweetened no - bake cookies to an extent and have a slight vitamin aftertaste that frequently accompanies protein and nutrition bars . inside the bar , i found a couple of nuts but everything else melded together and if it were a blind taste test , i would never guess them to be rocky road inspired . nutritionally , i don't think this bar is great . for a small 140 calorie bar , it has a good deal of fat ( 8g ) and sugar ( 9g ) . if you insist on trying these and they are out of stock here , you can get your halo bar fix on iherb . com . you can use code lek375 for a discount . this product is made in the united states .

jazz up the decaf the first time i heard about decaf ( on a sitcom ) , i assumed it was a joke . yet , those bottled laughs weren't heard in the background . could it be . . . ? an american teacher later informed me that yes , there really is such a thing . decaf must be the most stupid invention in world history . i mean , coffee without caffeine ? ! that's rather like coke without cocaine . or tobacco without nicotine . or the democratic party without bill clinton . it lacks the active substance .

will never buy a different brand again i used to get these from sam's wholesale club , but with this economy , i have not renewed my membership . . so long story short , i bought bumblebee canned clams and they were horrible . . so then i bought geisha baby clams and they were not as horrible , but i certainly would not put them in my clam chowder , so i returned all the unopened cans of bumblebee and geisha and am never ever gonna buy them again . . . oh , you go right ahead and try those other brands if you don't mind eating poop . . 'cause that's about all you get . . clam juice , and clam poop . doxee snow's clams are all clams and clam juice no clam poop .

swanson vs apricot power apricot kernels why do you want apricot kernels ? if you want to lower your blood pressure , have a healthy snack . . . swanson kernels are fine for that . if you want kernels to treat cancer you need apricot power kernels . apricot power kernels are very bitter compared to swanson's . 
=================
actual sugar i love this gum . it's one of the few ( or only ) non - xylitol or similar sugar free ingredient based gums . that stuff gives me a stomach ache ( and worse ) so i can't chew anything that has it . luckily there's still freshen - up . this gum is still made with real sugar and is pretty close to the gum you may remember having as a kid . finding an ingredient listings online has proven difficult , but not impossible . the following is off my pack : ingredients : sugar , glucose syrup , gum base , invert sugar , ( some packs contain glycerin , my current case does not list it ) , artificial and natural flavoring , soy lecithin , red 40 lake and bht ( to maintain freshness ) . contains sulfites . made in brazil , distr . by cadbury brasil industria [ . . . ] / cadbury adams usa llc ( that's an abbreviated version of the distribution companies , but i like to know where things come from before i buy them , maybe you do too . ) i hope this flavor ( and brand ! ) will always be available . i've also bought the spearmint which is very tasty but not bubble gum . the kid in me can't help blowing bubbles sometimes and that's not possible with the other flavors . 
=================
not too happy with this . . . i was disappointed about how long it took to moisten the rice paper and how easily the papers cracked into pieces . i will buy a different brand next time .

beware of the recent price increases i have ordered several cases of similac sensitive from amazon . our baby went through several formulas before we found similac sensitive and she has been on it for several months now . i tried the powdered formula version of similac sensitive but the taste is different enough that my daughter went on a " milk strike " . i have been able to buy this off amazon for under $ 30 in the past with the subscribe and save discount but now i notice that the base price is more than $ 40 . its now cheaper for me to buy it off target or walmart ( even with the sales tax ) . i may still stick with amazon for the convenience of free home delivery but this may change .

didn't like the taste ; high protein / grain free = issues my family recently adopted a 15 lb . chihuahua mix who was found abandoned . . . we didn't know what she had eaten beforehand , but i'm guessing it wasn't anything high - quality due to the condition of her teeth and coat . my goal was to get her on a high - quality diet ( a " 6 / 6 " rating ) , and researched high protein / grain free diets and the benefits of them . additionally , i read up on innova / evo and understood that their products are extremely high quality , and someone else on a forum recommended we try the red meat small bite kibble with her . even at first sniff , my dog indicated she didn't like it . of course , i figure it would take some time , so i worked on transitioning her off of the other kibble she was on . it basically came down to the fact that she would only eat the innova evo when it was mixed in with some wet food , and oftentimes only with a bit of cottage cheese mixed in . shortly after being on this high - protein diet ( we didn't even finish her small bag of food ) , she began to urinate around the house , which she hasn't done in the 5 months we've had her . it turns out she had urinary crystals , which the vet attributed to the high protein levels of her diet . we had to put her on flagil , and the vet recommended i put her on hill's science diet c / d ( which i know is full of corn and grain fillers ) . after politely declining , i changed her diet to something more holistic that does have grain ( a " 4 / 6 " rating ) . she's fine now . . . innova / evo is an extremely high quality brand . . . perhaps it's better for larger and very active dogs . i know not all dogs may have this reaction to a high - protein diet , but i really think people need to understand that high - protein / no grain isn't always the smartest choice in terms of your dog's health . in our case , it turned out to be much more costly for us and more stressful for our dog to make this switch .

what's that smell ? i waited anxiously for this to arrive . the afternoon it came , i made a cup right away . a faint smell , similar to sewer gas or rotten egg smell , permeated my kitchen . since the kitchen is next to the laundry room , i thought maybe it was a sewer smell . but once i started sipping my new coffee , i realized it's the coffee . it smells only faintly , but it's such a repulsive smell i had to dump the rest of the cup . i am quite bummed that i have 2 boxes of this stuff . i think i will buy a bottle of kahlua , and add a splash to a cup of this stuff . maybe that will help me get through the 47 more kcups i have . i read all these reviews on this site , and half the people seem to love the coffee ( and not get a bad odor ) . . . the other half seem to get the bad odor and hate the coffee . are there 2 suppliers , with differing ingredients ? i strongly , strongly recommend trying to get a sample of this before shelling out the money for a full box of these kcups . 
=================
good seeds , but beware if you have a milk allergy i've tried david , spitz , and biggs sunflower seeds before giving the giants brand a try . the seeds are large and the flavoring is not too intense or too light . so the seeds taste good and are of a good quality . i haven't noticed much in the way of plant debris or empty seeds . i must give this product four stars for two reasons : 1 . unlike the spitz seeds , you cannot reseal these bags after opening them . spitz uses resealable bags for their seeds . giants does not . this means you have to eat the seeds quickly or else they will get stale . 2 . in this variety pack , several of the flavors use milk as an ingredient . specifically , the zesty italian , dill pickle , and dakota ranch flavors list milk as an ingredient . the dakota ranch flavor also lists cheese as an ingredient . there was no way of knowing this based on the product advertisement . i tried the zesty italian flavor and now have a stomachache because of the milk ingredient . i had high hopes for these seeds . they do taste good , but if you are allergic or sensitive to certain ingredients or wish to have a resealable bag , i would recommend spitz over giants , but giants over biggs and biggs over david .

new universal grow pods are awful i have had several aerogardens over the last four years . i recently purchased two new 7 pod gardens ( pro 100 ) . up to this time i was a satisfied customer albeit you have to either read up on what grows best or just practice a lot . recently i received new universal grow pods that are supposed to fit in all the aerogarden models . despite what customer service says they do not fit well in my 7 pod . worse is that the new grow pods do not hold the grow medium near the top of the pod . the new universal pods promote mold and rot and discourage germination . up to this point i would have highly recommended this product but not now or until they create a better grow pod .

warning ! taste burnout likely i had not had a slim jim in 3 years . i brought these to quench my childhood thirst for this snack . i ate all 100 of them in about 18 days . i don't want to see another slim jim ever again in my life . the product was good though so no complaints .

nescafe bring back the flavored coffee canisters ! i know there are many people who want taster's choice instant vanilla and hazelnut coffee to be manufactured in the canisters once again . if you are tired of paying so much for a box of 20 sticks , call nescafe at 1 - 800 - 505 - 2876 and let them know !

different i must admit they don't taste much like regular shells but since i can't have wheat anymore they serve the purpose .

misinformation in description the water is very good , though i agree with other reviews that the price is high and a different variety of flavors would be welcome . however , the description of the product says there are twelve 16 - ounce bottles , which is correct , but the breakdown given indicates it comes with 4 each of the four flavors instead of 3 each . a small but glaring mistake ! hint essence water variety pack , 16 - ounce bottles ( pack of 12

slightly medicinal taste i tried this as a cheap alternative for choffy but i found that these cacao nibs have an unpleasant medicinal taste . i've prepared it straight up and mixed with coffee . my usual method is to grind it in a coffee grinder and then brew it in a french press . after it's brewed i mix it 50 / 50 with frothy milk that i've made with a bodum milk frother , bodum chambord milk frother . choffy and coffee is a great combination , the navitas cacao and coffee isn't .

price is too high for 18 payday kingsize ( 3 . 4 oz ) bars . i thought i could save money by buying online to get my favorite payday kingsize candy bar but however i searched i found i cannot get a reasonable wholesale price . i just came back from nm where i went to a wallmart and purchased payday kingsize bars for only $ 1 . 00 each retail . this is for the kingsize 3 . 4 oz candbar . i guess wallmart really has the buying power and can out do the candy distributors . so now i must go to a local wallmart and stock up again . who knew ? by the way they are good even if they are made by hershey now . i remember the originals by hollywood brands of centralia , il when i was a kid in the 60's and i think they tasted better .

enzyme oral hygiene chews i cannot attest to the results purported yet by this product but my cats love them . our younger male cat , 3 years , especially loves them and will gnaw on a whole one of these 'treats' . he even got into the bag when we were gone and ate 5 ! the other cats did not seem interested because they are ridiculously large almost 2 " x 0 . 5 " . the are wrapped in a wafer paper like material with a flaky , wafery , crumbly , stuff inside . to feed the other cats , i applied pressure to the wafer and rolled it back and forth between my fingers to break it out of the 'shell' . i do this and add it to their food or put it separately on their plate like an side dish in addition to their wet meal and they love it , go nuts for it . i associate it with / like brushing our teeth after we eat . they eat their main course , have dried bonito flakes on the side , and then have a side of these flaky chews ( not really chews at all , like a crepe rolled up tight ) . i have only recently made this purchased and started using this product so cannot provide evidence for , or against , the claims of the product regarding pet hygiene and dental health but will post an update later in time . is it weird i kinda like the smell of them . . . ?

when in doubt , drink the original ! it's summer . it's so muggy you can see the steam rise off the pavement . yep , you're in the semi - tropics now . it's new orleans and the living is easy . and it is 8 o'clock in the morning . time for cafe au lait made with coffee and chicory and a plate of beignets dusted with powdered sugar . it's the chicory that gives cafe au lait its robust , mellowed down flavor . chicory ? what is chicory ? thought you would never ask . i just happen to have that answer right here : from wikipedia : " root chicory ( cichorium intybus var . sativum ) has been in cultivation in europe as a coffee substitute . the roots are baked , ground , and used as a coffee substitute and additive , especially in the mediterranean region ( where the plant is native ) , although its use as a coffee additive is also very popular in india , parts of southeast asia and the american south , particularly in new orleans . chicory , with sugar beet and rye was used as an ingredient of the east german mischkaffee ( mixed coffee ) , introduced during the " coffee crisis " of 1976 - 9 . " chicory is also related to endive and raddichio . cafe au lait is strong coffee mixed half with hot milk , and sugar added as desired . there is nothing like it , especially when drunk in the atmosphere of new orleans .

can't make it taste good enough for a serious trial i can't tell you if this works as a diuretic , because it tastes so bad , i can't make myself drink enough of it for a decent trial . somebody must like it or they wouldn't keep making it , but it's not for me .

doesn't have splenda after all i had written a previous review in 2008 , stating how great i thought these were . i have changed my mind . even though it states under important information that it has splenda under the ingredients , lipton quietly changed these to aspartame at least two years ago . you will realize it after it arrives , as it does say aspartame on the box . it is fairly hard to find green tea stix with splenda , but i discovered arizona pomegranate green tea iced tea stix sugar free ( splenda ) , and that is what i drink now .

awesome i got my bonsai today but am kind of disappointed when i took it out of the box . it is a small tree and got a few leaves and look like it is drying out . i am not just sure if this was a result of being in the box for a few days or the seller sent it to me as i got it . when i ordered it i paid for expadite shipping but had to wait for 9 days before i got it . i am just greatly disappointed and won't buy from sheryls shop again . i am really frustrated and regret buying from them as i found out that they got this item from another seller . jan 26 , 2012 : i would like to update my review and am happy about the seller's action on replacing the bonsai . i got the replacement today and they replaced the old one with much better one . the new one has a lot of leaves as the picture shown and it looked healthy . so i replaced my rating from 1 star to 5 star .

top sirloin steak review received two gifts of omaha steaks for christmas and anxiously looked forward to a holiday meal of steak , twice - baked potatoes and apple tartlets . however , the steaks were tough and very disappointing - the potatoes and tartlets were delicious . my anticipation for future meals is now quite diminished . i will , most definitely , share my experience with the gift givers . ins't that a shame ?

i can't believe the price i happened upon this item by accident when looking at coffee makers . while i feel eight o'clock columbian is great coffee i can't believe anyone would pay this price for it . i just purchased four bags for ten dollars ( $ 10 . 00 ) at my local giant food store asit is on sale at two for the price of one . i always stock up when they have this sale which happens every few months .

great product . super slow shipping this product , starbucks via , is a starbucks product . it's good stuff . i live in seattle , the home of starbucks . this price was cheaper than anywhere i've found for this quantity so i ordered . i thought it would take a few days to get here in a plastic envelope . nope , 12 ( twelve ) days later it arrived and was shipped from tennessee with a packing slip with the official starbucks maiden on the invoice . come on , starbucks , does all of your roasted coffee ship to your coffee shops from the same location . . . . . no distribution centers or anything that could mail a package a little more efficiently . 12 days from time of order to receipt is a long time for a package . i mail letters from seattle to the southeast every week that arrive in 3 days . this was slower than media mail . 
=================
had no problem . they like this one a lot i wondered why my 10 - month olds liked this one so much when the other reviews weren't so promising . then i noted that it has twice the calories as the green bean casserole and sweet ingredients that are proven winners with my kids . here's the ingredient list : water , organic carrots , organic mango puree , organic finely ground chicken , organic whole grain brown rice flour , organic yellow split pea flakes , calcium carbonate . anything that starts with carrots and mango is going to be fairly sweet , and this one is sweet . the consistency seemed very normal , perhaps because it has plenty of water - that's the first ingredient . unlike most earth best flavor brands , this one has calcium . the stated amount is 35 % of their daily needs . i've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult . i recommend this particular one , chicken mango risotto , because i think babies will tend to like it as mine did . these cases are being delivered to my home constantly , different varieties of earth's best subscriptions . on occasion a case will arrive in a mess with one or more broken jars . over time i figured out it would cost the vendor too much to package these jars well enough to ensure no breakage . now when a case arrives with one or more broken jars , i report it and can get credited for the broken ones only . of course it's messy when a jar is broken , but i don't have a store nearby that sells this product except one that lists it at a higher price .

not as advertised i just received my order of 100 count regular bully sticks and am extremely disappointed . " only valuepetsupplies bulk bully sticks are hand measured for consistent thickness " . i beg to differ . the " regular " size is quoted as 9 / 16 " thickness . the product i received is less than 4 / 16 " in thickness . out of 100 pieces , less than five actually measured up to the regular thickness advertised . my blue heeler dispatched one piece in less than a minute . it usually takes him five minutes . on the other hand , my toy fox terrier is still working on hers and won't leave leftovers for the big guy to clean up . while i understand that valuepetsupplies . com sponsors good causes , i will be spending an extra 15 cents per piece and get a much more substantial treat .

made my heart pound ? i bought this tea at stop and shop and it clearly has warnings on it but i didn't expect it to cause like a panic attack or something uncomfortable like my heart to beat loudly as it was audible . i don't fancy the flavor of this tea . yogi makes a sampler with this one in it .

wanted to like this stuff , but hurt wifey's tummy i love that it is american made from renewable sources ( birch trees ) , and the taste is great ( better than splenda or stevia ) - - absolutely indistinguishable from sugar . however , a couple of days of use had my wife cramping and a bit distressed in the nether regions . now the canister stands a bit sadly unused ( hey , don't look at me - - i like sugar ! ) . 
=================
not like the others i bought this tea as a gift based on the fact that all the other stash teas i've personally tried have been good , and several months later after the initial disappointment we are still trying to make it come together right . the problem with this one is that the chocolate does not blend right with the actual tea . the flavors are all there , but the chocolate unfortunately feels filmy and leaves a weird lingering taste . the package suggests adding milk and sugar to bring out the hazelnut . this works for that purpose but the chocolate still does not come out right in either flavor or texture . also , mixing the tea with hot chocolate overpowers the hazelnut . it helps to steep the tea bag in pure hot milk with no water added , though . 
=================
tongkatali ginseng coffee this product is ok . . there are so many varieties of this kind of coffee either too sweet or too bitter , this one is fine . . . as far as taste is concern , but i must admit that the only thing that is not so acceptable is its 'savage' mixture of fats and most probable 'gmo' structure . this is wrong , we should be very careful about it . .

senseo coffee pods this is a delicious coffee , very , very enjoyable . i enjoyed several packets of senseo decaf , regular & vanilla flavor . however , if you are a coffee addict , as i am , and start making and drinking 20 oz glasses of coffee , you will begin to develope four hour long deep seated headaches from this coffee . you cannot and will not function while enduring these headaches . i couldnt send the remaining coffee pods back , but i sent back the senseo coffee maker . - - - - - m . m . - - - i canceled my subscription to senseo coffee .

gone in 60 seconds . . . the dieter who couldn't eat a whole package in a day must have been eating these tasty little gems one by one , with a break inbetween each bite . not my family . we would each take a handful for a snack , and before we knew it , the bag was empty . but enough about the bag . these things are tasty and provide a concentrated strawberry punch of flavor which makes " strawberry flavored " items taste lame . with these , you get the whole range of flavors in a strawberry , sweet without being too sweet , and none of the acidic taste that you sometimes get in an underripe berry . the dried fruit is very crunchy , without any of the gumminess that shows the manufacturer removed them from the dehydrator too early . my only beef is the price , although i understand why they are so expensive . when i dried fruit , it took many pints of cleaned , stemmed and sliced berries to come up with a respectable amount of food . my family was always finished with one batch long before the next before the next was ready . when i consider the effort involved , these snacks are probably underpriced . but it still hurts to see an expensive packet gone before the commercials are over !

when it works , its great . we have had it less than three months . we have to descale about once a week . our water has 1 gram of hardness . almost perfect . they have sent new water reservoir ( which by the way keurig has great help line ) . but , honestly for the money the mr . coffee is better . you just have to add the water each time . but it works each time . it is very hard to get a consistent full cup of coffee out of this keurig machine .

all oats , not sweet i don't like my oats sugary , and if you agree , then these are for you . they are all oats , no other flour , and crisp and tasty . there are few crackers out there that are not wheat or not hard and stiff like flatbread . these are unique .

great expectations - unfortunate ending we have been purchasing wine kits locally for several years and recently began purchasing from amazon as our local source closed shop - until we processed this kit we have never had a bad batch - color was good , but there was a distinct odor and sharp taste to the finished product - the batch was scrapped .

my cat said , " no way ! " so , i bought this product to help my cat take a pill . it was the chicken flavor . it seemed like a nice alternative to using pill pockets . he ate the very first pill and that was it . i tried a few more times and it was almost as if he did not even recognize the product as food . i tried to email the company about the " flavor guaruntee " and the email was returned as undeliverable . bummer . . . honestly , my best alternative to help with pills are a product called , " lean treats " . i cut the pill into smaller pieces and break the treats in half . he likes these the best .

better than most gf crackers this is the closest thing i have found to a " water cracker " that's gluten free . there isn't any seasoning that would detract from or clash with whatever you put on this cracker , but for that same reason it doesn't really work well as a stand - alone , unless you just prefer a bland cracker . it's not at all salty . texture . . . well , it breaks a little too easily , and when you chew it , it feels more powdery in your mouth than what you'd probably think of for a cracker , but it's not bad . of the glutino crackers , we like glutino gluten free multigrain crackers , 4 . 4 ounce boxes ( pack of 6 ) best , because the fennel in the multigrain gives it a little more texture and taste . this is the only brand of gf cracker that my gluten - eating family will eat , other than sesmark ancient grains chips with parmesan herb , 3 . 5 ounce bags ( pack of 12 ) [ amazon frustration - free packaging ] and sesmark savory thins , original , 3 . 2 - ounce packages ( pack of 12 ) [ amazon frustration - free packaging ] - - but sesmark isn't marketed as gf , just as " no gluten ingredients .

surprise we are not beer drinkers so learning first off that this cannot be used in the bread mixer . . . did i miss that ? then to find i need to buy molasses and beer to make the bread . . . well it was not a happy surprise . i did it though and the result was very interesting . it is a heavy , dark bread with interesting flavor . crumbly and not for sandwiches but more like a breakfast bread .

this is trash . this is not food . check out the nutrition facts right below the product name on the amazon page . is the manufacturer hoping that uninformed consumers have heard the word omega somewhere and think that it's necessarily good for them ? nature's path does not tell us which omega 6s or omega 3s it contains . beneficial omega 3s are those that we get from foods such as tuna and flax . omega 6s are generally what we get from corn - fed stockyard beef . or from sitting down and swigging a bottle of peanut oil . note that this product contains 900 mg of omega 6s and 400 mg of omega 3s . more than twice as much of omega 6s as omega 3s . the typical , god - awful american diet contains a ratio of 20 : l omega 6s to omega 3s . nutritional scientists recommend that we drop this diet and try to get at least a 3 : 1 ration of omega 3s to omega 6s . large studies are indicating that omega 3s help the cardiovascular system , reduce inflammation , may have a helpful role in preventing cancer , improve depression in some people and may possibly be helpful in preventing or stabilizing some forms of dementias . are these studies far enough along to be conclusive ? no . are they pointing us in some healthy directions ? yes . are positive results encouraging more studies - not just lab studies , but human studies ? yes . the most positive results so far indicate that omega 3s are very good for our hearts . so , you get 2 grams of fiber from a product that supposedly contains granola , flax seed , raisins , hemp seeds and sunflower seeds . what are they using these fiber - rich foods for ? the box ? you also get 100 mg of sodium and 14 - fourteen - grams ! of sugar , along with some saturated fat . i've been looking for healthy snacks for my pregnant daughter and i'm shocked to see that there is no nutritional value in any of the bars produced by nature's path organic . i decided to check out nature's path cereals , etc . , and found the same garbage . the words organic , nature and nutrition have been prostituted by a lot of greedy companies , but this is the most egregious example i've seen in a while . i'd like to see amazon pull these products - if we stop buying them and the market disappears - so will the products . in the meantime , we need to keep educating ourselves and sharing what we learn . we need to keep up pressure on the grocery stores , supermarkets , food banks and places we go when we can't to get to or afford our co - op . we need to keep ourselves , our children , our grandchildren and our neighbors healthy , well - nourished and strong . best to all .

better than peanut butter ? lol whoever titled this product has a lot of nerve . it tastes like tapioca , which is exactly what's in it . 
=================
 $ 22 . 25 for 8 cans i love boysenberries , blackberries and mulberries . mm , mm mm , the darker the gentler . the light syrup is not too sweet so i don't mind spooning it in along with the berries . the berries are mushier than firm but not mush and still somewhat shapely . it was not difficult to finish a can . 
=================
no hydrogenated oils , but too sweet i love that this is a no - stir option without hydrogenated oils . i really hate stirring natural peanut butter . plus , oily peanut butter - yuck ! my only issue is that it's far too sweet . i got used to peanut butter without sugar . i also think the company is being a little deceptive . they say that there's " no added sugar , " but then admit in the description that there's cane juice . the carb count , for anyone who's interested , is 8 grams ( 3 grams of which are sugar ) per 2 tablespoons . whether it's cane juice or sugar or corn syrup , it's really all sugar . because of the over - sweetening and higher carb count , i probably won't be ordering from this company again , but if they ever make a no - stir peanut butter without any kind of sugar , i'll be the first in line . fortunately , i was able to turn the peanut butter into low - carb peanut butter cookies . the sweetness doesn't bother me as much in cookie form .

wow , that's a lot of millet ! um . . . you get a lot of millet when you purchase this . despite the size of the box ( standard cardboard box size , needlessly double - boxed from amazon ) , it was very light . each bag i'd say is a little smaller in volume than a box of kleenex , and you get 12 . it looks like more than it sounds when you get them ! the grains are very light and it's easy to have spills or overpours whether pouring out of the bag or from a secondary container . as for taste and texture , i agree what a reviewer of the nature's path version of this cereal said , that they are not toasted , just puffed . she put hers on a baking tray and toasted them to make them more crispy , instead of soft . i'm too lazy , and it seems like a possible waste of energy , so i just put up with it . that said , it doesn't really get soggy , either . just imagine unsweetened puffed rice , only broke into little 3 / 16 - inch balls . it just kind of relents when you crush it with your teeth , think really soft styrofoam ( ? ) . taste - wise , not much taste , but what taste there is , is good . tastes very similar - - surprisingly similar - - to puffed rice , just smaller . . . and not rice . healthier than puffed rice in my strong opinion . it's not substantial enough for me to just eat it straight in milk for breakfast , but that's not what i bought it for . i think i'm like most people who purchase this , in that i bought it to augment other cereals . i add it to my nature's path heritage flakes - - which are very hard flakes , too hard , and the millet being if anything 'too soft' , kinda ( ? ) balances that out sometimes . i like to mix different kinds of cereal , and this often gets thrown into the mix . unlike the big - o box of nature's path heritage flakes i bought , i'm not really sure i'll ever use all of this ! wow . i only bought it from amazon because i couldn't find it anywhere else . the heritage flakes have millet in them too , but it looks to be whole or cracked grain , not puffed - - and apparently not even turned into millet flour , which is disappointing . as for the hulls , there are some but they haven't caused a problem for me . the hulls are a thin skin , almost the same color ( very light brown or yellow ) , and in small pieces which i rarely if ever notice . i've also noticed that if you keep the cereal in the same vertical orientation , the hulls will , over time , migrate down . so if you're concerned ( and you don't need to be ) , maybe put them in a plastic container , and keep topping off the container , so you're always drawing from the top . in retrospect , i'd like to see a millet - based cereal which is not puffed , and is not just hard pieces of whole millet , but uses ground / milled millet in some kind of creative form , even if it's a flake . maybe i should start my own company .

boo i say . tabasco lies . first off , allow me quote the label . " tabasco habanero sauce is made from the world's hottest pepper . " what ? ! that's funny , i don't see the word 'jolokia' nor 'scorpion' anywhere in the ingredients . how is it legal to make such a blatantly false claim ? false advertising aside , i bought a bottle for thirty - five cents at my local grocer after it was on sale and had a coupon which doubled . the moment came and i shook the bottle into my mouth for a swig . . and . . . nothing . minutes later , another big swig ; a third of the bottle now gone . i waited patiently to no avail . maybe others would have been impressed with the hint of capsaicin , but not me . so , thankfully i didn't pay much for this tiny bottle of disappointment . maybe ithe positive reviewers drank a whole gallon and that's where i went wrong . yes , i am a shu snob , and if you need to look up what " shu " is , then this sauce is for you . even tabasco's website , which doesn't require a recall to correct , is loaded with inaccurate [ read deceitful ] claims . i've had hotter jalapenos from domino's pizza than tabasco's attempt at a habanero sauce . stick with the simple pickled red pepper juice and market your black pepper water toward the mainstream tabasco ; you're way out of your league . that said , this sauce is great for adding to baking soda and making cool volcanos with my kids . certainly not worthy of gracing my breakfast . but hey , this is just my opinion . much like tabasco's opinion on " the world's hottest pepper " ; no real merit . worth noting , this is only the second time i've ever been compelled enough by a product to take the time which i have little of to share my opinion .

picture is wrong , but tastes great . the duck was excellent , and in a way i am glad that the picture does not reflect the product . i may not have bought it if the picture looked like what you really get . however , because of the picture , i am writing a review . i expected the duck breast to be similar to what is shown in the picture . instead , the product was more in line with the images you get when you google " whole duck breast " , only the google images look better . the taste is similar to cow liver and bacon . i have only eaten duck when ordering at a restaurant , so i have no idea what it is supposed to taste like smoked , or even if the product i received was the correct thing . the packaging said eight ounce smoked magret duck breast , so i went with it . so , if you buy this product do not be put - off by what you see . slice it , sear the sides , and enjoy .

a little bit different type of mini wheat . when mini - wheats first came out in the grocery store , i tried them . however , i found they were bland . it was like trying to eat sticks in milk . then came " frosted " mini - wheats . okay , i decided to give it a go . now i had sticks and sugar in milk . however , i did find out that if you forego the milk and just eat them straight from the box , like potato chips , they are excellent ! now kellogg's has added fruity flavors to the mini - wheat . these i can eat in milk ! yippee ! finally ! i picked up the " strawberry delight " in bite size . even though i can eat them in milk , i find that i still prefer just to eat them straight from the box , like potato chips , a type of chex - mix , or square wheat thin snack . each serving has 140 calories . compare that to other cereals and you'll see it is about 60 - 100 calories less . no saturated fat . no trans fat . no cholesterol . no sodium . total fat is only 0 . 5g according to the box . i don't see how , since zero and zero is , well , zero . but i can live with 0 . 5g . here is the bad news , the carbohydrates . there are 35g of carbs here . but that is about the same as all the other brands . diabetics may want to pass on this due to the 10g of sugar per serving . and remember , a single serving is about the size of half a base ball . not much . so if you are just pouring cereal into a " cereal bowl " without measuring , you are probably getting 2 or 3 servings in that one bowl . all - in - all , unless you are diabetic , this mini - wheat is terrific ! reviewed by detra fitch of huntress reviews .

rook not trilled maybe sad . there were 28 coffees and 7 teas nothing else . i thought i'd get a selection . i wanted to try cocoa and apple cider but as many here have said there is no variety . there were 35 different products both dark coffee and medium . there were 6 flavored coffees and 4 decaf coffees . but not the wide variety i had expected . also although i have not used the product yet , as i have not been delivered the coffee maker , i'm wondering how they will taste as the cups are old . several of them are puffed up . i don't think they will be poison , but old coffee is not flavorful . don't buy this product or maybe you're just into russian roulette . just went from 2 stars to 1 . i ordered the bed bath and beyond 60 samples for $ 39 . 00 , and while their selection was just ok , a 3 . 5 star rating . its . 66c a k - cup while this is . 75c , bb & b's selections where fresher and there was some variety . ok i ordered more so the price was better but let me tell you the whole presentation was better , the product was better , fresher and i think it has this beat by 2 . 5 stars .

this gum is really great ! if you have problems with aspartame ( which is in every gum out there . . . not just sugarfree gums ) and you love to chew gum then steviadent is really the only option unless you want to eat tictacs . it is really good although quite expensive , but completely worth it to me so as not to compromise my health . i chewed every gum out there and lots of it , but had recently started to notice a painful lump on the roof of my mouth . my immediate reaction was . . . of course cancer , but i had 2 dentists and an oral surgeon check it out and all confirmed it was not . not only that , aspartame upset my stomach to the point that i had an extreme amount of bloating and gas every day . i didn't initially attribute either of these things to aspartame , but when i started to notice the lump was bigger and more painful upon chewing my old gum , i started doing my research and aspartame turned out to be the culprit . i ended up ordering a case of the steviadent and pitched everything i owned that contained asapartame . the lump on the roof of my mouth disappeared within 2 days of not ingesting aspartame and my stomach bloating and gas completely went away . worth spending the extra $ until more gums start making their product with stevia instead of aspartame .

no longer available i must agree with the previous review . i don't care for the new lipton tea to go with honey . i also hope it flops . the original tea to go was really good and i bought it all the time . amazon's price is outrageous . scalping at it worst .

high in sugar and carbs / low in protien while this protien shake is one of the better tasting i've had , it's not a real protien shake . this only has 10grams of protien compared to most shakes that have about 30g and up . the real " keep away " factor for me is that this shake has 29 g of carbs / 18 g of this is sugar . if you're serious about weight loss , there are much better protien shakes on the market . try eas whey protien - it comes in a bag and each serving contains 170 calories / only 3 grams of carbs and 30g of protein . i haven't tried chocolate but vanilla is very tasty , especially with ( skim ) or almond milk . in response to a user comment , yes this product is marketed as an " appetite suppressor " rather than protein shake - however , if you're trying to lose weight - you will need to avoid sugary products , such as this . spring for a protein shake with more protein and less sugar . the eas whey protein will not taste as good - special k drinks do taste much better - that is for sure ( 18 grams of sugar ! ) . sometimes as a 'treat' i will take 1 scoop eas whey protein ( chocolate ) , 1 banana , 1 cup almond milk and 1 cup ice - blend well in a blender - and you have a delicious and healthy protein shake .

our dogs now call them " puke's " ( this review was written by our dog , who isn't 13 , ( she's only two ) so she really isn't old enough to be allowedto write a review , but don't tell amazon ! ) they looked so darn good . and were really fun to chew on - i ate about a third of mineover a couple hrs , in different " chewing appointments " i thought . . . this is great ! then i felt kinda funny . . . and before i knew it - i threw upall over mom's rug in her officethree times . wow ! big gobs of it ! i didn't even eat that much ! it musta really swolled up in my doggie belly ! and later . . . that same afternoon . . . my sisterpup threw hers upall over the van . mom said no more zukes . dang . we kinda liked those pukes . at least til we got to thepuking part . mom was not amused .

poor tasting i can't slam this product because the ones i recieved from amazon are very stale ( although date says good through may of 2011 ) i think from poor storage in warehouse , so with that grain of salt , i found them to have a chemical taste . but i'm sure if they were fresh it would have been better . and if i were on a gluten free diet it would be great

amount of grains correct , shipped improperly , grains appear inactive i received the promised 3 + tablespoons of milk kefir grains , but the product was shipped in a plastic tub that had nothing , like tape , to keep it closed during shipment . as a result the product arrived in a plastic lined shipping envelope , but the plastic container had come open and what ( if any ) liquid was shipped with the product had spilled out along with the grains , inside the envelope , with only a few grains remaining in the plastic tub . simply adding some cellophane tape or shipping tape around the edges of the plastic tub lid / container would likely have kept the product contained properly during shipping . also the package was hot when it arrived . the grains " looked " large and healthy , if a little bit crushed , however i have tried making milk kefir 2 - 3 times since i received the product , according to the instructions included in the shipment , and the milk curdles very little , even if i leave the grains for two days , instead of just one . i'm hoping the grains are still just in shock . some grains seem to float while others sink to the bottom of the glass jar filled with fresh whole milk , that i cover using a rubber band and coffee filter , so the mixture can breath at room temperature away from any direct light . also the grains were in large clumps in the shipment or appeared to be , but now have broken down to much smaller clumps . the color of the grains is close to the color of milk . i'm hoping the grains that sink to the bottom aren't dead or totally inactive , but most milk kefir makers seem to indicate their grains float on the surface or the milk . i'll try making milk kefir for one more week , but if the milk still isn't curdling , then i'm afraid these grains arrived dead / inactive and likely never will become active . any buyers should be forewarned that the seller wants you to pay return shipping for a full refund and says they will not reimburse you for this cost , and this must happen within one week of receiving the product . i purchased water kefir grains from another seller that were shipped with liquid in a totally sealed plastic bag , that arrived unbroken - they have been making water kefir successfully in the same environment , so i'm certain that the environmental conditions are not a problem , also those water kefir grains have since doubled in volume ( grown ) . i am not using metal utensils , only plastic , nylon , or glass ( jars , strainers ) . it's now september 16 , 2012 . i had to give up on getting these milk kefir grains to work properly ( or at all ) . my water kefir grains i had received from another seller are now busting at the seems in productivity . they went from 3 - tablespoons to 2 . 5 quarts of water kefir grains by this time . i found a website that told you how to gradually convert water kefir grains to milk kefir grains , and using this technique i now have very effective working milk kefir / milk kefir grains . they don't grow as fast as the water kefir grains , but they do product milk kefir that's delicious and viable .

disappointing truffle this is the second brand of canned or bottled truffles . firstly , what type of gadget gets this can to open ? i had to use an old fashioned beer can opener which left me with the problem of fishing out the little truffles through a jagged opening . when i finally succeeded , chopped the truffles , and put my nose close to them , there was hardly any aroma . after adding them to the risotto i was making , there still was not much truffle perfume . this is a better quality truffle than the previous brand i'd bought . you actually could get that almost garlic like undertone to the truffle . i've pretty much decided that for a home cook , truffle infused oil of good quality is the way to go . you don't get the full spectrum of the truffle aroma , but what's there is quite intense . 
=================
ok , but not as good as other brands i've used the smoky flavor is not as pronounced in this as in other brands i've used . inexpensive , but i think i'll put out the extra for one of the others next time .

a high quality , gmo & bpa free tomato product ! taste & quality before corporate productivity ! pomi produces some of the highest quality packaged tomato products with the added bonus of being gmo and bpa free . and it's not just the fact that they are packed in tetra - pack that makes them bpa free , it's also because they are not stored / transported in any bpa lined containers before final packaging . as far as gmo's , it looks like we are going to have to source produce from european countries that require gmo ingredient labeling until the usa catches up .

healthful , not too sweet hot cereal this cereal has great texture ( not over - processed ) and the portion size is generous . it also is not overly sweetened and has great flavor from the fruit . i became aware of this product through my workplace cafeteria . unfortunately , when i ordered the peach raspberry oatmeal online , i was sent onion soup instead . food items are not returnable , so i am stuck with something that i did not order .

leaking bottle one of the 6 one liter bottles was damaged at the seam and leaking ( not sealed ) therefore not safe to consume . also these bottles are somewhat short - dated compared to what you can buy in the store right now . the store expiration dates tend to be around mid - 2012 whereas these bottles expire jan 2012 .

tastes just like raisin bran cereal ! ! ! after reading the reviews , i was expecting this cereal to tastes like great muesli and was i wrong . it's just like raisin bran . . . . where's all of the fruit and yummy taste ? i should've been more careful before ordering this . now i have a whole caseload of this stuff . well , at least it's edible and not terrible for cereal , but it's not great for muesli for sure . 
=================
rough stuff i didn't have such luck with this product as the other reviewers - - unfortunately i got severe abdominal cramps the few times i tried it . still , it's worth a try because it works for many people . just bear in mind that if you get some bad cramping , you are probably sensitive to senna , the active ingredient in the tea . so stay away from other senna products , too . ( usually labeled " stimulant laxative . " ) so what works for me ? lots of the high - fiber foods every day . plenty of raw fruits ( except banana ) and vegetables ( two raw carrots a day works wonders ! ) whole grains every day makes a big difference - - i especially like brown rice and oatmeal . apples are yummy : i eat one every day . eating beans and legumes is also very helpful . buy some dried lentils - - they cook the fastest - - and google some soup recipes . and keep products made with white flour to a minimum . in the worst case scenario , try plain old water . both ways . nature is great .

one happy buddy boy . . . . . . . . . . our mix - breed rescue dog had obviously been through a lot . 3 years of repeated & chronic ear infections ( per the few records we were able to find ) & itchy , red inflammed ( no fleas ) skin . his poor teeth are ground down to the nub , with two of the incisors broken off halfway . we were glad he has found a forever home with us ! after we paid for two expensive vet visits , two rounds of prescription antibiotics and ear drops , i knew we had to find a permanent solution , or buddy might not get to stay with us . i read online that many pet foods ( including science diet and other " higher grade " type of pet food ) have large amounts of corn , meal , or other grains as the primary ingredient . . . . . . . . often causing some of the symptoms poor buddy was having . one of the brands that was highly recommended instead was the halo brand . he tried it , and within 3 days , buddy's skin had become a normal color , and he was no longer biting his red , itchy belly or elsewhere . he was finishing up the second round of antibiotics & ear drops , so we wondered if it was the food or the consistent care ? there are chunks of vegetables ( i've seen potato , carrots , green beans . . . . . . ) in the canned food . i haven't seen any stems , but if i were dissatisfied with any of the foods , i would return them to the place i bought them for a refund . i took back a couple bags of food that were half used ( after our rescue cats were deemed to have urinary crystals & needed prescription diets ) and petco gladly refunded me the full amount . it's been over a year now , and sweet buddy has had no ear infections . we love halo pet food , and for us - it has been well worth the price . two expensive vet visits would pay for a year's worth of this food ! now - if only both my rescue cats health issues could be so easily ( and cheaply ) solved ! ( halo doesn't make a food that would help them ) .

blue was not blue . yellow and red were great . the blue turned out to be a faded shade of red - purple coming straight out of the bottle . the yellow was decent , but it's just turmeric , which is easier to do with dried turmeric alone . the red was quite brilliant . i contacted the company via email to give them my comments on the blue and unfortunately didn't receive a response .

fair aroma and flavor . not particularly fresh . i usually only buy freshly roasted beans from various online stores , but bought these on a whim while ordering some other stuff from amazon . when i received the beans , i was immediately disappointed with the bag which did not appear to be vacuum sealed very tightly . the date on the bag indicated something to the effect of " sell by 6 / 23 / 2013 " which tells me that these beans were probably roasted in june of 2012 ; it's now september , which means these beans have been sitting in the bag for 2 + months with a less - than - ideal seal . not good ! when i opened the bag and took a " whiff " , the beans smelled okay but definitely didn't have that rich chocolaty aroma that i'm used to with freshly roasted beans . the beans all have an even dark appearance with a mild oil sheen ; no burned charcoal in this bag , which is good ! i had my first cup this morning and was less than thrilled with the brewing aroma ; it again lacked the richness that i'm used to with my other blends . the flavor can be described in the same way ; it's not bad at all , but not particularly outstanding . compared to the " established " household name brand beans that you can pick up in any grocery store , cameron's organic french roast is a definite step up in flavor but it just can't compete with the roasted - to - order boutique blends . if you can manage to get these beans freshly roasted and in a tight vacuum sealed bag ( where so much air has been sucked out that the beans all leave impressions in the side of the bag ) , this may very well be an excellent coffee . as it was shipped to me . . . it's only fair . edit ( 06 - sep - 2012 ) : spelling corrections . i must have been half asleep when i typed this ! need . . . more . . . coffee . . . ! ! it's worth noting that i ground up the entire bag and brought it to my workplace for my coworkers to use in the office coffee maker ; they are accustomed to drinking long oxidized grocery - store purchased name - brand coffee ( which i refer to as " butt - blend " ) . cameron's is a real treat for their defiled palates !

many ingredients to be called a clear broth soup i was looking for a nice clear broth soup for lunch coming off of the master cleanse . i found these packets in my pantry at home . there are quite a few ingredients to be called a clear broth soup ! why add wheat and wheat gluten ? ? ? and monosodium glutamate ? now i have to look up succinic acid , sodium citrate , disodium inosinate , and disodium guanylate . looks like alot of sugar and salt . you can do better than this kikkoman . hmmm . guess i will wait until i get home to have my home made veggie broth soup .

the truvia made our whole family ill the flavor and quality cannot compare to zevia ginger ale made with erythritol and stevia but not into a mega commercial commodity . i don't know all of what they must do to " process " truvia into what it is since they don't have to disclose the process or the additives , but no comparison to just good erythritol and stevia . wouldn't have thought it would make such a difference . we will never buy any of these sodas again . all of the zevia sodas are good ( although more expensive , they are worth it ) and don't make everyone have serious intestinal pain .

wellness canned dog food for adult dogs , 95 - percent lamb , 12 - pack of 13 . 2 - ounce cans i like the fact that wellness offers grain free all meat canned and limited ingredient allergy dry food . unfortunately my old dog has serious skin issues that wellness also did not seem to correct so i have decided to take him off commercial foods completely and he now eats only organic human grade freeze dried artisan dog food . wellness dog food is probably one of the better choices if you feed your dog commercial foods so i recommend this product over other cheaper commercial brand names . amazon prices are the best and shipping to maui excellent .

misrepresentation and blaming others . what a surprise when i only received 3 bars total ! the seller blamed it on amazon putting in the wrong information . the ad was marked as sold out for a few days . yesterday i was checking and the same ad was back on . when i contacted the seller they again blamed amazon . they were again offering a pack of 12 for $ [ . . . ] . today they have changed it to a pack of 12 for $ [ . . . ] . i will be keeping a close eye on them and hope you do too ! an honest seller would have checked their listing and honored their ad . they are saying that amazon confused thier listing with other sellers of this same product . they are the only ones selling lindt excellence dark chocolate 70 - percent cocoa bars , 3 . 5 - ounce bars ( park of 12 ) . how could amazon have gotten this confused ! the seller should always check their listing .

mediocre wine it's good wine . everything worked out okay . i'm not impressed . but i'm not depressed . i bought the shiraz , also . little watery - lack of flavor , but it's cheap so i'll go with it . i'd advise anyone to buy this if they like cheap wine that's fun to make .

a little smaller than i thought they'd be i bought these as an alternative to other oral hygiene products based on price - probably not a great decision . the chips are a lot smaller than standard rawhide chips you might buy in a regular pet store or supermarket , and my dog ( 25 lbs . ) doesn't seem to love them . might be size - appropriate for dogs & lt ; 15 lbs . 
=================
good , but far too sweet ! ! i use this to calm my generally overactive system , deal with stress and sleep better , and it's not unpleasant . it's sweetened with stevia , which i prefer to any other sweetener . one star off : it's horribly sweet ! ! most american - made sweet goods are sweet to such a degree that sometimes it's hard to detect any other taste , but even by those standards this stuff is incredibly oversweetened . i'll use it , but i wish there were another , less sweet and more natural flavor available . how about , say , mango or grape . . . ?

not for your average dog don't buy this " toy " unless your dog is a genius . i have two smart dogs but this toy doesn't interest them a bit unless i am making it dispense goodies . waste of money in my estimation .

beware over - priced ! ! ! this is the best oat bran cereal . but one star because it is over - priced ! should be less than $ 3 . 00 a box , if purchased from your local grocery store , such as harris teeter or publix . or order directly from hodgson mill website for a case with 6 boxes for a total of $ 11 . 50 , though shipping costs are high . or order from iherb website at $ 2 . 07 a box , lower shipping charges . still this is the best oat bran cereal in the market . 
=================
dried cherries i wish i was more positive , but i am not really happy with the product . i have bought traverse bay cherries in the past . these cherries have an off taste as if they have been in storage too long and are far too over plump as to suggest extra sugar has been added to increase weight . michigan cherries from traverse bay has been an excellent product in the past . i suspect these are second rate in some fashion .

toxic waste are the same as warheads toxic waste vs warheads ? they taste almost exactly the same except toxic waste has a sour core to it . lemon is the most sour flavor . for [ . . . ] you get 12 containers with 16 pieces in each . 12x16 = 196 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! . get toxic waste mainly because you get more than warheads and there is that sour core . the core however is no where near as sour as the coating on the outside .

must have for gf baked goods ! yes , shipping is ridiculous - but if you want to make the cakes , cookies , lemon bars to die for , etc . , from gluten free baking classics , you have to have this flour . there is no substitute . i make the lemon bars all the time - they are constantly requested by my non gf family . you don't need this flour if you make the breads from gfbc , only the sweets , but who wants to go through life without the sweets ? there is little difference between buying it from amazon and buying it directly from authentic foods - i think authentic foods direct was a few pennies cheaper . suck it up , count the shipping as part of the cost of the flour , swallow hard , and never look back . . . 
=================
everyone has their taste but for sumatra everyone has their own pallet and their opinion on what is too bitter , roast flavor , too strong etc . for the sumatra bean and their roasting , this is a good flavor and balance . i still think that some roast too hot / long and kill some flavor while others seem to add its own taste by the roasting process . i am no coffee afficiando but i do know what i do and don't like and this is a re - buy once i finish .

it made me eat my broccoli i'm not a broccoli fan , and yet i liked this - - which probably says something about the amount of broccoli in it ! my daughter loves both broccoli and mac 'n' cheese , which is why i got this - - turned out she only kinda liked it , whereas i thought it was great . i added the suggested crumbled ritz crackers to the top and followed the directions , and thought the meal was very tasty . it's really just a sprinkling of broccoli for a bit of flavor , definitely not a full serving . you'd still need to add a vegetable to this meal . 
=================
for a water flavorant , great . definitely not a cocktail . breaking away from my sweet tea habit was a bit of a struggle for me , and water flavoring packets like crystal light have made it much easier . i'm generally a fan of lemonade and berry flavors , but mojitos are my favorite cocktail so i decided to give these a try . i generally use part of a packet - - about 1 / 3 - - to flavor a large , 32 ounce water bottle . any less and it just tastes like slightly acidic water ( not bad , but not great ) and more tastes way to sweet . it's got a nice distinctive minty lime flavor , you can definitely tell that it's meant to be mojito flavored ! on the whole , it's very good and i'd definitely get it again as a water additive . on the other hand , it does have a bit of an aftertaste and doesn't quench thirst quite as well as plain old water . i also wouldn't use this for a cocktail base ( with water added - - i can't speak to just dumping the powder into rum ) . it just tastes really watered down ( unsurprisingly ) and certainly isn't a good substitute for actual mint , lime , and soda , unless you really like to punish yourself by imagining how good an actual cocktail is while suffering through a nasty tasting " diet " substitute . if you want a real mojito just save your calories and get one on the weekend , don't try to use this stuff !

price now too expensive this is a great product but unfortunately the price has continued to rise . it is now cheaper for me to buy this product at walmart ( $ 13 . 63 including tax ) for a package of 24 instead of paying the $ 14 . 44 ( subscribe & save ) . when i add my $ 1 coupon the price was $ 12 . 63 . the price of this product on amazon used to be $ 11 . 12 less than 6 months ago . since then it has continued to increase and has gone up by 29 . 86 % . i rated this product a 2 / 5 due to the high price and the unreasonable increase in price over the past 6 months . i will buy again if the price goes down to that of walmart . - jon -

these are good . . but not $ 38 good ! these were $ 24 a few months ago . . . now they want to price gouge us for $ 15 more ! ill pass . i hope these rot on the shelves : i mean that in the nicest way possible .

define southern this is not what i would call southern sweet tea . i was raised on sweet tea and this is simply iced tea . if you are looking for something that is as sweet and sugar laden as your grandmother's tea , this is not it . it is great iced tea , put some sugar in the bottom of the cup before you brew it and it can make delicious sweet tea as well . it is a great alternative to making an entire pitcher when no one else will drink it . 
=================
why buy anthing else these are the only pig ears i'd buy for my dog . just like the cadet's i used to buy in the bags . pig ears ( 25 piece ) . no skimping out . all pig ears come in one large box and were quite large in size . for the price and quality of the product i wouldn't buy anything else .

good but too thin earth best doesn't put much solid contents into their baby food . too thin for a sitter !

they melted = ( i sent my mother these thinking it was such a great deal . why don't they put something in the box to keep them semi - cool . dry ice ? oh well supposedly they are refunding me which is good but i just wish she got all those chocolates for mothers day . that's the thing about buying foods or snacks on amazon other than that i'll still use the site . 
=================
good but not great ok but not the rich tomato flavor i expect from italian variety . a reader commented on my review and pointed out that carmelina does not add much by way of chemicals to enhance the flavor . he / she nailed me , i guess . and a little bit of salt brings these 'maters up to snuff . my own chemicals being better for me than theirs .

i'd travel to vegas for a douwe egbert's in fact before ordering it online through amazon the only time i could find this coffee was served at the fitz on freemont , the plaza at the end of freemont or the now closed sahara on my trips to vegas . how good is the coffee ? the one place in hawaii that sold douwe egberts was a commercial beverage place and the frozen concentrate that goes into a commercial coffee dispenser like the ones the casino uses would have cost me $ 240 . . . and i was gonna buy it until i notice it was kona blend istead of filter blend ( kona has that " coffee ash " after taste starbuck's is so fond of sticking in all their blends as a " flavor " . . blech ) luckily i found filter blend here and been ordering it ever sincee

wretched i love good black licorice . i love salted dark chocolate caramels . i thought salted black licorice , what a great idea . it might be the rankest candy i have ever tasted . it must be what putting formaldahyde in your mouth would taste like . then i had to throw it away as you cannot return food items via amazon . you should have smaller sample packs for first time users !

love love love these ! ( edited because no longer available in prime ) perfect . . . just a little something sweet to keep you going . . . no aftertaste of any kind . ( because of the reviews , just ordered the berry and orange . . . can't wait to try those , too . ) great tasting sugar free candy is not always easy to find . . . this one hits a home run . and as a bonus , the box is adorable . . easy to pop in your purse . : ) * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * no longer available in prime so that takes care of that item . nice going amazon or whomever is responsible . let me know when the shipping is not off the charts .

still have moles . . . . i tried several tricks to rid myself of my moles . i tried flooding them and using flares in their hole . . all with no success . i bought this trap last spring . it's now fall and i still have moles . as a matter of fact , it hasn't caught one mole yet ! ! i just got a couple kittens that i'm hoping will help me with the mole problem in the spring . i think my next trick will be to try those poisen worms or some people have suggested using wrigley chewing gum . . . . if none of those things work i may have to resort to dynamite ! ! if i do try another trap , it'll be one of those in - line traps . . . .

great food ! we have two five - month - old kittens that we brought home when they were 12 weeks old . we had no trouble transitioning them from their shelter food to blue buffalo . our boys love blue buffalo , and it is made of ingredients that i for the most part would be willing to eat . it is about the same price range as some of the fancier brands , but take a look at the ingredient list sometime - there is no " [ animal ] byproduct meal " in this food - ew ! look at most other brands' ingredient list for comparison - scary stuff ! the 7 - lb bag lasts us a month - my understanding is that since there's less filler , they actually don't need to eat as much food to get what they need . our kittens have grown like weeds and are full of energy . they have amazingly shiny coats even though they are only 5 months old . they don't shed as much as i would have expected ( granted , this could be partially because of age ) . one of our kittens does get some smelly farts occasionally , but they , um , don't linger , so we don't mind and neither does he . we supplement with a can of wet a day - blue canned food is just waaaay too expensive ( $ 1 . 40 for a small can ! ) , so we use authority ( sold by petsmart ) which has decent ingredients and you can get a big can for $ . 70 when it's on sale .

waxy , too thick , gas - causing it's challenging to create a chocolate bar with erythritol or xylitol without compromising texture and flavor ( " cooling " effect ) . but it is doable ! i've ordered chocolates sweetened with xylitol or erythritol from 3 other manufacturers , and i was pleasantly surprised that they weren't waxy . this one , unfortunately , is so waxy that it doesn't taste like chocolate at all . some people liken these bars to easter bunnies , but don't the bunnies have a better mouthfeel ? perhaps it's due to the fact that the bunnies are thin ( hollow ) , and therefore kind of elegant . this bar is a very thick solid block - difficult to bite . what made it even worse in my case - i happened to try the almond variety , and they contained intact almonds ! other manufacturers break almonds into small pieces , and that's what creates an elegant experience . eating this one felt like alternating between putting a plain almond and a piece of sweetened wax in the mouth . finally , they contain oligofructose ( fos ) , which causes gas in sensitive people . some may get bloated from eating just 1 / 3 of this bar . the alternatives that i mentioned above are : - the best one by far was a custom order from a small maker . e - mail cocosrawchocolates at yahoo , and she will make it the way you want . fantastic ! ! ! - lucienne's - i haven't tried their improved version yet . the previous version , while flavorful and with decent texture , was too acidic to my taste ( i usually eat 90 % - cocoa bars , but only non - acidic ) ; - healthy chocolate ( their product is sold under several labels , e . g . " xyla " ) - although it wasn't waxy , it still lacked the right texture and flavor , was very boring ( opinion shared by relatives and friends ) ;

v8 cherry pomegranate beverage the v8 brand caught my eye and raised my expectations ; they have a reputation for quality products . so even without detailed pictures of both the front and back labels or the having ingredients listed on this product's description , i purchased this item . when it arrived i was very disappointed because this product contains only 10 % juice ! this " flavored beverage " is a juice drink in my estimation and an expensive one at that . the first two ingredients are : water , high fructose corn syrup . . . i'm so confused about what actually is considered : juice , juice cocktail , juice drink , flavored water and / or how much juice is really in each of them . the consumer is at the short end of this confusion and this deal in particular .

toblerone weight details there are no details about the weight of the toblerone products offered on line . . . . . . . . 24 count means nothing what is the net weight per bar . it is suggested that both the single bar weight and total weight per box of 24 should be specified to make clear what one is buying also for the 60 count mini toblerone , it does not show the total weight of the 60 count mini toblerone box . please clarify & display these details on your web site to facilitate a buying decision . thanks

good price , decent coffee but not much hazalnut flavor this coffee smells terrific as it brews . the flavor is nice but is missing any distinctive hazalnut flavor . if it's the taste your after , order something different . if it's the scent you like but are not a big hazelnut fan , this might be your brew . 
=================
great product but beware of poor packaging . the product is amazing . it's the consistency of creamy peanut butter , but it tastes like cookies . other reviewers rave about it , and i agree with them . it basically tastes heavenly on anything or even by itself . the bad - the seller packaged both jars together with no protection between them , which caused one of the jars to break . fortunately , the other jar is fine , but essentially , i got one jar for the price of two . i could get a refund if i return everything , but i don't want to return the undamaged jar , because the product is so good . 
=================
ginger beer ? not i like ginger beer - but was disappointed in this ginger ale . it is not ginger beer and is especially not fiery . then most absurd of all it has aspartame - and is not listed as a diet drink . false information on this product . i did contact seller - with no response

awesome on the grill - need to order more now , or a recipe ! i was given omaha steaks marinated salmon fillets # 1417 4pcs / 6oz as a gift . i grilled these indirectly over high heat for just over 4 minutes per side exactly and was totally blown away by just how good they were . i was not a salmon fan at all and never ordered salmon when dining out . i now may have to alter that theory when we go out for fine dining to try to compare those events against this item . awesome on the grill ! moist and very flavorful . i would please ask someone to please invent or advise a copy - cat recipe that attempts to mimic this product since it could get pricey to buy these often otherwise ! but oh so good in my opinion ! hope you agree . here is the ingredient deck : atlantic salmon , marinade ( canola oil , olive oil , water , salt , spices , dehydrated garlic , paprika , dehydrated onion , dehydrated red bell pepper , autolyzed yeast extract , natural grill flavor , natural smoke flavor , citric acid , and natural flavor ) , color added . i posted a picture showing the nutrition facts and recommended preparation methods too . take care .

dog loves it but nutrition value is a bust my dog loves it , it may be the soft texture but after giving it to her this week , she has had stomach issues so i checked the label , too much junk , no substance ; i should have done that first , i switched her to orijen which is a dry , good content , and she loves it ; voted best dog food in 2010 and 2011 . 
=================
i agree , stinky and skinny ! ! ! my mini schnauzer loves the ( expensive ) bully sticks we buy at the store , so i decided to try these . they are skinnier and she goes through them much faster . they also stink and make her breath stink ! ! we still have a lot left , not sure what i am going to do .

uncleat quantity we have used the product for years but can no longer get it locally . the problem was with the description which says it comes as 8 count , 1 . 13 oz box . apparently what this means is a box ontains 8 packets which is true . however , the way it is worded i expected to receive 24 boxes as i had ordered quantity of three . 3x8 = 24 . i received only three boxes at a cost of $ 26 . 97 which means ipaid $ 8 . 99 for one box of 8 packets . one box of 8 packets can be purchased anywhere including amazon for between $ 2 . 00 and $ 3 . 00 . this order is being returned for refund . if the price is actually $ 8 . 99 for one box , the description should read " price $ 8 . 99 , quantity , one box of 8 packets . of course if it actually said that , they would never sell any at all . it is my opinion that the correct price is 8 boxes of 8 packets each for $ 8 . 99 . that makes a lot more sense but that is just my opinion . 
=================
very finely ground . strong blueberry color and strong taste like all other products from bob's red mill that i have tried , the quality of this flour is excellent . very finely ground , no lumps at all , very fresh and always come in perfect packaging . the color of it seems almost white when the flour is raw but as you cook it , for some reason it becomes a whole lot darker . even a tiny bit of it gives to any dish a strong blueberry - like color . that can sometimes look a bit unattractive if you are cooking for others . i made for instance a broccoli soup with broccoli , potatoes , chicken broth and i used this flour to thicken it . i only added a very tiny bit of flour , for a big pot of soup , but the whole thing turned dark purple . now i guess a dark purple soup does not exactly match what most people would expect a broccoli - potato soup to look like lol . but fortunately i just cooked it for myself and i'm not really picky about how the food looks . it also holds a very strong , somewhat bitter taste . a little bit of this flour will not only be very visible in any dish but also you will be able to clearly taste the black beans . i was using bob's red mill garbanzo flour before this , and that one , instead , had a very mild flavor and a very pale color . personally , i will not buy this flour again because the color and especially the flavor are a bit too much for me ( i will probably go back to the garbanzo flour or the white beans flour ) , but i still give 5 stars because i think it is the best you can realistically expect from a black bean flour .

oyster sauce my wife says it has a bitter aftertaste , but i don't mind the taste . because it is organic , i prefer it to lee kum kee oyster sauce .

white chocolate mousse calorie control the testure is very light and that is good . the taste is very strong of artificial sweetner . this might be ok served over a dish of fresh berries . but alone the taste is lacking . i will not buy this flavor again . however , many of the other ediet desserts are most excellent . i highly recommend the other mousse desserts & flavors . 
=================
good stuff but way too expensive ! the product itself deserves 5 stars as all 3 of my cats go crazy and sometimes even fight for it . however , kitty kaviar or " bonito flakes " as the japanese call them are used in actual cooking and if you look it up under this name on amazon , there are sellers who are selling it for a fraction of the price listed here . you can also find this at your local korean / japanese grocer in big bags that last months . 
=================
shipping is what brought this down to 2 stars i was charged just as much for shipping as what the product cost ! over $ 12 for this small box of coconut creme powder ! i love the product , it tastes rich and wonderful , but i'll find it elsewhere for less than that . . . 
=================
do not buy ! i am pretty upset about the recent pricing change on this product . i have been buying this for years and have had this on s & s for sometime . my s & s was recently cancelled by amazon at the same time it was suppose to ship ( hence i ran out of olive oil ) . i went on to re - order the product and thought at the time it was cancelled due to amazon frustration free packaging ( yes i should have paid closer attention to the ounces when re - bought ) however to my dismay when opening the package today the tins were half the size than the old ones . so basically i am thinking ok - i wont be buying this brand again , i'll have to find a new one . now i am even more upset as i just came on here to write a review and when i search zoe olive oil - the 1 liter tins came up - but are no longer on s & s zoe extra virgin olive oil , 1 liter tins ( pack of 2 ) and they are 50 cents more than the 25 . 5 ounce 2 pack on s & s . these are basically a rip off now . i hate to leave a negative product review about something that i like , but this one bothered me so much i felt completed to inform other consumers about the recent changes . 
=================
don't get if you have a sensitive nose ! i love licorice , and figured these would be good . they are - - the texture is right , the saltiness and sweetness were right on . however , when you eat these , you get a very strong ammonia smell in your nose , due to the ammonium chloride . i wish they would salt them with something else , because this smell is a bit overwhelming , and makes the product a little unpleasant . it makes me wonder , too , how healthy it is to be consuming something that has an obvious amount of ammonia in it . . . if ammonia doesn't bother you , then i would recommend these on initial flavor and texture . 
=================
hard to get into toy ! these are so hard to get into the toy ! i have had to resort to using a screwdriver to actually get it in . the medium size is also difficult , but nowhere near as hard as the large size . i was really excited about these when i bought the toy , but it is so hard to get in that now i only use it when i know i will be gone for a significant amount of time . the first time i gave it to my dog , he had it out in about 2 minutes . thankfully the next time it took a couple of days , but it is annoying to get these in . 
=================
my cats who will eat anything will not touch these ! i have 3 cats and they are little piggies and none of them would touch these . . . wouldn't even try them . one of my cats will eat just about anything you offer him and he wouldn't even try them . they gobble up the liv - a - littles dehydrated chicken so i thought i'd try these . looks like raccoons are getting these ! i do not recommend ! ! 
=================
not very good i'm a vegetarian , i enjoy sprouted grain breads and meat alternatives , but as far as desserts go , i still find very few vegan / gluten free ones i like the taste of . this one was not very good . i still prefer to bake with butter , eggs and ( wheat ) flour . 
=================
above and beyond any reasonable expectation . i live in an urban coach house where the rear faces the alley . the alley is filled with trash , so as one might expect , i get my fair share of rogue flies in my house . i first tried the sticky fly tape stuff inside , and while it worked decently , it was more of a situation where it would catch a fly if it just happened to land on the strip . i still found myself killing more of them via shoe than the tape managed to catch . not to mention having fly tape in your house is disgusting and messy . so i decided to try the victor fly magnet outside by the garbage . if this thing caught 30 flies i would be satisfied . it caught , seriously , thousands . they are literally jam packed in it all the way to the top , and more are still trying to muscle their way in . i'm not only amazed by how well this trap works , i'm amazed that this many flies live near my home . my only question is , what do i do with it now ? set it on fire ? tape a grenade to it ? in the 4 days since i put it outside , i have not had one fly in my house . not a single one . oh , and it doesn't stink that bad . the bait , when your mixing it in , smells like a barn or perhaps a dead fish . i can barely smell it when i'm standing next to the trap full of flies in the hot summer air . 
=================
good kick , but funky flavor these have a good kick , come in nice packaging , and have an initially good flavor , but they have a sour aftertaste that leaves a nasty flavor in your mouth that lingers . not exactly what i think of when i think of cherry jelly bellies . however , they do give you a quick shot of energy . 
=================
6 month old puppy did not really go for this i have a 6 month old pomeranian puppy who loves chewing . i introduced this product to him , along with a compressed rawhide stick , and a himalayan dog chew ( himalayan dogs chew 3 to 5 - pieces for dogs up to 20 - pound , 3 - 1 / 2 - ounce ) at the same time . he jumped on the compressed rawhide and did not stop until he'd eaten it all about a week later . he looooooved this thing - it must have tasted super good ! he then tried the antler for maybe a day . . . it had an interesting smell coming from the part that was cut , and so he chewed on this for a little bit and got some of the hard interior out , but that was it . he's loving the himalayan dog chew though and now carries it everywhere . . . it's very hard but can be bitten through and eaten if he works at it long enough , and he seems to like the flavor of it . he's totally forgotten about the antler . it's just sitting on the floor now . it's just too hard for him . i tried at least - i want him to have more natural treats and chew toys ! like another reviewer said earlier , it definitely depends on your dog and you won't know until you've bought the product and tried it out . 
=================
good taste but too high in sodium i ate this brand for years until i was put on a sodium restricted diet . there's no reason that i can see to add salt to oatmeal . until nature's path at least lowers the sodium i'll be buying instant oatmeal with no salt added - yes it's available . 
=================
carmel macchiato the carmel macchiato is a bit to sweet for me . if you like sweet , that's the one for you to buy . i keep it on hand for my friends when they visit
=================
better as a dipping sauce , still not that good this sauce has a very spicy kick to it in heat and a little more tanginess than i prefer . it isn't bad but am not sure it works that great with tacos . i think it better as a dipping sauce for fried foods or veggies . even that is a bit of a stretch . i wouldn't be a buyer .

red sea salt used it in a recipe for pulled - pork . had never heard of it before and couldn't find it locally . ordered it and himalayan sea salt from fairies finest . i'd procrastinated and was afraid it wouldn't arrive in time , so i called and they promised to get it in the mail right away . showed up in 3 days . the salt has undertones of clay , which gives it a deeper flavor and was used as a rub it the recipe . the liquid smoke overpowered it , but the flavor was there . i think it best used as a rub or finishing salt . there is also black hawaiian salt . . . somehow mixed in with lava ! have to try that next . . . p . s . the salt was well packaged in a jar . 
=================
great product - - outrageous price ! this premium tonic is definitely worth getting , but not at this price . fentimans and q - tonic also good , but fever tree is my favorite . . . . more bubbly and citrusy . wegmans sells it for $ 6 / four pack .

too sweet i have tried several varieties of the k - cups now , coffees , teas , and hot chocolate and i have enjoyed several , but these i found to be much too sweet . i love the caribou blend k - cup single - serving coffee 108 ct . and green mountain - keurig - nantucket blend - k - cup - box of 24 kcups for the coffees . for the teas i enjoy twinings keurig k - cups african rooiobos tea for keurig brewers , 25 - count k - cups ( pack of 2 ) and celestial seasonings k - cups india spice chai , 8 . 8 - ounce boxes ( pack of 2 ) as well as the any of the english breakfast teas .

expiration date ? actually i'd like to buy this dry milk powder . but i saw one past review saying that the expiration date of this product is sep . 2012 which means it only has 5 months left . i left this review , because i'd like to ask the owner when is the expiration date for the product we will receive if we order now . thanks . 
=================
decent islay blend a somewhat decent blended of peaty islay malts . the rumor is that it used to contain mostly lagavulin , but i don't know if there is any truth to that . the fact is , the bottler probably buys casks of whatever islay distiller has over - produced . the result is that the flavors change from bottle to bottle . not bad , just different . a cheaper way to sample the flavors of islay . 
=================
very , very sweet i tried this creamer because i like caramel flavored coffee and i like creamer . whether you will like it or not is a matter of personal preferences . i couldn't detect any caramel taste to it . one sip was enough for me due the overwhelming sweetness . it tasted like someone had dropped a few dozen tablespoons of sugar in my coffee . if you like extremely sweet coffee and don't care about caramel flavor , you might like this product . if you mainly want caramel flavor , you would be better off with a caramel syrup or flavored coffee beans .

magical ? senna tea is truly magical in the way it temporarily replaces your internal organs with bees . i guess i must not be worthy enough in the constipation department to truly reap the benefits of senna , and so the gods of this truly magical herb treated me instead to merciless abdominal pain and rear - ended agony . does it make you poop ? yes , you will poop everything that is inside you , including your innards .

price is $ 7 . 95 the price for just one package ? seriously ? can someone tell me if you receive more than one package ? the price i paid for one when living in hawaii ( only 4 months ago ) was only $ 1 . 69 . how can it cost 4 times more here ? i love this dressing and was my favorite so hope i am wrong about what i see for the price of one package ! original hawaiian papaya seed dressing mix

try gloria jean's peppermint herbal tea instead in the larger world , my favorite mint tea is bigelow's plantation mint . unfortunately , that's not available in the keurig world . in trying to replicate plantation mint , i bought four sample packs of mint options directly from keurig for testing . gloria jean's version is the best of the mints by far . my problem with timothy's ? it has a strong twang up front and a noticeable unpleasant chemical aftertaste that tastes a bit like chewing a mint leaf whole . even when cut with a lot of water as iced tea is , it still has a too - sharp quality . i hesitate to add this lest i make myself sound crazy , but it also feels like it's forming a film on my tongue and throat as i swallow . i've tried about a dozen keurig flavors as iced tea and none of the others make this " film . " so try it if you must , but take it from someone who's actually compared . . . there are better options for mint tea in the keurig world . to make iced tea easily in a keurig , you need a very strong glass that won't break when taken from boiling to freezing . ( crate & barrel's excellent large working glass is the strongest i've found that still looks good . ) in a 21 - ounce glass , put your sweetener in - - 1 . 75 teaspoons of splenda for me , 1 . 25 t for my husband - - then brew a medium cup of tea . add ice to almost fill the glass . the ice will melt easily and will end up to be 1 / 4 of the total volume . stir and drink . the quality of your ice matters since the melted part will become at least half the drink . if you'd like to try a flavored iced tea other than mint , my very favorite is gj's passion fruit . it's out of stock , so i can't link to it . until it's available here , try the close second - place tea : gloria jean's coffees , tea k - cup , mango - flavored black tea for keurig brewers , 24 - count boxes ( pack of 2 ) .

it's hard to do better than wellness wellness is among the best cat foods out there . it is grain - free and it has ingredients of high quality . there are no meat by - products . my only caveat is that wellness' products with fish are not so good . quite frankly , cats don't eat fish in the wild , so their digestive systems are not designed for consumption of fish . that being said , this is a fantastic specific product . the meat is fresh , and i know my cat loves it . i adopted my cat ( he is five ) , and within weeks his coat was softer , the colors more vivid and i began seeing markings and colors i never saw before . on another note , i can't help but take a dig at one of the worst , if not the worst , foods out there . . . science diet . take a read on the ingredients . in doing so , you will the natural , very high grade , pure ingredients of wellness contrasted with the low grade , artificial , even mysterious ingredients of science diet food . hill's chooses the name " science diet " to lend it credibility that it just doesn't have . finally , cats can't digest grains and soy . hill's food is riddled with that stuff . bottom line : stay with wellness ; stay away from science diet .

great service and prices , crapy product i think a better description of all non - traditional , gummy products as these are needed to eliminate confusion . these gummys , as the other single fruit line are covered in crystalised sugar , and are more of a sweet candy . traditional gummbybears are asoft in and out single source cansy , the one we had as kids , these are quite sweet and hard to enjoy .

negative purchased the raspberry fruit rolls 3 times . the last 2 times ( 5 months apart ) the raspberry rolls were hard as rocks and had a perfume taste to them . all the other flavors were great . 
=================
afraid not i really wanted to disagree with customer wallace about this , and decided to take the plunge anyway since it was only a wee over two dollars . the ingredients in the description are the same as on the package : ingredients : black tea , orange peel and flavor . it doesn't say natural flavor , so i assume not , but don't know . smelling the tea inside the packet gives a very pleasant odor of black tea with a touch of grapefruit . unfortunately , using a decent amount of the dried tea , the taste of the tea was like very weak black tea , very watery , and you really had to spend time trying to sense any grapefruit despite the actual grapefruit peel in it . wait - it says orange peel , not pink grapefruit . sheesh . i just noticed that . but it doen't give you a sense of orange either . i was browsing amazon's tea because i had run out of a box of really great grapefruit tea ( bags ) made in poland and bought at my local dollar store , but the store no longer carries it . the brand name is babcia jagoda , with a smiling granny giving the ok sign . she's right . it has hibiscus , apple , rosehip , black currant , black chokeberry in it , but also lists " grapefruit aroma " and grapefruit juice , i assume dried . there is no black tea in it so i assume it's all herbal , but the thing is : it does have grapefruit aroma , but most importantly , it tastes grapefruity . i'm going to have to search online for a new source . 
=================
these are sour ! if you're a fan of sour candy , this is for you . these are coated with that sour sugar that makes your jaw get the " funny feeling " . they have a great apple flavor too . very soft licorice , not hard or hard to chew . they are pretty sticky though . 
=================
pricey this coffee is great but the deal is not . you can get these direct from keurig for about . 54 cents per cup . this " deal " equates to . 64 cent per cup . good coffee , bad deal . if your buying 160 of these at one time , the price should reflect it ! 
=================
not what i was expecting , but . . . i thought this would have more of an oatmeal consistency , but instead the grains remain somewhat separate and not particularly creamy . however , with dried fruit and a bit of agave , it makes a nice change from oatmeal . you just have to get past the consistency being different . 
=================
sprout master the biggest disadvantage to the sprout master is that i found it difficult to get rid of the hulls - it seems to be much easier with a jar and screens . however , the sprouts seem to store well in the sprout master - they stay fresh a long time .

i'll never drink generic tonic water again ! this stuff makes the junk you buy at the grocery store taste like it was squeezed from a gym sock . consider me a q - tonic convert . 
=================
excellent , but price is way off ! this is an excellent product , but for the same quantity it is $ 5 . 34 at costco . i use this for cleaning and getting rid of stubborn odors everywhere , and it just works . i seriously don't know why it is so overpriced from this merchant though . 
=================
potent stuff need energy ? this is it . red bull has nothing on this stuff . one word of warning , read the label . . . i'm not joking ! ! ! i can't stress this enough . i made the mistake of drinking a whole bottle at once . . . big mistake . anyone with a heart condition , or a nervous condition stay away . if you're healthy and need a boost . . . this is great stuff .

great product for frizzy hair . . . . ok , so i had no illusions that this product was somehow organic & chemical free considering that it's made by unilever ( owner of alberto culver , helene curtis , faberge' , etc . ) and costs less than 5 bucks . that being said , i had great results with this product . i used it as a " hot oil " treatment , and also to tame flyaways after shampooing ( a few drops will do for this purpose ) . there are no instructions about how to use the product , however . having worked in the beauty field , i didn't have an issue with this . it's a light oil ( yes , it's mineral oil . . . . that's what less expensive hair products like this are made of ) but there are also some fairly " nutritious " oils added in too . my wavy 'post hypothyroid' hair likes this product , even though i believe it's more intended for ethnic hair . if you have a dry , itchy scalp or dry , frizzy flyaway hair this product can help as long as it's used properly . think of it like the old fashioned vo5 ( brilliantine ) in a bottle , rather than trying to use it like a conditioner . i also use an argan oil hair product , and this product is very similar , yet at 1 / 4th the cost . the scent is " just right " a lightly fruity fragrance , which i prefer over flowery perfume - y scents most common in hair care products . if you can keep your expectations in alignment with reality , this product is . . . after all , less than $ 5 per bottle . . . i feel that you'll be satisfied . if not , you will be disappointed . if you need a totally organic product that does something similar , i'd opt for pure coconut oil instead ( with essential oil added for fragrance if need be ) . mineral oil can cause acne in individuals prone to it , so i'd keep this oil off your face ( especially around the hairline where blemishes can develop ) if that is the case . you can also wash your face after applying if you happen to spill . if your hair is parched ( oil dry ) , brittle , dull ( no shine ) , or heat damaged this product is for you . otherwise , i can see this oil as being too heavy for more normal hair types . 
=================
good taste , poor quality pods i really enjoy the flavor of this coffee ! the taste is subtle and not too strong . the only problem is that in almost every package there is at least one pod that is ripped or broken and all the coffee is in the bottom of the bag . . . very messy and of course , the pod is unusable . a little quality control would go a long way ! 
=================
yum ! but 18 . 25 ? i bought a bag of the blueberry version of this snack at costco recently ( well not just one bag . . i went back and got four ! ) they are really really good . not too sweet , gluten free , vegan and all natural ingredients . at costco they were $ 6 . 99 . i was googling it to see if i could find the other flavors listed on the back of the package - cranberry and pineapple mango - and this listing came up . $ 18 . 25 is the current price listed . i mean this product is good , but not that good . i wonder if the price listed is a typo . 
=================
delicious but laxative effect is explained . ok . . . the laxative effect is a secondary sweetener called maltitol . it is known to cause a laxative effect . its very similar to sugar so it can be used in the same manner . however it is known to cause irritation on the gi . maltitol is a very slow absorbing sugar and excess can cause gas , bloating and diarrhea . however , these jelly beans are delicious and taste very similar to the non - sugarfree variety . but , as the other reviewers cautioned self - discipline is going to be heavily recommended . these things are extremely powerful . on my first go i was warned by a friend who told me he had a bag and he almost died . i didn't believe him and i had a whole bag of these delicious beans . . . before i continue . . . go ahead and read the warnings on the bag . it suggests no more than 8 beans at a time . . . i tested this and it was best way to go and caused no problems . however , if you do consume a whole bag prepare for several hours of repeated bathroom visits , bloating like if your intestines were going to explode and and severe intestinal gas . so , go ahead enjoy a couple from time to time and it will be a very good purchase . but again , caution and self control ! 
=================
quality down i have been getting these on a monthly basis . in the last several shipments , the quality is not good . the goji is very wet and sticky , unlike the dried ones we had before . i have canceled the future shipments . 
=================
no coffee flavor / high calorie count i really wanted a decaf product so didn't have a lot of options . this powder essentially makes a chocolate flavored blended drink , even when i use cold decaf coffee or espresso as the " base " , the chocolate is what you taste . when i think of an iced coffee drink , i think of coffee with a hint of chocolate ( mocha ) not the other way around . as other reviewers point out , the 150 calories is for half the packet and no milk added . i will try a different brand next time . i'm still on the hunt for a mix that creates the same flavor i've experienced once in a great while at a coffee shop . or like the iced blended at a west coast chain ( cb & tl ) that is overpriced to have shipped ( and i think is available sugar free ) !

second order not so great these bars are great , this was my second order and the second box seems to be more stale . the first box contained bars that were so fresh and soft and this second box contains bars that are not as white , soft or fresh . they have a later expiration date but the products are not as fresh . 
=================
hardcore stuff i don't usually write reviews but i feel compelled to do so based on a misconception going around about this product . this is not another snake oil fix - it - all . it contains grounded corn with herbs , not processed sugar . yes it is full of carbohydrates and natural sugars , but it is not candy or a magical elixir . the tarahumara indians use it to fuel their ultra - runs , but that does not mean that you should gobble it up for a quick pick - me - up in the morning . you wouldn't eat running gels , protein shakes or michael phelps's lunch and then not do the work . if you want an alternative to gu or energy bars try this , if you are trying to get healthy by simply ingesting something ; don't .

earl grey tea pods for tassimo we received the pods within two weeks of ordering them , unlike the last time , when the order was cancelled by amazon after it wasn't filled in 60 days . places of business shouldn't advertise products for sale if they don't have it in stock .

good for a couple days my lab chewed up the rope in a couple hours . this alone is not a huge deal as the instructions with the toy say that a ball can be placed inside the container and have a similar effect as the rope . however , before i could even place a ball in it , the plastic developed a large crack from the dog just carrying his toy around the house and dropping it on our carpetted floors . he has other plasic toys that he has had for months with absolutely no signs of damage . 
=================
not worth the price i tried this once and expected something out of this world . it was good , don't get me wrong , but not for this outrageous price . there is a uniqueness in all coffees and this one has such a taste - subtly bitter , rich , a coffee that should be made by professionals , not the sipper with his $ 150 coffee pot . try the popoyan instead . 
=================
clumps : does not dissolve in liquids had high hopes for this product , but am very disappointed . the relative dietary pros and cons of the inulin fiber are a separate issue , but this product does not dissolve in liquids , as others have noted . but i need to add that it is not just in cold drinks , but any drink , including hot coffee and tea . i'll post pictures , but with coffee , you'll get huge solid clumps at the bottom of your cup , no matter how hot the water and no matter how aggressively you stir . with cold drinks , like ice tea and lemonade , i can see the clumps swishing around in my naglene bottle - - just like a snow globe as someone else wrote - - and all the vigorous shaking in the world does nothing to break them up . this causes you to use more of the product than you should and you're in for an awful , unpleasant surprise if you accidentally drink one of the clumps . this product may be ok to use on oatmeal or cereal , but not liquids . i am very happy with the sweetleaf tabs , however , which seem to dissolve well - - probably due to the lack of inulin fiber .

not what you might expect in terms of " quick cooking " at its weight , the huge bag of nishiki quick cooking brown rice ( 10 pounds ) isn't worth the hassle of returning . no way does this have a retail value of more than $ 60 , by the way , but i bought it for just over $ 20 , because i thought i could make brown and white seasoned rice blends whereby the rice would cook in the same amount of time . brown rice takes much longer to steam or cook up than long grain white rice , and my family isn't fond of the flavor of brown rice by itself . i can get regular brown rice for much less cost at the grocery store than this package from amazon , and when it arrived ( very quickly - 5 stars for delivery ) i read the package to discover the rice must be soaked for 20 minutes in water before cooking for an additional 25 minutes ! yikes ! nothing quick about a 45 minute process for rice . while i hadn't expected minute rice , i did expect a label stating " quick cooking " meant it actually cooks up quickly . for those who might not have cooked plain , brown rice , it steams or cooks up in the same 45 minutes or less that this " quick cooking " rice requires . i didn't even open the bag and will pass it on to someone who cooks brown rice on a regular basis . if you like brown rice and you don't have many local grocery stores , it might be worth buying from amazon , but don't expect this brand / type to save time in the kitchen .

the coming rabbit crisis i am shocked that amazon would conspire in rabbit slaughter and their consumption by the public . rabbits are cute and furry . they are the most popular pet in baluchistan and parts of vanuatu . many people have expressed their desire to marry rabbits , and the 9th circuit will soon affirm our constitutional right to realize that desire . many rabbits are wealthy and productive members of society . rabbits invented the steam engine , the toaster oven , the pneumatic bolt gun , and spandex . rabbits pay 27 % of all u . s . income taxes . this fall , for the first time , rabbits make up the majority of incoming freshman at miami university of ohio . since they received the right to vote in 1979 , rabbits have been reliable supporters of the whig party , which is the only thing standing between the world and utter chaos . last march , while the rest of us were cowering in basements and bomb shelters , rabbits were defending earth against the venusian invasion . of course the rabbits have begun to fight back against our heartless exploitation . roving bands of rogue rabbits have remained armed since their defeat of the venusians , and ` wilding' by rabbit gangs has made new york's central park unsafe at all hours of day and night . a radical whig splinter group , led by the mysterious rabbit who calls himself lucky lepus , has even been calling for armed revolt in pursuit of a separate , nuclear , rabbit republic . if we know what's good for us , we will put down the butcher's knife and make peaceful accommodation with the rabbits while it is still possible . amazon , for the love of god , stop selling this product before the rabbits come for us all .

scary stuff i read that you must make sure to wear your face mask while performing the simple operation of mixing this stuff . you don't want to be something that makes your blood clot abnormally . it is transglutaminase , an enzyme in powder form , derived from beef and pork blood plasma . europe has banned this . do you want to be eating it either ? frankenstein food . scary stuff . i see why more and more people are going vegan and not regretting it either .

no more diarrhea our 12 year old cat started losing her hair and then developed severe diarrhea and stopped using the litter box . after trying different foods , vet tests and an antibiotic , this food solved the diarrhea problem within a couple of days . it's now been 2 months and no more diarrhea issues . we are still watching to see if it helps with the hair loss .

screw the marketing . . . forget about the advertising and marketing , advertisements are all lies to make a quick buck anyway , in my my mind . i bought this out of pure curiosity because well . . . the advertisements worked and got me curious enough to try it . did it get me laid ? of course not , not even close . i do however really like the smell of it and that's enough for me ! if a girl doesn't like the way you smell , forget 'em , they weren't worth your time in the first place ! : - pthis a good scent for me and that's that ! : - d also check out axe " fever " , that's a good one too .

imagine apple butter jello i had low hopes , i have picked up walden farms from a local grocery store and for the most part be underwhelmed with their products because of the cellulose flavor . . . if you want a nice creamy apple butter that is almost like apple sauce , this is not it . you can tell in the jar that it is thick ; but the flavors are on point and no cellulose flavor . i started eating it with a spoon out of the jar . . . cause you know that is healthy . the one draw back is that it gives me gas , a common thing with sugar replacements . i will buy again for sure ! 
=================
call it luck ! it might have been luck or the fact that i ordered some other products as well , but i managed to get a box of these without any of them leaking . no sticky mess , just a few dented , which can be expected . box was inside a bigger box with a few other items and some air bags . great creamer without the sticky mess !

seemed like a good food but caused urinary crystals twice i fed this flavor to my cat for over two and a half years ( as a kitten he ate grain - free innova ) , almost exclusively wet food . if he got hungry later i'd give him a tiny sprinkle of wellness dry ( salmon ) , but twice a day he got this food . he developed urinary crystals twice even though the food says it's designed to prevent this problem . i was a big believer in healthy , grain - free , wet food , " natural " cat food diets . even when i was unemployed for a year , my cat continued to eat wellness while i ate instant noodles . it was fine , i thought i was feeding him the best and pre - emptively striking against any preventable health problems . well , he got urinary crystals on one occasion ; i brought him to the vet , $ 1 , 000 later and he seemed fine . the vet cautioned me against returning to the same diet but i somehow thought it would be okay and that the diet wasn't to blame . well , it was . a few months later he got the same problem . another $ 1 , 000 later and boarding for four days , my vet ( whom i've trusted with all my pets , dearly , for many years ) told me that ( 1 ) the " natural pet food craze " was overblown and ridiculous , that he's fed a leading brand of standard grocery store cat food and has had cats live beyond 19 years ; ( 2 ) the diet was the cause of my cat's troubles , and i had to change it . well , now he's on prescription food that's even more expensive than the fancy stuff but with seemingly far less high - quality ingredients . but he hasn't had the problem come back , and from what i can tell , he's got the same energy levels and healthy coat as before , just minus the urinary troubles . the stray cats my family and i feed ( six others ) all get the junky grocery stuff like friskies , fancy feast , and purina , and they have never needed to go to the hospital . i know diet isn't the only factor but it is certainly the major one . i would rather have my cat eating food that doesn't send him to the hospital with a life - threatening condition , than one that makes me feel good about its " naturalness . " mind you , urinary crystals are severely painful and will kill your cat if not treated within hours . this food might work for many owners but i'm not taking the risk again .

great milk choclate , hot cocoa i love chocolate everything and have purchased and used three brands of hot cocoa , from amazon , in our keurig k - cup brewer which was a 2011 christmas gift . the best milk chocolate flavor consumed was cafe escapes followed by grove square and totally unacceptable green mountain coffee , hot cocoa , which went to our local refuse hauler . i feel that you get what you pay for as cafe escapes was the highest cost and green mountain the cheapest and worst . i noticed that both cafe escapes and grove square were labeled milk chocolate flavor , hot cocoa , green mountain was not which may account for it's strange flavor . i wish there was a means of securing product samples rather than purchasing two boxes of some products like green mountain . 
=================
weirdest thing ever ! the miracle frooties were so weird . i was a little unsure about if they were going to work or not , but it turns out they really do ! it was expecting a lot more out of them , but i guess they will have to do . the only bad thing about them is when you eat lemons and limes your lips burn a lot and give your sores . other than that these things are amazing !

tastes like dargeeling not english breakfast . this is not really english breakfast tea . it is closer to a darjeeling tea , and seems to be all one tea not a blend . the yorkshire tea is closer to english breakfast than this one . in order to make this tea more useful , it is better to blend it with another tea such as ceylon tea , or one of the indian teas .

beefaroni mostly macaroni i'm recently widowed so have to learn to fix for a single person . i hoped this microwaveable bowl of " beefaroni " would provide a tasty lunch . to my surprise , i found that it was nearly all macaroni , with some tomato sauce and a very small amount of beef . the taste was ok if you like macaroni and a rather strong tomato sauce , but i expected more beef . also , as with so many canned food these days , be prepared for a high dose of sodium - - salt , that is - - 31 % of average daily requirement in one small serving . overall , no so good .

damaged goods i received these the other day and 2 cans were severely damaged , i had to throw them out , and 5 other cans came with minor dents . they were packed together so it didn't look like the damage took place during shipping . edited note : today is may 30 , 2009 and i just wanted to post that amazon wrote to me and told me this problem has been rectified . i'm happy about that because i need to get these for my dog and at times they are hard to find . plus it's a great product .

thank you good start the hospital recommended enfamil and baby seemed to do fine on the canned enfamil . we had samples of the powder enfamil at home and used that for about 4 days when my baby was fussy , gassy and seemed in pain during and after drinking a bottle . we switched to similac gentlease which was very bubbly and hard to mix . that didn't help at all . . . she was grunting in severe pain all day and night and we were miserable . we switched then to the soy version of similac which worked great , however a week into it i read that some countries actually ban the sale of soy for infants and that one serving on soy to a baby is like giving her 5 birth control pills . there really isn't any research on the long term effects of soy on babies so i didn't want to take any chances 'if' i could find something she could tolerate that wasn't soy . thankfully i found good star with comfort proteins . within the first feeding she was so much different and calm . we've been using it for over a month now and extremely happy . it really makes me mad to know that the hospitals are under contract with similac and enfamil and tell mothers they should stick to those 2 brands because they do all the research and all the other companies just copy ( acting as if anything other is inferior ) . well if it wasn't for nestle good start , we would have had to resort to soy and we didn't want to do that . by the way , i tried sam's clubs version of this with whey protein . not only did it smell terrible ( like the soy ) , but my baby was very gassy on it and hated the taste . i was really hoping she would like sam's club's version of this because the price was about half the cost of nestle good start . i am now staying with nestle despite the high price .

most won't eat them i take in stray cats . i currently have 14 . when one comes down with something possibly contagious , all go on antibiotics . the other week i picked up some antibiotics at the vet and then went and got these at the pet store ( $ 8 ! ! ! ) . i was so happy that pilling this many cats was finally going to be so simple and easy for a change . imagine my shock and annoyance when 10 of the 14 refused to eat them . the four that like them , love them , but the rest smell them and walk away . 
=================
flavored coffee this is a great product if you like flavored coffee , which i do . however , the price has now increased beyond what i would pay for it in local retail outlets . the convenience of having it delivered no longer outweighs the price . it is almost a $ 1 . 00 more per pound through amazon .

good every once in a while , but not often the switch kiwi berry carbonated fruit juice tasted good , but it was too sweet and had too many calories for my liking . i could drink a regular can of soda . going forward , i probably would not buy this beverage because i do not like to drink that many calories ( 135 ) or sugar ( 33 grams ) in one sitting .

my favorite gopicnic choice first , as a celiac ( needing to be gluten - free ) , i've been a fan of gopicnic for a while . they're great for travel , providing a nice fill - in for the airline meals we no longer receive . really , they kind of remind me of the sorts of lunch packs a lot of kids get - - single meal , shelf - stable , with various bits and pieces ready to combine once you dig in . the problem i've had with gopicnic is that i'm picky , and i've found that while i enjoy * something * out of each package , most have at least one , often several , items i don't care for . this is the first gopicnic package i've found where i like * everything * included . the asiago cheese , while not something i'd immediately think of for pizza , works great . the turkey pepperoni is tasty ( although greasy , as any real pepperoni is going to be if stored at room temperature . ) i * love * the dried fruit in this ( pineapple and , uh , cranberries , i think ? i'd have to look up the second one - - but whatever it is , i like it . ) and while the dried fruit could probably double as a desert , the almond roca is awesome - - unless you're one of those weird folks who hates almond roca . and if so , then , well , why ? how can you not feel a shudder of joy every time you bite into a piece of that chocolatey , crunchy , toffee - esque goodness ? well , it doesn't matter - - your odd aversion toward almond roca is none of my danged business , really . any time i travel , i bring gopicnic with me . and unless i'm just feeling daring and want to pick up a box of some flavor i've never tried , this will be the only one i'll bring . to the gopicnic folks , a suggestion , if you don't mind : any chance of tossing in a wet - wipe or towel with this one ? the grease thing really calls out for it . and , thanks for making something tasty , portable , * and * gluten - free . traveling with gluten sensitivity is a real pain in the butt . figuratively , and otherwise .

great coffee doesn't come from the mega brands unfortunately if you are seeking for really great coffee you're not going to reach the pinnacle with any of the global mega brands . you need to think of coffee as a fruit , which it is , and therefore it needs to be fresh . local for a roaster that stamps the 'roast date' on the bag for a start ( not the 'best before' date which is often a year after the roast date ) . londinium espresso roast in london to your specifications , and ship worldwide at cost .

good product , flimsy packaging we use air popped popcorn to replace microwave popcorn after finding out that microwave popcorn is loaded with nasty chemicals . we've orded this product before and it came in a plastic jar with a screw top . since this product was no longer available on amazon , we ordered the bags . shipping was very fast but one of the four bags was broken and my popcorn became the " popcorn " used for packaging material . i barely started to open another bag and the plastic came apart , spilling corn in my kitchen . just beware there is some risk in ordering the popcorn in the plastic bags .

irish smoked salmon this was not our favorite smoked salmon through amazon . it's overly fishy tasting and the skin is on one side so it's not a net 3 pounds . the one we prefer through amazon is the 2 pound atlantic smoked salmon ( vendor is j . r mushroom ) and is fairly close to the scottish smoked salmon which is the gold standard . if you can splurge for the st . james reserve scottish smoked salmon ( can't remember the vendor ) , you'll be very pleased as we don't think it can be beat anywhere and is a very special indulgence over the holidays or any time you have a hankering for top notch smoked salmon . 
=================
best value , sorta but half expired i like the product and have been pleased with it from other vendors . i looked at all the vendors on amazon and found this one to be the best value on a delivered price per ounce value ( assuming you have amazon prime ) . however , the savings was very small compared to the next best value and this particular vendor shipped me containers that the date stamps showed they were already at least half expired . so if you are planning on storing this and not using it all within 6 months , i suggest you buy it elsewhere . if you plan to use it all within 6 months than it is the best value for your money ( maybe because it is discounted for being old stock ) . btw , amazon does not allow the return of these as the are classified as " grocery items " which are non - returnable .

the tails wag for this one i assembled my canine product testing panel - hunter , a 65 lb . golden retriever who has some weight issues and boston , a 35 lib mixed breed who has some dental issues . i offered the treats , both testers took them readily . boston retired to a comfortable spot and began to chew quite eagerly . hunter took the entire stick into his mouth which caused me some concern that he would choke on it . i ordered him to drop the stick , which luckily he did . i gave him back the stick but held on to one end so he could not take the whole thing in his mouth again . i kept hold of the ( now slimy ) stick until hunter chewed off a couple appropriate size chunks . once the pieces were a safer size i let him enjoy , which he definitely did . boston , meanwhile , was holding the stick between his paws and chewing on it , taking off bite size pieces . i had no concerns about how he was managing the product . both dogs were quite interesting in repeating the test . i offered the product again the following day . both dogs were quite eager . again boston had no problem managing the product in a safe manner . i gave hunter the stick but retained control of one end so he could not gulp it whole . he began to chew off a piece , and did eat the product safely . i inspected boston's teeth after he finished his portion and was pleased that there seemed to be some lessening in the tarter buildup on the back teeth . both of my dogs liked the product , although to be fair neither is very picky . i also offered the product to two other dogs , a 50 lib mixed breed who managed it quite readily and a 10 lb yorkie who chewed it a bit and then buried it . i am concerned that a larger , greedy dog like hunter could choke on this . i like that the product is low calorie but i think that at nearly a dollar a stick it is a bit pricey . i like that the sticks are hard enough to make the dogs chew . boston did seem to get some teeth cleaning benefits from the product . unfortunately due to the high price and the safety issues for hunter i probably will not be purchasing this again .

dented cans ! ! ! if i was reviewing only the beans , i give them 5 stars ! the beans are excellent . however , ordering them from amazon is not . my beans arrived with at least one dent in every can . after all this time , amazon hasn't figured out how to ship these without them arriving damaged .

great product i like the clear scalp because it actually manages to give a bit of the old feel back , without making my hair feel greasy as if i've left conditioner in it . i've used this for about a week now , and really like how it makes my hair look and feel . definately worth a try if your trying to avoid that brillo pad head of grey hair like me . i used to have to worry about greasy , oily hair back in the day . i searched out shampoos that would dry out the scalp and leave my hair less oily . well a handful of years ago i started to go grey , and when i went grey , i skipped right over the " salt & pepper " look and jumped from a dark brown to bob barker in what seemed almost overnight . now , i didn't mind losing my hair color at a young age . . . at least i still had a full head of hair which is more than i can say for several friends , but what i hated was that the grey hair was of such a different texture and feel from my regular hair . it was coarse , dry and wiry . suddenly shampoos like head and shoulders and pert we too harsh , and my scalp felt brittle . 
=================
warning extremely hot ! ! ! ! if you think you can handle try it hot hot hot hot hell hottt ! ! ! ! ! do not use to much its not for the weak try it you will love it too it's the ultimate hot sauce and has more than a little kick to it

stale - oil flavor - - won't buy these again i really loathe having to write a 1 - star review . however , i purchased a 6 - pack of these crostini without ever having tried them before . took one bite and couldn't take another . i don't know if it was this particular batch , or how it was stored in the warehouse . but the flavor i can only describe as rancid - oil . . . if you've ever tried to use olive oil way past the expiration date , and it has a stale taste and odor ? it's how these crostini tasted . my boyfriend , who has a more forgiving palate and less wasteful tendencies than i do , tasted them and agreed . not willing to deal with the effort of repackaging and shipping back to amazon , tossed them in the backyard for birds and squirrels . now , i have tried la panzanella rosemary mini croccantini , 6 - ounce packages ( pack of 6 ) from a local grocery store , and they are delish and addictive . very happy to see amazon offer these . they're on my amazon list and looking forward to replenishing as soon as the store - bought are done ! 
=================
bad shipping pero is an excellent substitute for coffee . my father has been drinking it for years . the product is awesome , however , when he received the package , 4 out of 6 canisters were broken open during shipping . he is elderly , 88 years of age , and to him it was to much of an inconvience to repackage everything and return them to the post office and ship them back so he obsorbed the loss . that was disheartening for me since i live several hours away and could not be there to help . product good shipping was very bad .

 $ 7 . 37 price increase in 3 months ? ! ? the last time i bought this item was exactly 3 months ago on april 12 , 2012 . the price was $ 28 . 62 , it is now $ 35 . 99 . that's a sharp increase of $ 7 . 37 in 3 months , which is a price increase of nearly $ 2 . 00 per lb . - and when you consider that this product is 61 % sugar , that's quite a price hike . at this price , traverse bay dried cherries costs more per lb . than the trader joe brand of montmorency dried sour cherries which are delicious and come in smaller bags . the whole point of buying bulk 4 lbs . is that you get a price break over buying smaller bags in grocery stores . not anymore . i'm gonna go to trader joe instead and buy their excellent dried sour cherries which are not as oily , and have a nice tartness . * * * update - aug . 17 , 2012 i just bought from trader joe their tart montmorency cherries 8 oz . bag for $ 4 . 29 yummy ! 
=================
good , but not the best out there . after reading the reviews i ordered this item ( 9 boxes ) . it looks and tastes more like regular wheat pasta , but the one disappointing quality of this pasta is that the spaghetti sauce slides off of it , instead of clinging to the noodles . my husband still prefers ancient harvest quinoa pasta , spaghetti style , supergrain , 8 - ounce boxes ( pack of 12 ) which is also less expensive , so i'm eating this to use it up . i won't re - purchase . 
=================
squirrels love it ! wish i could say this was a good investment , but it lasted two days before the creatures came back and i saw them digging in my garden . the deer off may be dear off but not squrriel off . 
=================
sympathy gift tower : product good , but they forgot gift card ! when i bought this ( 11 / 1 / 10 ) , this product was called broadway basketeers sympathy gift tower of sweets ( large ) . i see it's now called " . . . hanukkah gift tower . . . . " in any case , we had a death in the family , so this seemed an appropriate gift . the recipient said it was exciting to open each individually wrapped box and they enjoyed the contents . unfortunately , the gift message i wrote with my order wasn't anywhere in or on the product or package . so , during this stressful time , the recipient and their family had to make many phone calls to various family members to try to identify who had sent it . i felt terrible . i definitely didn't want to put any more stress on them . 
=================
great price , not what i was hoping for though . there's the original tang . there's the fruition tang that was around from 2008 to 2010 , which had extra vitamins ( b , d , a , etc . ) and replaced half the sugar with zero calorie sweeteners . but tang has gone back to a flavor more similar to the original with full sugar content . i was hoping for the fruition version , which other reviewers received . 
=================
torani changed their original hazelnut flavor ! have used the sugar - free hazelnut syrup for a couple years now . just got this 3 - pack and discovered the flavor is waaay different ; and not in a good way if you liked the original . the new product is quite 'artificial' tasting . called torani's and was told that 'yes' the formula had been changed and there had been so many complaints that they will soon be releasing the original flavor again ( which has a richer , more mellow taste ) but under the name 'classic hazelnut' . we will order again when it comes out . . . 
=================
contains ammonium chloride - it's not your typical licorice this licorice contains ammonium chloride . personally i got to like it after a few weeks of testing , but it's definitely an acquired taste ( ammonium chloride ! ) . don't buy this licorice thinking it's regular salty black licorice ( by some cats or coins if you're looking for that ) . 
=================
an acquired taste . . . let me start by saying these are not for everybody . in fact , my personal experience is that most non - indian people don't like them at all . i fall into a different category because i love indian pickles ( aka achar ) . indian food is about variety and these pickles certainly hold up their end of the bargain . if you've never tried achar , don't buy these until you try a single bottle first . i would describe the taste as astringent , hot and salty - - in that order . if i haven't scared you off yet then go for it . you might actually acquire a taste for them too . keep in mind that a little goes a loooong way . a typical serving is a tablespoon or two maximum . btw : it took me six months of eating indian food daily before i started to like achar - - but that's another story . 
=================
indian wedding dessert - granola this is a novelty granola , chocolate flavored with chunks of real chocolate , originally created as a confection for the wedding of an indian couple who work for the producer . it's delicious stuff and part of the profits are donated to food banks . however , this is a very high sugar , high fat granola ( the second ingredient after oats is cane sugar and the third is soy oil ) and undercuts the health reasons for eating granola in the first place . unless you run eight miles every morning before breakfast , you would not want to consume this every day . and please don't give it to your kids to " entice " them into switching from chocolate co co pops . this is to granola as chocolate milk is to milk ; strictly a novelty item or occasional treat . also makes a nice gift or door prize . 
=================
apricot kernals i have ordered the organic apricot kernels . proper research and understanding will dispel fears and knee jerk reaction about the cyanide component . cyanide is used in table salt , fish industry and pesticides . so unwarranted fear is unnecessary . unless someone eats way too many , it should not affect anyone . more people die of drug overdose such as taking aspirin and acetaminophen and than over consumption of food naturally made for us to consume and possibly heal naturally . ironically organic also takes care of pesticides problem . 
=================
this is all i ever use anymore i love this litter because . . . 1 . it completely eliminates urine odor . it doesn't smell like a litter box typically does ( like clay , urine and feces ) . feces do smell right after your cat uses the box , but this goes away . the idea that a cat litter is going to eliminate feces odor right when the cat goes doesn't make sense to me . . . it would have to be loaded with chemicals and perfumes , which i don't want . the odor goes away within a few minutes , and i just scoop out feces at the end of the day . 2 . it is very inexpensive . you only fill the box a small amount , unlike clay litters . i use it along with the feline pine self cleaning litter box , and this is the best value . i only have to buy a new bag of litter once or twice a year . 3 . it does not track nearly as bad as clay or other fine grained litters4 . biodegradable materialswhat would you rather have , a litter box with 3 or 4 inches of clay litter that starts smelling after only a couple of days and is disgusting and must be trashed by the end of the week , or an inch of feline pine , that does not smell and lasts for 2 weeks before needing to be changed ? i almost want to laugh when i go to people's houses and i see their disgusting clay litter boxes , or see people buying clay litter at the store . don't they know there's a way that is not only better for the environment , but doesn't smell and is a better value ? i would also like to note that my cat is one of those picky sensitive cats that will not use litters with a lot of perfume or with a texture she doesn't like . i purchased the generic pine pellets at the pet store once and she flat out refused to use them , but she ok with the feline pine pellets . to those who are saying fp is a " poor value " because you can buy horse pellets at the store and they are the same , first of all i have my doubts that they are exactly the same and break down the same . i also don't understand why it is even an issue , considering that fp is cheaper than clay cat litters and works better . personally i like shopping for cat litter and knowing that i am supporting a good environmentally friendly company , rather than a company that makes clay litter loaded with perfumes and chemicals . note about the price : i don't recommend buying it here on amazon . at most stores you can get a 20 lb bag for only $ 10 , i have even seen them on sale for $ 8 . i would never pay what amazon is asking here . 
=================
none broken in my packages . . . rate product , not packaging anyway . . . very sweet cookie . very sugary , a sugar cookie is more descriptive . . . very good for a sugar cookie though , guess i was expecting a buttery shortbread . . . a bit disappointed . all pepperidge farm cookies have great eye appeal , but they are run by big business . they hop theirs up with too much grainy sugar . . . just tried the milk chocolate chips kind too . . . not at all like homemade , because of the grainy , overly sugary taste . 
=================
food from china is killing our pets ! i used to feed these to my dogs with caution knowing that they come from china . the pet food store i bought them from got all the reports from the company about how good they are in quality . but even now the local * good * pet food stores are not carrying them . they don't want the liability of these items potentially harming and killing pets . it's not hard to do your own chicken jerky , or buy usa products . don't just reduce the amount of these you are giving , just stop giving them . let's buy from reputable sources . remember the pet food from china a couple of years ago that was killing pets due to a contaminant ? 
=================
too pricey i was happy to see varieties of starbucks coffee here in amazon especially my favorite kind , so i ordered it right away . however , i underestimated the size although it comes in 3 bags . but for $ 27 something , i'd rather buy it directly at starbucks stores because they are cheaper there . otherwise , very good coffee .

rock candy swizzle sticks rock ! purchased these clear rock candy swizzle sticks for my daughter's tea party baby shower . tied pink and blue ribbons around each stick . each shower guest will be given one of the sticks to stir their tea if sweetened tea is desired . these sweets will be a nice touch to our tea party . 
=================
beware : cats become addicts to this . . . just like the whisker lickins brand , cats seem to have a special preference for these treats ! i've tried different flavors and haven't found one yet that they don't like . all 3 cats agree with the review . 
=================
the strawberry tea this tea is just the best ever . i originally bought this tea in london , i struggled to find it here . until i found it on amazon . i have had a subscription for about a year now . the only problem is that the last 2 shipments have been for strawberry sensation and not for the original strawberry they are both good but i prefer the strawberry . does anyone know how to contact amazon regarding this concern ? i wouldn't mind having a subscription for both , but amazon . com doesn't have the option for the strawberry sensation and it's shipping me the wrong type of tea . does anyone know how to contact amazon regarding this concern ?

my cats do not like it we just moved , and can no longer buy the trader joe's cat food our two cats love . i ordered this because of the great reviews and healthy ingredients , hoping it would help one cat's health . ( he recently had an overnight stay in a vet's office because of tummy issues . ) well , the first time i put it in their dishes , both cats just sniffed it and walked away . later , one cat would take one in his mouth , then spit it out on the floor . these are cats who eat everything ( including things they shouldn't ) and get very excited for breakfast . eventually , they stopped even walking toward their dishes when i poured more food in . one cat was barely eating anything . the other one ( with tummy issues ) suddenly became more interested in eating leaves tracked in the house . finally , i broke down and bought them purina one indoor advantage cat food , hairball and healthy weight formula , 7 - pound bag at the store and they love it . plus the first ingredient is chicken ( not chicken meal or by - product ) , not green peas . right now they're eating half natural balance and half purina one , until they use up the bag . i'm sure this is great healthy food , if your cats will eat it . i did notice that they have very healthy looking stools in the ole litter box when eating it ( gross , but important , i know . the things we do for our cats ! ) hope this helps another person who really loves her cats .

arrived leaking the juice extract is delicious . the bottle was leaking when it arrived . there was no inner seal under the cap which probably would have prevented this .

liked the keurig better ! i bought a tassimo and i bought a keurig and i kept the keurig . the keurig was easier to use with the k - cups and they were much easier to find in the retail market . i also preferred the taste of the keurig coffee selection . 
=================
best price the best price i've found . i make english marmalades , jams and jellies , commercially for the farmer's market so really need to research prices so that i can continue to produce ! ! buying through amazon really helps me save on this necessary , but otherwise expensive item . now i have confidence that i can continue to make my great product and earn a little spare cash and serve the local community ! ! saving on this item really helps . thank you , pauline , " morganics "

wish i had looked these up i did want to try kale chips , having heard and read some good things . but i didn't bother to ask my friend who praised them what to look for , so when this was the first thing i saw i assumed they were legit . they taste ok , i assumed the raw dehydrated aspect was to blame , but seeing what they look when home - made and actually looking at these reviews and others i find out that they are way off . 
=================
very expensive i have tried these in the pet store ( pet co ) and they cost $ 11 dollars there , as i paid only $ 9 + $ 2 dollars for shipping for both pkgs . my dogs love them and they are made in the usa . . . i was using " wagin train " jerky , but it is made in china and there has been lots of uneasy talk about their products harming dogs . so i only look for usa products . only problem is they are way more expensive . 
=================
disappointed fazer chocolate is excellent chocolate . . . but hard to find . so , i was thrilled to find these bars on amazon . however , when i received the chocolate , it seemed like it had been sitting on the shelf for a while , and the expiration date was only 6 weeks away from when i received my order , which was frustrating . 
=================
the secret to great popcorn . if you're popping corn at home and it just doesn't taste right , it's because you're not using this . i tried various oils and butter flavoring with no luck . i finally read somewhere that movie theaters use coconut oil , and tried this . that was the answer . add a little butter salt , and you're all set . i'll never by anything but this . 
=================
updated : pup loves it . . . but he managed to break it i picked up the buster cube after reading some positive reviews on it . its a great toy , lots of fun and holds their attention for a long time . i put a handfull of kibble in it ( an amount that my pup would eat in a couple bites ) and he was occupied for at least a 30 - 45 minutes . i would 5 star it but it is its very noisy , even on carpeted floor , thats my only complaint . update : the buster cube didn't make it through the weekend . my dog was able to remove the center piece , and then proceeded to chew on it while i was out of the room . luckily i was only gone for a couple minutes and the center piece is still sort of functional . disappointing . 
=================
of course it tastes good all diabetics beware . this cereal has 50 to 75 % more sugar than frosted flakes . of course it tastes good and of course children will eat it . don't for a moment believe it's a " healthy " breakfast food . it's a children's sugar laden cereal marketed to adults - - which would be okay if the cereal just marketed itself as steeped in sugar . stay away if you need to watch your blood sugar . it's bad choice . 
=================
microwave your own tapioca puddingl please try that instead this is puzzling , since the pudding by thankyou is currently not available , because i did receive it via amazon about two weeks ago . well , it would have been terrific to give this product lots of stars and kind words . for several reasons , i can't praise this product except to say the label is very pretty , the can has a ring that holds well when you open the can , and the manufacturers use real sugar , not some corn - chemical sweetener . i did open a can of this ; the product is pale , liquid , and uses tiny bits of tapioca . no eggs , although eggs are traditional with tapioca pudding . if it's used again at our house , ( bought a six - pack of this ) some kind of protein powder to perk this up will be needed , and how do you keep it from making your stomach burn again ? the product is " a product of its time " , meaning it is an artificial pudding , very liquid , with artificial colors like tartrazine or yellow number 5 , and sunset yellow , or yellow number 6 . so now you know that if you invite friends and family for dinner and some in the group are on the feingold diet and are sensitive to and trying to avoid artificial colors and flavors , you cannot serve them this . sorry . in trying to make things easier , looks like we have made them difficult in other ways . it might be really neat if you made your own tapioca pudding rather than using this product , and i'm sorry if that sounds like a lot work , but you might enjoy it ; it might take about ten minutes in the microwave , eggs , milk , sugar , tapioca , salt , vanilla . recipes with how many and how much are on the internet . or it can be made in about twenty minutes uninterrupted using a saucepan on the stove , stir in a figure - 8 pattern to avoid scorching , and remove from heat when mixture just comes to a boil . it thickens as it cools . as for separating egg yolk from white , for the fancy meringue version of tapioca pudding , it's a skill that gets easier with time . one may just crack the eggshell and , while not puncturing the yolk at all , hold the yolk in half the shell while the eggwhite slips away by its own weight . maybe this skill isn't the same as sinking a three - point shot from way out ; nevertheless you might enjoy cooking your own pudding . very sorry could not recommend this canned thankyou product . 
=================
more like essence of cinnamon then cinnamon roll i don't like coffee and this k - cup is one of the reasons why . it doesn't taste anything at all like a cinnamon roll . i need a strong flavored coffee in order for me to be able to drink it . it kind of reminds me of taking medication . i only bought this coffee because i am currently on a diet and this is pretty much all i can have in the morning . maybe it is because i can't have any creamer , but just adding truvia doesn't help the taste of this coffee . with that said if you love chocolate then you will love donut house chocolate glaze donut flavored coffee ( with a couple packs of truvia it taste like eating a chocolate glaze donut ) and donut shop coconut mocha ( omg . . . this taste exactly like hershey's mound candy bar . . . i feel guilty drinking it , lol ) . 
=================
easy to use but . . . s & b wasabi is very easy to use . it is packaged in a nice squeese tube . however , the so - called wasabi just tastes like horseradish made with green food coloring . if you are a picky fan of sushi as i am , it might be best to look elsewhere for the wasabi experience that you are looking for . 
=================
decent flavor , difficult packaging it will never be as nice as fresh pesto , but i find the flavor of this pesto paste comparable with other pestos i've bought in jars . the tubes are very difficult to use , however . i bought them imagining that the pesto would squeeze out smoothly like toothpaste , allowing me to dispense just the right amount for each dish and leaving no mess behind . unfortunately , the tubes are metallic and hard to squeeze smoothly . after the first few squirts they don't want to dispense anything at all . i have had to cut the back end off of each tube in order to get the pesto out . at that point , of course , it's like dealing with an ice cream cone when you've bitten the bottom off . unless you want to spend a lot of time cleaning up a mess of green oil , i suggest choosing a pesto that comes in friendlier packaging . 
=================
hold the mayo ! if you love mayonnaise with a cheap , high school cafeteria twist , then this is the one for you . absolutely no pep ! it totally disappears on sandwiches . i have had it within my household three times ( not my doing ) , and the third time was definitely not a charm . go for hellman's if you want that perfect tang . update on 4 / 8 / 12 : i was recently informed that this mayo has no added sugar . 
=================
fits nicely into kong it fits nicely into kong and keeps dasher busy . however dasher vomitted after eating it . not sure whether he's not used to this new treat . 
=================
love the product but cancelling my subscription - amazon raised the $ $ i absolutely love this stuff ! i don't drink coffee but used to be addicted to the energy drinks . . . a few years ago a friend suggested that i try crystal light instead - have been hooked ever since . it doesn't give you the jitters , doesn't give you a crash after and you get a whole bottle of water with every serving ! when i signed up for auto shippment in oct 2010 ( 6 boxes every 2 months ) it was an ok deal ( $ 18 w / free shipping ) . then i got real excited when the price kept dropping . the last two shipments they only charged me $ 10 ! ! ! ! stoked ! ! but i just got my email saying my next shipment will arrive soon - but they are now charging over $ 20 ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ummm doubling the price basically over night with no warning ? ? ! no thanks : ( i have cancelled my subscription and will now just get it from target like i used too . . . bummer . . .

same old fun dip , but limited selection i was disappointed to find that it was only apple and cherry in the pack , and no grape . but it was a good purchase , but i would not buy unless they had a pack with some grape flavoring in it . 
=================
love getting expired food ! i love getting a case of cereal in oct , 2012 when the product expired in june of 2012 ! amazon still shows two in warehouse with more arriving soon so be careful when you order !

a sweet little snack i've never reviewed a cookie before this one , but i'm going to do my best to describe the experience of eating it and provide other information that might be of value . these cookies are circle shaped , with their circumfrences probably about half again that of a large cracker . despite the name they're fairly thick . the ingredients they contain are pretty basic and mostly all - natural . a serving size is three cookies , which will not be terribly filling but will probably be fine for those who want a midafternoon pick - me - up or to walk away from a large meal with a little sweetness on the tongue . it's 140 calories per serving and is a bit heavy on the fat ( 5 grams a serving , which comes close to being 2 grams a cookie ) but then , it is a cookie after all . flavor is very much a matter of personal opinion , but i think it tastes great . the brown sugar and dried blueberries are more or less equally present , and the distinct but complementary interplay of two mildly sweet flavors is more interesting than i would have expected from a cookie like this . it's not going to satisfy a hard - core sweet tooth , but then that's hardly what this sort of product is meant to do . texture - wise , it's just a little bit crispier than i'd like , but not to the point that this takes away much from my enjoyment of the product . and , while not exactly moist , the cookies are not at all dry , either . and , since the package seals quite efficiently , i don't see them drying out in the cabinet . my only other complaint is that quite a few of them arrived broken . not only is this a mess , it makes it much harder for me to keep track of how many cookies i'm eating ; and since each one packs a fair amount of fat , i definitely don't want to go over . but , i guess , that's the way the cookie crumbles . 
=================
no gmo ingredients in g & b bars it's interesting to read that some reviewers are saying the bars contain gmo ingredients . the information is erroneous . green & black's does not use gmo soy lecithin or any other gmo ingredient . this is taken directly from their website : are your products gm - free ? yes - as all of our products are certified by the soil association , this ensures no genetically modified ( gm ) ingredients are used in their production . just fyi , the soil association is the uk equivalent of the nop here in the us , the organic certification body . they're very strict . 
=================
satisfying lollipop this lollipop is not one that you can chew or break with your teeth , you have to suck on it til the very end . so , if you're one that likes to chew on your lollipop , these are not the lollipops for you . this is the kind of lollipop where you taste the flavor and want just a little more so you just keep it in your mouth until it's gone . kind of like a cheeze - it where you get a taste of cheese , not quite enough , and it leaves you wanting more . this might sound like a bad review but it isn't . i like lollipops that aren't sugary tasting and have enough of the right flavor to keep me interested . frankly , their addictive because you get the chocolate , butterscotch ( my fave ) , latte , etc . flavors in a long - lasting treat . also , found this to be an alternative treat to sugary alternatives like processed cookes and candy that just don't taste good like they used to when i was a child . 
=================
an alternative form of sweetener xylitol is available from a wide variety of sources . it is a form of tree sugar , originally found in willow trees . it has less calories than sucrose , and metabolizes differently . you would need to consult with your physician if you are diabetic . one of the main attributes of xylitol is that is protects against tooth decay by changing the ph level to suppress bacteria causing both tooth decay and bad breath . rubbing xylitol against a tooth can give temporary relief from a toothache ( but see your dentist ) . xylitol is usually available in both granules and powder form . publications are sold separately giving directions for use in baking .

i bought it for $ 5 . 00 ! ! ! ! ! i bought this product at tj maxx for $ 4 . 99 . i had not tried it before but wow ! ! ! , the combination of flavors lingers on the palate perfectly . i had no idea of the actual cost until i got to the bottom of the jar . i went back to tj maxx and bought two more .

tea is great , but amazon's price is not ! i love amazon , and they are always very competitive so i am shocked at this outrageous price for this product . any search engine query for this same brand , product , and flavor will bring in much better prices , around 50 cents a cup . for 48 cups , amazon's $ 39 price tag is just over 81 cents a cup ! i buy other k - cups from amazon , but not for this flavor / brand . 
=================
look at the price ! ! ! you are kidding about the price right ? ? $ 7 . 66 a box ? ? glad you can afford that , i can't . . . . this is by far the best flavor ever , but not in my budget . . 
=================
really yummy kellogg's crunchy nut is one of the few " tasty " cereals i've had that is not " go into a coma " super sweet . at first blush i just thought it would be frosted flakes with a nutty taste added in , but it is far different . althought similar in look to frosted flakes , the " frosting " almost like maple and it's more like a glaze , but very good . also the peanut addition is wonderful with actual nuts on the flakes . it somewhat hard to pin down a similarity to this cereal - frosted flakes is not a good comp as it tastes nothing like it . i remember a cereal that had flakes topped with maple syrup taste and from what i can remember , this is similar , but the addition of peanuts makes it completely different . conversely the kids didn't really like it , although 2 of my 3 kids now have decided they don't like peanut butter , so maybe that has something to do with it . . . eitherway this is definitely something i will be buying again - if for no other reason than dad will have a good tasting cereal in the house that is " just dad's " !

fail ! this product fails to repel rats . period . my sister had a rat come down from the ceiling into her cabinet where she came face to face with it eating a bag of rice . it ran and she called me . we took everything out of the cabinet , vacuumed the droppings and then saturated the cabinet with critter ridder . i also went into the attic and sprayed all over . we waited a day , and then when she opened the cabinet to put everything back , the rat was again staring her in the face ! at that point i tried another repellent called repels allbonide 238 1 - quart shot - gun repels - all animal repellent ready to use . i again saturated the inside of the cabinet with it and also sprayed in the attic . in addition , i threw some rat bait into the cabinet . next day , the rat poison was gone , and droppings were left in it's place . repels all had different ingredients but also failed . the guy at do - it - yourself pest control said these items didn't work , but i didn't want to use a trap and have to clean up the mess . at that point i put more rat poison in the cabinet and i can hear the rat eating it right now ! total heebee geebees . i'm not sure if the contrac rat and mice killer is working yet , but i know that the rats love eating it .

victor mole traps - out of sight these are much more difficult to set and move than the other victor spear - type models . when " hunting " moles , you must move the traps frequently and this out of sight version is cumbersome .

disappeared too quickly we have purchased these several times . this past time our dog got it out of the holder and ate the whole thing in less than an hour . too expensive to have it last this short of time .

sushi making one bite at a time i purchased this product ( 3 packs ) to make sushi for our family of four . the nori or seaweed wrap is very small , a little less than 2 " x 4 " which makes it very hard to make a simple california roll with crab , cucumber , and avocado . once rolled it wasn't quite big enough to cut , but also made a much bigger single piece of sushi . the sticky rice was exremely sticky and we had more rice than what the 10 sheets of nori could take . don't recommend for family dining unless your family is looking for a snack and some sticky fun , however , may be perfect for the single person with time to play or only likes a single item in their sushi . i'll buy the bigger sheets for sushi next time . . .

not the best quality or price i first purchased this product for $ 28 . 00 and that was a good deal , but they just had to raise thereprice to over $ 32 . 00 for ( 6 ) 16oz packs and they are now to costly . the bob's ( 4 ) 32oz packs at $ 32 . 78 is a much better deal and i believe a better product . you get a total of 104oz with bob's , and only 96oz with eden . use a rice cookerforget the directions and use one part quinoa to two parts water . ( like you are making oatmeal ) it will then be a better replacement for rice , much healthier , and with the added benefit of adding fiber which will definitely clean you out . i also don't wash it as directed , as you would have to do with red quinoa , and the washing can loose a lot of the product down the drain . 
=================
not so long lasting i have 2 young labs who really enjoyed these chews , but the long lasting is a little deceiving . i thought it would take days for them to soften the chew and get little pieces off it , but they didn't last more than 2 hours . while i would purchase this item again as a special treat , they are a little expensive for all the longer they lasted with my dogs . i would not recommend this for aggressive chewers .

necco wafers product arrived in quick time , but half of the packs had lots of cracked wafers . not sure how much better they could be packed .

santa's house & toy shop i have been buying gingerbread house kits for several years at costco and have always been happy with them . this year they changed the style to the one i'm commenting on . i was disappointed with the santa's house & toy shop . i bought two kits and both had broken pieces that i had to glue together before i could even begin to assemble them , not to mention the candy canes that were obviously broken before they were even packed in the kit . also , the pre - printed sides were backwards , leaving me to have one rough side exposed with the windows facing inward . i guess i was spoiled with the previous kits i've bought , never a problem with any of them . i usually buy three kits every year . i assemble them before thanksgiving and as part of our thanksgiving day tradition my three grandchildren decorate them . regardless of the quality of the kit , the kids enjoyed them which is all thatreally matters . 
=================
safer moth control is no good i have returened the item because it didn't catch any moth fly in 15 days while another brand i got on the same purchase was filled with stuck moth flies . ( springstart biocare ) is the best . it keep catching more and more moth every day . 
=================
you might as well buy cornflakes i enjoy the occasional bowl of frosted flakes , but like everyone i also like to cut back on my sugar intake . so when i saw this reduced sugar version , i decided to try it . unfortunately , the lack of sugar on the flakes ( which i did not miss ) made the flakes completely soggy once they hit the milk . for this reason , you might as just buy cornflakes , which do hold up in milk . i agree that you don't miss the sugar , however , the taste isn't as strong either . 
=================
flavorful , but difficult to store and use i had been using this product to make homemade nicaraguan chorizo . this product is indeed flavorable and authentic . however , i found that it dries out and hardens before i have the chance to use all of it , even if kept in the plastic bag it's packaged in and then sealed inside a tupperware container . for this reason , i now order annatto ( achiote ) powder instead , and add additional flavorings to it , according to a recipe in one of my nicaraguan cookbooks . i figure i can't get more authentic than to use a cookbook that was published in nicaragua ( not here in the states ) and use the exact ingredients the recipe calls for . i can also control the ingredients to avoid unnecessary preservatives and such . 
=================
it was only okay . this product didnt really make as much as a difference as i would have liked !

wow ! ! awesome . . . wow man ! ! awesome price $ 1 . 99 for 6 mangoes and roughly $ 12 shipping . almost right price matching with my local store here selling for about $ 12 - $ 15 for 6 mangoes . . oh wait ! then why am i giving 1 star . . or maybe negative star . am i missing something here ? of course , duh . . price is $ 199 & for some reason no free shipping ! ! friends , don't buy it here . if you plan on buying 36 mangoes , then for that price , you can go round trip to india , stay for a month , eat delicious / fresh alphonso mangoes daily , give remaining 6 to this spiceworld site and ask them to sell it to one customer at reasonable price so they get 1 + rating by at least one person ! !

we made our own sausages ! so first time we tried to make our sausages ! i did a bunch of research and these skins seemed to hit the mark based on the website specs for what we wanted . we made various styles of meat sausages and the skins wokred out great , you have to be very careful not to over fill them , but this is more of a user controlled thing than anything that the skins could do differently . the onyl downside for me was the quantity , i would have preferred multiple smaller packets inside the pouch , there was so much skin that you could have made sausages for a family for a year ! the product packaing suggested that the skins wouldnt last that long once the seal was broken so we prepared them all in water ahead of time and then tossed the stuff we didnt use . 
=================
ridiculously overpriced on amazon but great product hence the 1 star crunchy , not too salty , always very fresh when i've bought these at publix . publix has them on sale from time to time for $ 4 . whole foods price is usually around $ 5 . no idea why you buy 3 and pay about 100 % more . amazon needs to evaluate the price - perhaps should be a 8 pack for the same price . 
=================
new formula fails i started using cytomax back around 2001 , and it was the most amazing sports drink i had ever had . taste , performance , ease of use ; it had it all . i read the reviews here discussing a formula change , and went ahead and gave it a shot . i'm halfway through my newest container , and it's just not working . the taste is subtly off , and viscosity / texture of it is subtly off as well . finally , and i have no way of explaining this at all , i think it actually gives me a light headache when i'm drinking it . performance - wise , i think it generally still works , in that it provides some calories and hydration for longer workouts . but i don't like drinking it . all said , i will never buy it again . i will test out accelerade lemon lime 60 servings and hammer products , etc , and see which one is the best , and go with that . new formula fails . 
=================
good flavor , but tooooo sweet the walnut & date has a good flavor , but it's way too sweet . my husband has a sweet tooth and he also thinks it's too sweet . i ate one bar last night and it made my stomach uncomfortable . 
=================
don't bother with this fig jam ! i have become obsessed with trying every fig jam and preserves and chutneys i see available . they are truly wonderful with goat and sheeps milk cheeses . there are many brands which are simply wonderful - unfortunately this one is not ! the flavor is not rich and figgy - it tastes diluted and flat . the consistency has too much gelatin in it so it is not smooth and creamy as it should be . i keep my fig preserves in the refrigerator for ages - and they never , ever go bad - i had one in there for over two years . this brand however , actually went moldy after a couple of months ! ! good riddens to the most disgusting fig jam i've ever had ! now for some recommendations for delicious brands : bonne maman fig preserves ( france ) is widely available and very nice - creamy with a nice fig taste . the adriatic fig spread ( croatia ) is very widely available - it has a rather bright , fruity taste , a bit more tangy - but also nice . l'epicurien ( france ) makes a bunch of fig products - some which i haven't tried yet - but the one i have tried is their fig and walnuts confit . it is pricey for the size ( only 4 . 4 oz ) but it divine - really indescribable - very rich and intense - somewhat sweeter than regular fig preserves - worth trying at least once . and finally is the vergers de gascogne fig jam ( france ) imported in us exclusively by williams sonoma - and as far as i know - only available in their stores - not on their website . this one is amazing wonderful - a classic - call them and find out how to order . i have another 6 brands in my pantry ready to taste - but too soon to recommend . but don't waste your money on this one - that is for sure . . . 
=================
healthy alternative - mixed taste review i want to preface this review and say that if you want a really healthy alternative to pasta then you may want to try these . my husband really likes using these for a zero calorie option . i , on the other hand , will not eat them . they still have a fishy type taste and the texture is very different . no matter how we prepare them i can still taste the weirdness and would rather have the calories from real pasta . my husband has an easier time getting over the taste and taking them for what they are . for health nuts who can't or won't eat real pasta this would be a good product to try and see if its something that you enjoy . 
=================
hormel's chili master each person has their acquired taste for chili . the added tomato flavor makes this a big hit for me . however , the price is outrageous . this same item can be found elsewhere on internet for less than $ 3 per can . this sells at $ 5 per can . i'll pass based on pricing alone . 
=================
wal * mart 4 . 95 you can buy this at walmart for 4 . 95 for a kit . i got burned last year , i paid 19 . 98 for 1 of these . 
=================
this sellers price is a rip off you can get this at wholefoods for 8 . 99 . dont buy from this place . they are taking advantage . when amazon did have it in stock , it was 24 . 99 for 3 ! ! as for the produce , it is the best ! deep dark choco flavor and it's perfect for my morning banana sunbutter protein smoothies . 
=================
coffee been home roasting for two years now . i use an i - roast ii , but stop by sound , sight and smell . i would not recommend the light roast that the company claims it is blended for . the mixture of bean types and sizes just do not really allow all of the beans to roast to same level . this is true of a darker roast as well , but at least all the beans make it to / through first crack . not the best blend i've experienced , but satisfactory . i roast at fc + , with some beans falling into the french roast catagory . tough to beat the price and the beans were dry . i'll buy again , but not too soon . may give some of their others a try . arrived very quickly . that impressed me . i usually buy from sweet maria's but their arrival is usually about a week or so . my decision to buy was more out of a need to get some beans quickly , as i was down to my last couple of roasts of the beans i had left . give this one a try . it may be to your taste . it will still certainly taste better than folger's , no matter how melange the roast . 
=================
migraine food ! sure they're tasty , but they trigger a migraine in msg sensitive people . also , they contain corn , which also contributes to their tastiness i'm sure , but seems silly for a " rice " chip , which is what i thought i was buying to avoid corn . 
=================
decaf the product is probably fine , but i failed to note that it was decaf . i got excited about the price and flavor ( my wife's favorite ) and failed to notice the decaf . unfortunately i am now stuck with several unopened boxes i can't return due to the return policy that would not exist if i just paid regular price in a store . no problem with the coffee ( my wife loves the regular ) , just be careful as you can't correct for quick reads . 
=================
misleading product description - note that this is a blend ok . i admit it . i didn't scrutinize the full product description nor study the picture of the bag before purchasing this product . i purchased this product thinking that it was 100 % kenya coffee . nowhere in the product title or in my invoice did it say it was a blend . you had to look at a closeup of the bag or read through the romance description in order to get an inkling . even then , they use the word blended in the description which can have a different meaning than the word blend . why is this important ? there are no worldwide standards for what percentage of a coffee's orgins are needed in order to make a claim . for example , kona coffee does have a standard for blends , where at least 10 % needs to be sourced from kona in order for it to be called " kona blend " . in this case , as long as there is some kenya coffee in this product , copper moon can call it a kenya blend . amazon should make this clearer . 
=================
good coffee - one of my favorites by tassimo i understand that there's no universal coffee that everyone loves . everyone has unique tastes and preferences . but for me , this coffee is great . i've bought starbucks and seattle's best coffee for tassimo , as well as other designer coffees as well . pretty much everything tassimo t - discs have to offer . i guess i don't have expensive tastes or something , because this maxwell house is the cheapest tassimo has to offer , and i like it the best . i just bought 2 boxes yesterday , and amazon lowered the price by 25 % in a single day ! what the heck ? ? yes , i know this seems expensive to the lay person , who might be new to tassimo or is thinking about buying one . if you don't have a tassimo machine yet , don't get one ! unfortunately , i'm stuck with one , so i'm forced to use it , but the coffee t - discs are just way too expensive . buy a keurig . you'll pay more for the machine , but you'll pay less for the coffee , and you'll have a lot more options . i don't like my tassimo , but i refuse to buy a new machine when mine works perfectly . i do like this coffee , however ! 
=================
lovely basket , poor delivery time this basket was purchased as a gift for a grieving family . i'm sure the basket was beautiful although we did not see it ourselves . i paid for expedited delivery so that it could be received within days of the funeral . however , it did not arrive until one week later , the same delivery time as regular rates - that was disappointing . 
=================
the only coffee i can drink , but ouch the price ! this is the only coffee i can drink . any other decaf upsets my stomach in the middle of the second cup . unfortunately , it is very expensive at just under $ 5 per tub . that price is ridiculous , and when i see it here for more than double what it is at the grocery store it is really outrageous . 
=================
strange little nut ! i love these nuts . i have been eating the cocoa ones . tried these for the first time this week . i found all five nuts , cashews , almonds , walnuts , pecans , & brazil nuts . but there also is another nut in the mixture not listed . looks like a macadamia nut . but doesn't seem to taste like one . so we really have six nuts in our canisters . lol great not have the peanuts . 
=================
yummy dog treat i opened the packages , and pulled out one of the biscuits . they are shaped as two pieces that can easily be broken in half . each 1 / 2 piece is a bit large for training , i would prefer smaller bits , but the 1 / 2 piece makes a nice mouthful for a medium sized dog ( 45 lb ) . the biscuits are a rather drab brown , a simple rectangular shape , very utilitarian , favoring function over form . now the real test . i gave one to my dog . she was hesitant at first , but gave in and attacked the treat with gusto . her normal behavior for getting a treat is to sit . once she finished the first treat , she got into the sit position , and stared intently at me and the bag , eager to earn another . i gave her a second , and it was gone in moments . i then placed her regular treat ( a milkbone ) 2 feet apart from one of these treat , made the dog wait for 15 seconds . when i let her go , she went first for the newman treat . once gone , she went just a quickly to the milkbone . hardly a scientific test , but interesting all the same . as for the packaging , the item says it's a 6 - pack of treats , but i received only a single bag of treats . for the price , this is in no way worth it for a single bag . for 6 bags , however , this would be competitive with " name brand " snacks , and the ingredients list would cause me to choose this first . 
=================
it's like drinking bile i really like their regular tomato soup , so figured i'd try this . well , life is all about figuring out what you like and don't like , so i'll take this as a lesson learned . the good thing is that it tastes the same going down as it does coming up . 
=================
awful bags i love these chips , but for some reason all the bags i ordered i couldnt open , , , everyone in my family tried but np one can open them ! plesase help ? ?

uh - it's mac - n - cheese it's a different box , but the ingredients look , smell and taste the same so what's the big deal . it seems to me that all this is , is the same old product in a new box . ok , new and improved ( ? ) box . but the inside seems exactly the same and the preparation and taste are the same . it's sad to think that some one in r & d at kraft said , " hey , let's add the word veggie or vegetarian or vegan to that old standby mac - n - cheese and see how many people we can fool into thinking that it's a new product " . so i'm cynical . . . can you blame me . zeb kantrowitz

mountain tea ( igourmet ) i found that this tea was better in taste , flavor and smell in comparison to the other brand sold by parthenon foods . this tea is consistant to what i grew up to drinking . i recommend this product . in addition , igourmet shipped the order within a reasonable amount of time . 
=================
beware they taste fine but definetly not peach . they're a bit softer than haribos , which i prefer . the sweetner used causes a laxative effect , fast acting i might add . it would be different for everybody but for me i can safely eat 7 or 8 rings . if you exceed the amount your body can tolerate you better plan on staying very , very near the bathroom for an hour or two . if you need a laxative these work well but you'll be sorry if you eat too many . not for children ! 
=================
o expensive you can buy lipton for less than 4 . 00 / 6 oz and 6oz at dollar generasl for 1 . 00 . they dont have anything special . green tea is tea that hasn't been ferminted to make it taste bitter . green tea is great and cheap and so is tomatoe juice : )

double bubble gumballs this was a super value for the money - my son got a large gumball machine for his birthday and everywhere else i could only find small bags - this box was reasonably priced and filled the machine twice ! 
=================
sweet n' low liquid my family uses the sweet n' low liquid . we like it very much , not only because we are cutting out sugar , but also the convenience ofturning up a bottle for a few drops of sweetener instead of havingto open a package and wonder how much to put in our coffee ! for convenience of ordering click on amazon . com and go to grocery . gloria wells
=================
decent noodles but not gluten free these noodles contain wheat - - which last time i checked has gluten in it , so i guess it is obvious that you should not buy if you are allergic to wheat . the non - allergic people in our family ate the noodles and they taste like normal noodles but are green . nothing too exciting . 
=================
dinty moore meatball stew purchased for elderly mom . texture of product soft , takes seconds in a majic bullet to furthly reduce texture . easy to remove flip top lid to can . good taste . . . i was suprised . 
=================
these tend to be good i've had four or five of these cans , and the olives are consistently decent , but not great . they're appropriate for the price , and very pleasant . the last can i received was a mess , though . there were no herbs whatsoever , and every single olive was inferior , be it discolored , mushy , or with borer holes . i think they accidentally packaged the rejected olives . major bummer , but how the heck did that make it past quality control ? 
=================
vanilla aroma 4 / 5 , actual vanilla taste 1 / 5 i'm going to admit i'm a coffee addict but not a starbucks fan . assuming you like starbucks coffee ( if you don't know . . . just go to a shop before you buy a package ) , this is a drip grind , medium strength . it's definitely not a french / dark roast . it wouldn't hold cream well at all without over - powering it . that said , there is barely any vanilla taste to hit although the grounds have a strong vanilla aroma . in general , a hazelnut coffee has about 3x the flavored taste as this does . yes i do realize vanilla is a much more subtle taste . i would recommend either adding a drop of vanilla extract , shot of vanilla syrup or vanilla cream to your already favorite cup of joe . 
=================
they're ok , but not great . i was sort of excited to try these because licorice is one of my favorite sweets & i'm always eying up new flavors to try out . this just sort of seemed a natural fit for me as far as a vine review goes . the good thing is that the texture to these are pretty good . it's nice & chewy without being too chewy or too soft . it's a happy medium , although i do recommend that you try to get these as fresh as possible since i can't imagine trying to eat these when they've a little old or have been exposed to air & not stored properly . the bad thing is that these just have this funky aftertaste to them . the basic taste is fine enough . it doesn't taste like pomegranate & normally i'd be ok with this since candy often labels things " watermelon " or " strawberry " when it doesn't taste anything remotely like the fruit . since this is supposed to be mostly organic & natural , i really expected it to taste more like actual pomegranate . then there's the occasional weird aftertaste these have to them that's somewhat unpleasant . i can't really explain it but it's not a taste that i'd really care to have in my mouth . one thing i do want to mention is that out of the 11 ingredients in this product , only 3 are organic . that doesn't bother me much , but i know that there are some people who get irritated at how some labels mention " organic " but only a small part of it is actually organic . at that point you really can't call the product organic since it has non - organic product in it . ( there's no usda organic label on this anywhere , if you were wondering , which can only be put on if a certain percentage of the product is organic . ) note that this product didn't have " made with organic ingredients " on it , just " made with organic sugar " . the people who label watch for organic products will know what that means . i mention all of this because i know some are very picky about product that have organic anywhere on it . overall i wasn't really that enthusiastic about this product . it wasn't horrible but i can safely say that i probably won't be buying any of these in the future . i might & i stress * might * try one of the other flavors , but that'd only be if the price was right . edit : updated to say that i won't be buying any of this in the future . the licorice i ate later is really making me feel a little gross . like another reviewer said , it's just sitting there like a pile of lead & is giving me some pretty bad indigestion . if you have a cast iron stomach ( which admittedly mine isn't as strong as it once was but is still pretty good ) , then you probably won't have a problem with this . this has to be the first licorice product that has remained unfinished in my house ever .

pupperz dug em pit terrier and cockapoo loved these a bit more than the other treats we had . was it the ranch flavor ? was it the texture ? we can only speculate , but they know for sure ! oooh , those nummerz treats they love to munch ! grama even ate one by mistake ! 
=================
made my kid feel really strange . . . my vegetarian 4 year old reported that she felt really strange after she took these vitamins . i honestly think they gave her too much energy because she was very moody on these vitamins . i stopped the vitamins and she felt better again . she usually takes rainbow light kids one multistars and does not have any issues whatsoever . these vitamins seem like a great option for others out there .

stinky city ! i am the proud momma of three amazing kittens . ages 2 , 3 , and 6 months . i have been stressing what to feed them and how to find the 'kitten fountain of youth' bella has dry skin issues , it didnt seem nearly as bad one this food so obviously , i wanted to like this food , i got a good price on it ( sticker on the bag at petco was 5 dollars off , and it was sale ) i got it home and opened it up , and man did it stink ! i ended up giving them the whole bag ( i'm not about to throw money away ) but , since i bought a big bag , i can safely say the next two months where quite . . . strong . used a lot of air freshener , even with twice daily scooping . maybe with another kind of flavor , i plan to give it another go once the purina runs out .

not bad ! i bought this for my dog that doesn't play , but loves to eat . so i was hoping this would entertain him , but even this wouldn't do the trick . however , i broke it back out after i adopted a new dog for christmas . she eats her food much too fast , and in return has horrible gas . so , i started filling this with her kibble , and it slows her down , and keeps her busy for a good ten minutes . my older dog still won't play with it , but he will indeed follow her around and pick up any kibble left behind ! lol

disappointing . . . i've always preferred dark chocolate . ( not surprisingly , i don't care for chocolate made with dutched - - alkalai - treated - - cocoa . bleh . ) in college , i used to go out after dinner for a hershey's bittersweet bar . ( it was more bitter than the current special dark bar . ) i was expecting something spectacular from scharffen berger's 70 % - cacao bar , and was ( sorry ) bitterly disappointed . their description - - " bright fruitiness and a long , smooth finish " - - is accurate . ( the lingering bitter taste is especially pleasing . ) but there's insufficient " complexity " to justify a $ 5 price . the taste isn't sufficiently " better " ( or more - adult , if you like ) than a much - less expensive hershey bar . definitely / not / a treat to be savored , one small bite at a time . a " good " chocolate bar , but of questionable value . see if a friend will give you a bite before you commit to buying .

redbul it seems like im getting ripped off everytime i purchase redbull but at least i dont have to get off my butt and go to the store ! ! ! ! three dollars apiece is too much to spend on an energy drink that taste like pee . thank you amazon . 
=================
smelly , but my dogs don't swallow them whole at last , a dental chew that my one dog doesn't inhale in one bite . altho , it does smell pretty gross - - doggie chew on steroids , proteiny smell . i didn't detect any of the vanilla mint they were talking about in the description . i was pleased to see maggie the inhaler actually working little pieces off of these . her chomping down entire greenies has worried me in the past . because if it's in her stomach whole then it's doing nothing for her teeth . the smell , like many dog treats , is a little overpowering . but i'll put up with it , if it's actually helping get her teeth a little cleaner . 
=================
great sweetener , nice lemon scent , where's the lemon flavor ? my daughter brings flavored lemon water to school everyday and i was looking for an alternative to her splenda based lemon water . i thought this would be a great solution . unfortunately , even though this is a very nice sweetener the lemon flavor is barely detectable . the scent is great though ! in tea this is fine , but as a sweetener / lemon flavor enhancer for water , this is not a good solution - stick with real lemons and stevia . 
=================
starchy starch what can i say . . . it's tapioca starch . it behaves like tapioca , the product is clean and without moths , and . . . well , it is tapioca starch . it is the same starch that can be had for 69 cents at an asian store , but there are times when it is worth the extra $ 6 for convenience of home delivery over a 40 - mile one way trip . 
=================
yikes ! $ 7 . 77 for one 8 oz . bag i wish amazon would sell mahatma red beans with rice by the case - - two dozen bags ( or more ) would suit me . paying $ 7 . 77 for one small bag is simply not economical considering i want to cook some more often than once in a lifetime . the five - star rating is for the product , not for the means of obtaining it . 
=================
not really a gift pack . i purchased this " gift pack " for my cousin as a christmas gift . he loves hot sauces and i thought this would be the perfect " usable " gift . while he was very happy with the sauces ( before even tasting them ) , i was disappointed at the fact that this item was listed as a " gift pack . " when i think of a " gift pack " i think of something that is nicely boxed or packaged . what i received was a shipping box with 6 bottles of hot sauce , each individually wrapped in packing paper to avoid damage during shipping . they're fine - don't get me wrong - but not very presentable as a " gift . " 
=================
what a mess ! i was thrilled to see that i could get our favorite tartar sauce on - line - - our local shop had stopped carrying it . not so thrilled with the separated mess i received - - looked a little like blue cheese dressing ! also not so thrilled that it could not be returned . 
=================
real raspberry flavor i needed a pure , 100 % natural raspberry flavor for making flavored beverages . artificial flavoring just does not compare to the real thing . i bought this extract to see if it really was " berry enough " for my needs . . and it was . it tastes very potent . there is no doubt you are working with real berry concentrate . the liquid is deep red . there is no pulp or solids visible in the juice . i keep my bottle in the refrigerator because i don't think there are any preservatives in the product . over time it could begin to ferment so don't buy too much at once . 
=================
nice flavor . . . and great crunchiness . . . so good . . . very nice with several toppings . . . and nice as breading for chicken , pork , etc . since so many of them are broken at arrival . . . they find their way as coating for my frying . i'll avoid these until percentage of broken pieces diminishes . 
=================
one box was empty i ordered six boxes but one box was empty . i tried to contact someone to get another box but was not successful .

they changed the recipe . thye're not as good now . late july recently changed the recipe for their dark chocolate sandwich cookies without any direct notification on the packaging . they disappeared from the shelves in the denver area and when they reappeared , they were different . the new recipe isn't nearly as good . there's less of the intense cocoa taste that we enjoyed . they're drier . the cookie is more like a dry , less tasty cracker now . sure they're marginally healthier - a bit less fat , more whole grain and fiber , less sugar . that's fine , but the taste of the cookie has been compromised such that they're just less tasty , empty calories now at 50 calories a pop . we originally switched from newman's chocolate creme filled chocolate sandwich cookies to late july's because they were so much better . now they're not as good . we live pretty far from the denver area so we stock up occasionally . since there was no obvious notification of the recipe change on the packaging , i bought our usual supply for a couple of months . mistake ! i'll be donating several boxes to the local food pantry . hopefully , someone will enjoy them !

a first - rate cuppa java ! for what it is , i . e . , instant coffee , this freeze - dried concoction by nescafe , certainly delivers . according to the label , this coffee is processed from 100 % colombian arabica beans . . . the good stuff . now , obviously , you're not going to be fooled into thinkin' that this comes across as a melitta - drip kona brew . . . and it doesn't . but , if you're not lookin' to impress the neighbors [ or lord forbid , the relatives ] with the aroma of fresh - brewed , then this instant should serve you well . it is smooth , flavorful , and relatively robust . . . not as much as starbucks via , but very close . on the flip side , since the nescafe does not contain micro - grounds , it doesn't have the muddy texture of the via . as for preparation and clean - up , it couldn't be easier . . . zip , zap , pour , and stir . . . two minutes , tops . lastly , at less than two - bits per serving , the nescafe is at least three times less expensive than the via . there's yer 'bang - for - the - buck' . . . take that '4 - bucks' ! amended [ 21 jun 12 ] please be advised , that this product is not exactly as advertised . nescafe is engaged in some deceptive advertising schemes . on the coffee box , you will find claims like : " tasters choice colombian coffee is made from 100 % colombian beans . " . . . and . . . " tasters choice colombian coffee is made from the finest arabica beans . " now , i have no reason to doubt that these two statements are likely true . however , taken together , they imply that this product is made solely from arabica beans , which is , in fact , not true ! notice that they did not say : " made exclusively from arabica beans " . if you read the on - line product description , you will discover that this coffee is actually a blend of the superior grade arabica beans and the inferior grade robusta beans . think 'cya' disclaimer ! that certainly helps to explain why this coffee does not have the 'finestind' flavor and finish of my eight o'clock colombian roast . caveat emptor ! the instant coffee quest continues . . . stay tuned . . .

gave my puppy very loose stools we began feeding our 10 week old german shepherd puppy blue buffalo large breed puppy food , transitioning her from purina very slowly over the course of several weeks . initally she seemed to do fine but then began getting very loose stools . we couldn't even pick up after her . it was terrible . we took her to the vet for tests , added pumpkin to her diet , vet gave her probiotics , nothing seemed to help . after about 6 weeks of this ( and working unsuccessfully with my vet to find a solution ) i switched foods . in about 3 days her stools were nice and solid . while the ingredients in blue look good on paper , it just wasn't good for her digestive system . now feeding california natural lamb and rice puppy and she's doing great on it .

it's a poor substitute for fresh ground i really wanted to like this coffee . i wanted something that i could take to the office and use with my aeropress coffee maker or use when i wanted a quick shot of espresso without grinding the beans . however , i guess once you start drinking fresh ground you cannot go back to buying ground coffee . the date on the bottom of the can is over a year away , but the coffee still smelled stale to me when i pealed the metal top off the can . i tried it a couple times in my saeco made espresso machine . the crema was weak and the flavor was thin and slightly bitter . i poured it down the drain rather than finish it . i prefer illy's dark roast espresso , but my local grocer no longer carries it , probably because it did cost more than any other brand . i guess i should have heeded another reviewer . my favorite coffee is peet's and i think french roast is the peak of perfection . i like the beans dark and shiny . this coffee was a medium brown color , not the dark brown that i'm used to . there's a reason why espresso shops freshly grind the coffee , it really makes a difference and is worth the extra time , expense and effort . the baratza maestro plus is an excellent cone burr grinder ( . . . ) . it will give you years of service . i've tried cheaper ones and they just eventually die .

don't order this if on a low carb diet or diabetic the wrapper claims only 4 net carbs per serving ( 1 / 2 the bar ) , subtracting 5g of fiber and 8g of maltitol from the total carbohydrates of 17g . maltitol has a relatively high glycemic index and based on what i've read , should not be discounted . i wouldn't waste my money if i were you .

daesang america rocks ! ordered the blackberry concentrate because i'd had it before . price was good , however amazon failed to pack 2 bottles and only 1 was delivered . i lodged a complaint and within 2 days i was contacted by daesang with a profuse apology and they sent me 3 bottles of concentrate and 2 bottles of vinki ! loved the customer service and loved the product . review update - the folks at daesang america , the distributor of this great product , truly raised customer service to a new level by sending me more samples after i ordered again thru amazon . both daesang and the chung jung concentrate are awesome !

disappointed overall i gave this as part of a secret santa gift for someone who loves to make guacamole . i was suprised to see that it's a condiment that you must refrigerate and use within a few days once opening rather than a dry seasoning . i paid too much for it given the cost of shipping only to find it available at my local waldbaums supermarket . i bought some for myself to taste what i had given as a gift and was simply not at all impressed by the flavor it added . this surprised me as i have seen chef bayliss' show on tv and expected something more . i should have known better . guacamole isn't difficult . avocados used at the right stage are delicious on their own . use cilantro , some sort of acid , lemon or lime , chopped onions , tomato and salt and you don't need anything else .

oatmeal raisin tastes terrible , pb and chocolate chip are ok these are the new " healthy " quaker oats 100 - calorie granola bars ; but don't let the name deceive you . while they may have zero trans - fats and no high fructose corn syrup , they're still chock full of other great things , like various preservatives , hydrogenated oil , artificial flavors , regular corn syrup , and combinations of fructose / dextrose . my advice is to buy the full - fat quaker oats granola bars which taste better anyhow ; just practice some self - control . however , since you've already chosen this variety pack , here's the review . the best tasting flavors are the peanut butter and chocolate chip ; the oatmeal raisin has virtually neither oats nor raisins , and tastes more like a barley / rice bar . somehow , the " oatmeal raisin " bar came with no raisins , and a much drier , barley - er consistency . what happened to the good ol' days when granola bars were primarily oats ? but i digress . thank goodness there are only 16 of the oatmeal raisin in the box , and more of the better tasting pb / choco . as for the chocolate chip flavor , they still have enough chocolate chips scattered about to resemble a chocolate chip granola bar , and somehow the ratio of oats to barley / rice is higher in this than compared to the oatmeal raisin bars . the bar isn't too dry , and you feel pretty good eating just one of them and only taking in 100 calories . only 100 calories ? hmm , i can afford to eat a few more . . . as for the oatmeal raisin , they're terrible compared to their low fat chocolate chip brethren . there's nary a raisin to be found , and somehow , the oatmeal to barley / rice ratio is very low on these compared to the chocolate chip version . if i wanted a barley / rice bar , i wouldn't have bought a product that said " granola " on the front . additionally , the bar is very dry ; i think the lack of a nice fat ( chocolate chips ) definitely leaves something to be desired . as for the peanut butter , they have a great peanut buttery flavor and taste . not much else to be said . buy these knowing you'll have slightly dry - ish oat / barley / rice bars , good for a nice snack . they're not especially healthy , but no one needs to know . shhhh .

bought from dig it bought from dig it pet products : the best by date had been rubbed off , so no way to tell if it is fresh . older packaging with the word 'feline' under the word 'pockets' rather than above the word 'greenies' . opened the package today ( 1 / 7 / 12 ) . they were all stale .

great alternative sweetener my review covers the stevia in the raw product in packet form . i have not tried the bulk product . this is a great alternative sweetener . it leaves no after taste that i can detect . i use it in tea , on cereal and in three different kinds of oatmeal . everything that i have used it in or on has tasted the same as it did when sugar was used . i cam accross a couple of articles on stevia while browsing on the internet . after reading those two articles i did a little more research and decided to try stevia . i found this product at our local kroger store where it happened to be on sale . kroger carries two ro three other stevia based products however after comparing the list of ingredients for each i decided to buy the stevia in the raw . the list of ingredients for the packet form of this product is dextrose and stevia extract ( rebiana ) . ok , i tired it and it tastes great in everyhting i have used it with but i was curious . the stevia extract is supposed to be 200 to 400 times more intensely sweet than sugar . if that is the case why was dextrose used and why was it the more prevalent ingredient ? i called the company on their 800 and asked this same question . the answer is ( according to them ) that dextrose is a carbohydrate derived from crushed corn . it is a filler in their product . the rebiana is so intensely sweet that it was impractical to package it in its pure form in individual packets . the volume would be so small that consumers would wonder if anything was really there . to me this sounds plausible . i am not a dietician , a doctor nor do i work for the company . i simply use their product and like it . i hope this info is helpful . everyone have a gret day out there .

reviewing my previous statement the product i received is completely different from the one i ordered , the quality is extremely poor for its price . i do not recommend this product . that was my previous statement due to the fact that for mother's day the provider that flowers . com used had sent an extremely poor bouquet that seemed was thrown together at the last minute . i did take a picture and sent it through amazon and was delivered 2 days later an adequate bouquet just like the picture . i was very happy with the second vase full of flowers and for this i would recommend it but my husband was very unhappy with the fact that on mother's day he had to hand me the previous mess that was sent . try to not take on more orders than you can correctly deliver because that is when the name and quality of your company gets damaged . all in all the final vase that arrived was beautiful and hopefully they will keep true to the picture portrayed .

not round ? but dogs seem to love them . if you mistakenly think these are round , they are not . my wife put them in my cart , told me they were treat balls that we could leave in the yard for the pups to play with . . . or not , lol . the dogs do , at least , seem to enjoy them , one won't let me get within ten feet of him . i don't think i would trust leaving the treat holder around them , so i guess it's just not a treat for me to give my dogs in the future . but , again , to each their own .

not too much lime taste but not bad there is a faint lime taste to this popcorn , but it is a very weak flavor . the popcorn does taste good , but it's not quite what i was expecting . whether i buy this product again or not will probably depend on how well other people like it . there are other flavors that i like more .

terrible new formula i tried the new formula other day and its terrible . i tried two days in a row and its like someone poured a box of fake sugar sweetener on the cereal and not a good kind . i had the worst after taste for hours even after i brushed my teeth . anyway i emailed them and complained and asked why fiber was reduced to . i told them i would be taking it back to the store and buying a different cereal now . i am so disappointed . here is the email response i got from them below . and there was no coupons attached either . whatever . i'm happy to hear you've enjoyed them for many years ! thank you for your comments regarding kellogg's special k low carb lifestyle protein plus cereal . we are sorry you did not enjoy the reformulated product . as you might imagine , we conduct extensive consumer tests to determine consumer acceptance before introducing a food into the national market . reformulated products are of special concern to us , so we use panels of regular product users across the country to ensure acceptability . tests on this reformulated product showed that most consumers preferred the new product to the old . however , we realize that taste preferences do differ and can certainly understand your feelings . i've compiled a list of cereals with high fiber counts . you may wish to try : kellogg's fiberplus berry yogurt crunch cerealkellogg's fiberplus caramel pecan crunch cerealkellogg's all - bran original cereal & lt ; br > kell ogg's all - bran bran buds cerealwe appreciate your comments and will share them with the appropriate company officials . we have enclosed some coupons which we hope you will use to purchase other products that you enjoy . thank you again for sharing your thoughts ! sincerely , ruben r . consumer specialistconsumer affairstlxrxr01 / cl025968680a

not working for us anymore my cat has been eating this brand for about a year with no issues . ever since they changed the kibble shape , my cat has been vomiting after his meals . i'm guessing they must have changed more than just the kibble shape because something is not agreeing with him . i have been trying to figure out what else could be the issue . he is very healthy and i see no other changes in him . he is still his very energetic self which makes me think no health issues are to blame . i've changed his food and so for no vomiting .

tastes like saccharin i'm trying to wean off splenda and decided to give truvia a shot . perhaps truvia is healthier and more natural , but the taste ruins my coffee . it has a slight saccharin taste which i can't stand . i'm going to try a few other stevia - based sweeteners with the hopes of finding something without an aftertaste . edit : just tried truvia and there's no comparison - truvia wins , hands down . it's much more similar to sugar , in both taste and texture . it's more expensive but well worth the cost .

not enough mint flavor , overly sweet and cloying i'm a big fan of mojitos . they're one of my " go - to " cocktails when i'm out and about . as such , i admit that i'm a bit of a mojito snob . i hate when a bar tries to pass off rum and lemon - lime soda with a sprig of mint as a mojito ; i call that a faux - ito . however , trying to keep the ingredients for a good mojito fresh at home is a challenge , so i was excited to try the new crystal light mocktails mojito mix . one thing that surprised me right away was that the instructions do not provide ratios for using this mix with alcohol . they only provide the non - alcoholic instructions . given this , i decided to try both alcoholic and non - alcoholic variations . for the alcoholic mojitos , i used a ratio of 1 750ml bottle ( roughly 3 / 4 of a quart ) of rum added to a 2 quart pitcher filled 3 / 4 with ice . then i added the mix and water to fill the rest of the way and used a stick blender to mix . for the non - alcoholic mojitos , i used the ratios specified on the package , again using the stick blender to mix it thoroughly . in both variants , i found the mix to be overly sweet and artificially tart tasting . it reminded me of a sweet / sour hard candy . i could not detect the mint at all . if it was there , it was overpowered by the other flavors . considering that the muddled mint is what truly differentiates a mojito from other beverages , that was disappointing . while the alcoholic variant cut the sweetness slightly , it was still overpowering . i was not able to finish the glass i poured myself of either concoction . ( note : regarding the sweetness , i've generally had this opinion of other crystal light mixes . if you're familiar with the brand , i'd say this is on par with their usual sweetness at the recommended ratio on the packaging . ) i decided to go away from their recommended ratios and do my own variants . i eventually settled on using 1 quart of seltzer water with either the rum and ice ( alcoholic ) or regular water ( non - alcoholic ) for one packet . using seltzer instead gave the concoction a nice fizz , but admittedly , it did also remind me too much of those faux - itos at mass market establishments . you could get the same effect by simply using diet lemon lime soda , e . g . , sprite , and muddled mint . ( actually , that will probably come out better because the mint will come through . ) overall , i can't see myself buying this again . i'd rather make the real thing or simply have a different cocktail instead . this feels like a poor attempt to cash in on the mojito trend .

boo i say , tabasco lies . first off , allow me quote the label . " tabasco habanero sauce is made from the world's hottest pepper . " what ? ! that's funny , i don't see the word 'jolokia' nor 'scorpion' anywhere in the ingredients . how is it legal to make such a blatantly false claim ? false advertising aside , i bought a bottle for thirty - five cents at my local grocer after it was on sale and had a coupon which doubled . the moment came and i shook the bottle into my mouth for a swig . . and . . . nothing . minutes later , another big swig ; a third of the bottle now gone . i waited patiently to no avail . maybe others would have been impressed with the hint of capsaicin , but not me . so , thankfully i didn't pay much for this tiny bottle of disappointment . yes , i am a shu snob , and if you need to look up what " shu " is then this sauce is for you . even tabasco's website , which doesn't require a recall to correct , is loaded with inaccurate [ read deceitful ] claims . i've had hotter jalapenos from domino's pizza than tabasco's attempt at a habanero sauce . stick with the simple pickled red pepper juice and market your black pepper water toward the mainstream tabasco ; you're way out of your league . that said , this sauce is great for adding to baking soda and making cool volcanos with my kids . certainly not worthy of gracing my breakfast . but hey , this is just my opinion . much like tabasco's opinion on " the world's hottest pepper " ; no real merit . worth noting , this is only the second time i've ever been compelled enough by a product to take the time which i have little of to share my opinion .

too tough ? hey , it's jerky ! although i was a little put off by a prior review that indicated this product was nearly inedible , we had purchased this salmon jerky at trader joe's in smaller packets and really liked it , so we decided to purchase here at amazon much less expensively . yes , this product is very dry , but it also has none of the preservatives included in some of the more moist jerky products out there . my family liked it , and we are placing a second order . that other reviewer should send her inedible seven extra packages our way !

total ripoff ( and mistake on my review ) see my last post before reading . i wanted to cook a gumbo that called for a tablespoon of file powder . never having heard of this spice i , i looked all over my town and could not find it in any spice sections of the local stores , so i ordered here at amazon for $ 11 . 95 the next day when i was at the local fish market i found the same sized jar for $ 2 . 50 . never having used the spice , i have no comment on its quality , but this is way overpriced . if you can't find this spice locally , do a internet search to find another seller . this should not be this expensive . 
=================
i guess taste really is subjective i really like this zico flavor and was shocked to see so many bad reviews . taste is subjective though , so to each his own . i like how it has a mild citrus taste without any bitterness , i did not find it sour - - maybe i just got a good batch ? it is delicious mixed with 4 ounces of orange juice ! other things i like are gin and tonics , crystal geyser lime flavored unsweetened seltzer , real margaritas , and just a slice of lemon in ice water ; i felt this coconut water did not taste like any of these in particular , but was in the same family with these flavors . since this is a love or hate flavor , i suggest buying one from a store and trying it out before investing in a case .

read the fine print on the box of quinoa ancient harvest supergrain pasta while this pasta tastes better than many whole grain pastas , i am giving a ranking of 2 because although the packaging strongly suggests this product contains a significant amount of quinoa , the actual amount of quinoa in the corn - quinoa blend may be just slightly greater than the amount of dried spinach needed to color a few of the pieces green . so don't have your decision swayed by the side or back panels , which detail the wonderful nutritional profile of quinoa and its history of cultivation . note that the company's website states " our corn / quinoa gluten free pasta is primarily a corn based product . " so maybe they should be putting the word " corn " in the big print ?

difficult to use . this came in 2 pretty big jars . i opened one and it was completely white . after a week or so of using it , i saw small black patches of what looked like mold on the surface of the surface . so i scraped it off . but within a couple of days , it grew back . i thought it was disgusting . didn't want to throw such expensive oil away though . so i refrigerated it . when refrigerated , the oil is hard as a brick . it's really difficult to scrape out chucks for use . i mostly use this for pan frying eggs , veggies , meats , toast , etc .

a lot of money for what you're getting . . . . . while these are a nice cool treat for your dog , it's much more economical to make your own . these containers are super small . just mix together some plain yogurt , ripe bananas , blueberries , peanut butter and whatever else your dog likes , and you can make a lot of treats for the same money as this tiny bit . 
=================
excellent product - bad amazon service my dog loves this treat . however , amazon carries close to expiry products and my 1st order & its replacement were both expired on arrival . i am still waiting for the credit to my account for the expired goods a year later ! ( something to do with multiple returns on the same order & their computer system can't handle it ) the treat is supposed to be semi - soft & chewy not hard . if it is hard & tough , it's been stored improperly or has expired . i will continue buying this treat , but not from amazon .

be aware , this came as be aware , this came as a single box . i thought i was buying a 6 pack for that high price . i love the tea , but buy it straight from twinings if you have to pay this price .

not very strong on the bergamot scent one of the reasons why i love early grey tea is the scent of bergamot oil and the strong black tea flavor . this tea , was no earl grey . it was more like assam , with a hint of bergamot oil . if you like earl grey , i suggest you try mariage fr & egrave ; res french blue earl grey or adagio's earl grey . if you like organic , try mighty leaf .

great in moderation aunt jemima's original maple syrup , this is in all meanings of the word a " silf . " i never thought you could have too much of a good thing , until i was dared to chug 3 bottles of aunt jemima's original maple syrup . i took that bet before i knew you . . . before i knew myself . i was only able to down one . the days following were the worst of my life . i lost the bet , i lost my self respect , and i lost my girlfriend . was it worth it ? no . would i do it again ? if the price was right . a fearless man is far more dangerous than any coward , but even i wouldn't buy used syrup .

hmm ok i think i taste more of the mango then the peach but over all i like the vita coco water with flavors then just by itself . i am not in the food science world but i think coconut water is made by taking the coconut milk and separating the cream / solids from the water part . what is left is a strong coconut flavored past that is sent somewhere else and coconut water that still has health effects and a very slight coconut flavor . it also has some weight , or thickness that is heaver then what normal water would be , it reminds me of an egg white viscosity . drink it colder the better i say because when warm urp !

great pistachios , terrible packing i received this bag broken , the pistachios were all over the box , i contacted amazon to return them to get a refund to then order them again , but since i left them open in our kitchen table my partner came and started eating them , by the time i noticed she had about a cup of them so i felt i couldn't return them . the box was in good condition so the damage was not in transit , i am not sure how the bag was so broken but the only explanation was that it happened while they packed them . on another note , my partmner didn't get sick from eating them but we didn't want to take a bigger chance . i do like this brand since i ordered the smaller bag before and that is why we decided to get the bigger one . 
=================
qaulity dog food this is a quality dog food . it's high in protein and has a variety of ingredients , none of which caused me to say " what in the world is that ? " . unfortunately for me , though , it turns out that my puppy has sensitivity to gluten , and barley is the 3rd ingredient listed for this food . i'd recommend this food for someone who wants a high - quality food for their puppy , but doesn't need grain - free . if your dog gets incredibly gassy and has strong smelling , soft poop or loose stools when eating this , i'd suggest switching to completely gluten - free dog food .

tastes of molasses a little . the taste although very sweet is closer to a molasses taste than other grade b maple syrups in my opinion .

don't buy unless you will use within a few days ! faulty packaging the packaging is faulty and allows moisture into the cereal . i retained all packs in a safe , dry area ( we do live in a moist area though ) . when opened packs to use , they were all so hard & stuck together from getting moist , you could barely even get teh cereal out of the box much less giving it to a baby probably wouldn't be a good idea . 
=================
sorry for breaking the perfect record i was gonna give it a three , but i ate 2 more of them before i wrote my review and the second changed my mind . the image shown on the box is very misleading i must say . the actual chocolate looks dry and has a chalky texture . the taste is pretty good , but after reading the exuberant reviews it got , i was really disappointed . it's chocolate with nuts - fine , but it just didn't met my expectations . i bought some hersheys chocolates at the same time that was much cheaper and had much more content and honestly i enjoyed the hersheys much more . that is only emphasized by the fact that the hersheys are all gone and i haven't even completed half this box . good chocolate , but nothing that special .

all dented up - its true i'm cancelling my subscription to these as the come all beat to hell . not from shipping , the cans in the middle of the 12 pack flat were the most damaged . drank them this time anyway though . i also found a store that sells blue monkey for less than the subscription price . 
=================
be very careful of price ! ! most stores are selling this for about $ 4 . 70ish . one seller on amazon was selling for $ 13 . 00 a bag : $ 79 for a pack of 6 . no way ! ! 4 . 70 x 6 should be 28 . 20 . don't over spend on this yummy product !

good , but no cigar . . . i enjoy this coffee mixed half and half with my preferred non - flavored variety , where it adds a hint of excitement and indulgence to an otherwise ordinary cup , but i have found that i prefer not to drink it alone as i am generally disappointed . it is good , but doesn't have the bold flavor and depth of other chocolate raspberry coffees i have tried . also , the grind is almost too fine and tends to 'clog' the filter when i brew more than half a pot .

not bad i was hoping to find an english breakfast that is not too heavy and has the kemun flavors . tea was good qualtiy but seemed to lack something . i cannot tell if it was the kemun . i wish tea makers would tell you what the dang mixture is so we do not have to guess so much .

got to go all out first slice i wasnt too impressed . . . what's up with all this hype ? figured , i'll go with the recommendation as i had ice cream on hand . . . popped a slice in the microwave for 20 secs , added a few scoops of ice cream . . . and omg it was like another cake ! you got to nuke it !

tastes good but definitely not like espresso my husband and i tried this red espresso tea and have had mixed reviews . initially he thought it was great and i thought it was not - so - great , and now we he would give it a three while i would give it a five , so i split the difference for the four stars . initially i expected this drink to have a taste in the vicinity of espresso . it does not taste like espresso at all and it did not taste like tea either . we prepared the tea per the package directions of using a cappucino machine and adding steamed , frothed milk and some honey . all subsequent times we flavored by using plain sugar instead of honey and i thought that was better . the taste of this drink grew on me over time . while it was a nice drink , the product is pricey and i probably wouldn't buy it again .

beware - amazon limits the total amount you can buy the food is great . the cats have gotten completely addicted to it . but . . . . what amazon doesn't bother to mention is that " quantities are limited " . i have been buying this food for my 3 cats for about 6 months . it comprises roughly half their diet ( or 3 cats / day ) . i just went to re - order and was repeatedly told " there's a problem " . long story , and 2 phone calls plus 2 emails later , i was told i have bought the lifetime maximum of this product . i ordered it for almost twice the price via the marketplace , but i am furious with amazon . nowhere on this page do they tell you there's a limit . so i'm here to tell you there is . the food is great , but don't get used to buying it here .

save your money as per instructions , i cleaned up the cat waste in the area , then sprinkled scram cat . in 2 days the feral cats in my neighborhood were using the area as a litterbox again ! if it rains , you need to reapply . the stuff has a decent odor . the bag doesn't go that far . i'd love to give the bill for this bag and all the other methods i've tried to the neighbor who started feeding a couple of stray cats . the population is probably at least 30 now .

a must for canned pet food my dog recently was switched from dry dog food , to canned by my vet . i tried saran wrap / foil / you name it . but i felt the air was getting intothe can ; and my dog was essentially eating stale food after the firstportion . these lids are awesome . they are very heavy duty ; so i know they will last , & stand up to being washed & pulled on & off continually . they have an easy pulltab for anyone having difficulty opening containers . then snap right back on . i feel confident now , that my beloved dog , isn't eating stale , crusty food .

love the product . alert ! nagging question ahead . i'm grateful to lakewood for their noni juice . but i'm mystified as to why the change in serving size . first , let me tell you why i like the product . in the fall of last year i was , inadvertently , causing heart palpitations due to the fact that i was doing shoulder stands as part of my yoga routine . i stopped the shoulder stands , and my heart returned to normal in about a week . but i was rundown and tired from two months of heart palpitations . so i picked up a bottle of noni . i took the recommended serving , 1 tsp . per day . i felt nothing for two weeks . and then the noni kicked in . i felt noticeably better every single day . today ( and for months now ) i feel great . now , here's where things get interesting . the bottle i bought six months ago says serving size is 1 tsp . ( 5 ml ) ; servings per container is listed as 190 . obviously , shelling out $ 25 every six months or so is no big deal for most of us . now , if you look at the label on the newer shipment of noni , you'll see a change in the serving size - 2 fl oz ( 4 tbsp ) ; servings per container 16 . yikes ! twenty - five dollars for a 16 - day supply . so i contacted the company on june 9 with my question - why the change in serving size ? i'm still waiting for a reply .

very good value for organic treats - good for your pupper these are very inexpensive at this site because they are usually twice the price in all the typical pet stores you usually go to . they are an awesome deal for organic . i try to feed my dog only organic food and treats as close to all organic as i can . i had a dog that was very young , 2 1 / 2 , and he died from cancer and ever since then , i have been very cautious of what i feed my dog now . organic does make the difference and these treats are low in calories so they are a good treat to give your dog if you are trying to control his weight . you don't have to feel guility giving him / her these treats , they are small and as i mentioned low calorie . i would reccomend these to any dog owner and i have also purchased the chicken , duck and salmon treats made by plato , all good choices . the salmon ones are very very stinky though , beware of those , good for your dog though , lots of omega 3's in them .

saved by another reviewer baking soda is amazing stuff . so , i almost bought this , in my head picturing the 4 lb box . then i saw a complaint by another reviewer about how very small the box is and realized that i was making the same mistake as that amazon reviewer ! thanks , helpful stranger ! ! i cancelled the order : the price was way , way too high for the same regular sized box available for much cheaper in the departments stores around here . but , i did later buy a bunch of these little 1 lb boxes in bulk elsewhere online . a box of this does wonders for my gym locker , and a larger box would not have fit . i also like to keep a little box in the kitchen for dishes in need of hand washing that have an unpleasant odor for some reason . 
=================
flat i love several of the other santa cruz organic sodas ( lemon / lime & pomegranate / lime are awesome ) , but i don't care for this one at all . it has a root beer flavor , but something isn't right about it . it has lemon juice in it which seems odd to me , but i think the biggest problem is the low amount of carbonation . even a freshly cooled can tastes like it's been left open all day and then put back in the refridge . the less carbonation works great in their fruity drinks , but not this one . also , at a 130 calories per can , you will not get skinny drinking this stuff . 
=================
no more moths ! ! ! these traps are amazing . we put the box containing the scent ( not noticable ) and sticky paper on a top shelf , and left it . when i checked it several days later there were moths caught on the sticky paper . they are attracted by the scent , and i have seen no more moths flying around . 
=================
amazon sent wrong item again amazon sent the peach flavor not the cola flavor beware . too much hassle to send them back for less than $ 20 but what a pain the crappy quality control in the warehouse is . peach flavor is pretty tasty but not what i ordered . 
=================
tastes much better than expected . i don't like most drinks with artificial sweeteners , so my expectations were not very high for the mio mango peach , which contains sucralose . i must say , i was very pleasantly surprised . when i added it to my filtered water ( filtered with 3m filtrete water station it had the thirst - quenching qualities of plain water , and it tasted lightly of real mango and peach . it didn't taste artificial , and it wasn't too sweet unless i accidentally added too much mio to my water . when that happens , i merely add a bit more water . because of the sucralose , i won't buy this often , but i will definitely buy it occasionally . amazon doesn't list the ingredients . here they are : water , malic acid , propylene glycol , citric acid , contains less than 22 % of flavor ( s ) natural , sucralose and acesulfame potassium sweetener , potassium citrate , yellow 5 , yellow 6 , red 40 , potassium sorbate preservative . definitely not a health drink , but tasty enough that i don't care . 
=================
great milk but horribly overpriced i always purchase this milk for my son's lunch - he loves it , but how can you really go wrong with chocolate milk ? ! my only complaint is that this product is horribly overpriced on amazon . i purchase the exact same product ( 18 count ) for under $ 12 at costco . plus if you factor in shipping cost - - yikes , you could easily spend $ 3 for each little box . before you do that , i would suggest buying organic milk at the grocery and adding a dollop of hershey's syrup . 
=================
worked better then other trap length : : 0 : 17 minswas curious to find out which product was superior so i tested two different traps in 2 separate infested areas ( to keep it as neutral as possible ) and counted the amount of moths trapped . this 'video' shows the results of this test . i thought it was pretty alarming and telling to the quality of this particular trap .

picture does not match package ! i was disappointed when i received the package of freeze - dried zucchini because it is smaller than pictured ( by about one - half ) and there are no directions how to reconstitute or ideas for use . 
=================
colavita olive oil i use this brand all the time for cooking , just like lydia on tv . even after paying postage it was cheaper than buying it locally . you can buy cheaper olive oil but you get what you pay for . 
=================
so disappointed they no longer are making this exact coffee ! this beats every other hazelnut k cup out there now the company has changed the formula and are calling the new hazelnut " vanilla hazelnut " . its good , just ok but not as full bodied as this . if you get the chance ( and i don't see it first ) order the original . its so worth it ! 
=================
my cat's favorite flavor it is hard to get just one falvor of this product . i was very happy to order 48 pouches . however , when they arrived the out side of the box label was turkey in gravy but they contained mixed grill instead . i could not return but amazon gave me a total refund . if you are ordering this , wait about 10 days ( after 9 / 1 / 12 ) so you don't receive mixed grill like i did . it was labeled wrong from the factory so it will take them a while to get new shippments . 
=================
be aware of packaging ! ! i had ordered the spaghetti & it was wonderful , so i ordered the pasta . i knew it was coming in a " bulk " order , but i didn't expect it just thrown in a box ! it comes in a large cardboard shipping box . when i opened it , there was a flimsy plastic bag with the 10 lbs of pasta . no advertising , no individual boxes . the bag was ripped in several places and the pasta fell all over like those annoying packaging peanuts ! i like the product , but i just didn't know i was going to have to find several storage bags to keep it in . just be aware ! 
=================
good price for green tea , 4 bags per foiled pouch i'm trying so hard to drink green tea for health benefits . had a bigelo 20 bag box , individually foil packed , and bought this bulk pack to save money . this huge pack contains 4 bags per foil , for freshness . price was far better than bigelo site , or others online , so bought it . found them in sam's club cheaper the next week . each tea bag is designed as one upright sack - - different from the folded / split bags in my previous bigelo 20 bag box . these tend to float and require more effort to disperse compared to the previous bags with twice the surface area , in folded pouch design . it is what it is . to me , green tea is about the most disgusting tasting thing i've ever had , and i hope it grows on me because this is an exercise in sheer discipline . i just hate green tea , but can't fault this product for that . entire family hates the smell of it , and loathes any taste of it . i hope it is an acquired taste . . . this is straight green tea w / no sweetener or mitigating flavors .

healthy way to stay fit kelloggs special k red berries is what i have for breakfast for at least 4 years now and i lost weight and stay fit . i have it with milk and so when i need midnight snack i go for it , too . 
=================
tastes ok but . . . i like the fact that this product is all organic and tastes ok but is very salty . if you use this product , you pretty much can't add anymore salt to your dish . i prefer the taste of seitenbacher's vegetable broth powder over this - it has more flavor and is far less salty . don't get me wrong , this is a fine product but if you want more flavor , less salt , go for seitenbacher ( i wrote a more in depth review on that product's page ) . 
=================
oops ya thats right , oops , not my cup of tea , not enough flavor to suit me . but it is quick and easy in a pinch . sorry
=================
quality going down hill each bag i've received has gotten drier and less appealing . the last bag i received was mostly crunchy , so after a call to navitas , they sent me a replacement of another item . i've been ordering another brand that is pesticide free and about as juicy as rasins - i love them ! i still love navitas' chocolate products . 
=================
irritant this milk tastes good , but contains carageenan which is a cellular irritant . carageenan is suspected to be implicated in colon cancer , and possibly other cancers since it irritates other than gi tissue . the same company has a carageenan - free version , called rice dream , original , classic . it's a great alternative to this one . not quite as thick , but otherwise tastes the same . 
=================
may taste delicious , but now comes from china polar jarred fruits used to come from mexico . they are now coming from china . i can attest that these strawberries do taste very delicious , but i am concerned that chinese regulation is still weak , and that pesticides and hormones are being overused on a large scale ( see the story on exploding watermelons from 2011 ) . i have also noticed that when they started coming from china , the price dropped ; something wrong with a product being shipped all the way across the pacific , and being cheaper than coming across a land border from mexico . 
=================
the original is available i've always avoided the lea & perrins brand due to using hfcs but today i was in the store and i was happy to find lea & perrins " all natural " it uses sugar instead . seek it out if you want the true original . 
=================
doubled the price i bought this last month 12 bottles for 13 . 95 and now this month it is 21 . 00 . why did you double the price . its good , but not worth 2 . 00 a bottle . i understand price goes up 10 % but 100 % . . . this is not good . won'tbe buying you tea again at this price . 
=================
very little flavor , i was disappointed you'd think you can't go wrong with a basic staple like rice , right ? unfortunately , i was disappointed with this rice . lotus foods madagascar pink rice was described as having a hint of spice flavor such as cinnamon or clove . i didn't pick up on that in the slightest . in fact , this rice had very little flavor at all . i normally buy brown basmati rice , or lotus foods forbidden rice which are fantastic all by themselves . those rices can be enjoyed without a speck of salt or other seasoning added . the madagascar pink can't begin to compare . i wish this had been available in a small package instead of an 11 pound sack . i read the full description on the lotus foods website and i liked the idea of this rice . the amazon subscription price was a great deal , so i went for it . i'll still eat the rice , of course , but it will be served in recipes that don't depend on the rice for flavor like other whole grain rices provide . 
=================
not good food i had my dog on this food until he developed an infection in his anal glands . my vet told me not to use this food anymore because it is made in china and the glucosamine in the happy hips formula provides no benefit to my dog because the amount of glucosamine is too small and its not a high quality . he had us switch to royal caninroyal canin dry dog food , giant breed adult 28 formula , 35 - pound bag - so far our dog is doing really well with this food , firmer stool , loves to eat it , etc . and for the glucosamine / chondroitin / msm we are using dasaquinnutramax dasuquin with msm for large dogs - 150 tablets which is a pharmaceutical grade supplement , same manufactorer makes a supplement for human consumption as well . do yourself a favor - buy a solid supplement and a dog food that is not produced in china . 
=================
well it's better than the black cherry anyway this is my second can of " the switch " that i'm reviewing under the amazon vine program . and while this one is perhaps a bit better it still has the same basic issues - - it's over priced at almost $ 1 for a mere 8 . 3oz can in a 24 pack , but more importantly it really just doesn't taste like orange or tangerine at all . the ingredients actually list apple juice as the first type . now why would you put apple juice in an orange drink ? now don't get me wrong , it tastes exactly like one would expect carbonated juice to taste . . . but the flavor isn't all that appealing . i love orange juice , drink it every day . i'd love to try carbonated orange juice . . . but this is far from that . it might be a good substitute for normal soda for kids , but i can't imagine any other real reason to get this . 
=================
problem cider had a great taste and i was so happy to be able to purchase sugar - free k - cups . . . however , when i opened the box , two of the cups had puncture marks already in them , rendering them unusable . i took my chances and used the rest of the k - cups ( after inspecting them ) but was upset , knowing that this product i had purchased had been tampered with .

burgess seed co . dba directgardening . com i highly recommend folks avoid burgess seed and directgardening . com at all costs ! they have been charging orders on credit cards and not filling them ! ! ! they send form letters to avoid refunds and you get the " talk to the hand " if you get through to their poor customer service . there are so many complaints against them and we for one are filing with the better business bureau - 
=================
taste is fantastic , " single serve " package needs improvement . the coffee is great . strong flavor , strong aroma . sumatra is one of my single favorite flavors as black coffee , and ekojava doesn't disappoint as far as taste is concerned . 5 / 5 stars for the coffee . these are marketed along with the ekobrew k - cup replacement , which is how i have been using them . the thing is - these " single serve packets " don't fit into the ekobrew k - cup - there is too much coffee . there is no practical way to " save " the remaining grounds for use another time / day . i don't drink the same flavor every day , so it would be a few days before i rotate back to this flavor , and then i'd have to open another package to even out the amount - leaving me with another partial package . unpractical to say the least . i bought this to save time and flavor ( after exposure to air , the flavor becomes less potent . ) and i'm not really saving either . i spend more time trying to tap out the proper amount of grinds to fit into the ecobrew , and then the package is open , so the leftovers aren't as rich as the first brew . package review would be 2 stars out of 5 - the functionality of it is there , but the sizing needs a major improvement to be practical for what it's marketed as . in summary : taste is great , package size leaves a lot to be desired . 4 / 5 total . 
=================
really runny and virtually tasteless - - but hey , better than nothing on my high protein waffles i enjoy the nature's hollow jam / preserves so much - - am having some right now between typing , the blueberry over fage yogurt , and it's so good - - that i figured i'd give the sugar - free syrup a try . um . not so great . i made high protein waffles and i usually use either natural applesauce , a homemade berry compote , or smucker's sugar free breakfast syrup on these babies . today , i chopped up strawberries and used this syrup . so disappointing . the flavor is slight , slight . a hint of mapleness . the sweetness is okay . the texture is watery . now , i can live with a ightweight , watery texture if you pump up the flavor . : ) but this one , not so much . for now , i'll stick to my smucker's sugar - free ( though it's not perfect , it's been the tastiest fake maple syrup that has a genuine thick consistency ) . or , occasionally , i just cave and have real maple syrup . ( i'm not on a low - carb diet , i just try to avoid sugar when possible . ) i think this may serve better to use in fruit mixtures to then top waffles or pancakes or to flavor plain oatmeal . this syrup will sweeten stuff up with a light maple flavor , and while it was kind of a fail on my waffles , i can see that this might work better to flavor my slow - cooked oatmeal . that's why this gets 2 stars instead of 1 star : whilte it failed for me as a good syrup for pancakes and waffles , i suspect it will be good as a maple flavoring agent . and this one is way better than the maple grove farms one and the davinci one . for low - carbers , worth trying , even if not very satisfying substitute for the real thing . i hope nature's hollow reformulates the syrup adding more maple flavor and thickening it up a bit . i'd retry their product if they did . 
=================
ok the gum is ok . the taste last for about a minute so one has to keep popping new pieces into mouth . it is also very sticky once it is taken out from mouth . but it doesn't contain all that bad stuff that other gums have . 
=================
price keeps increasing . . . i have enjoyed this product for quite some time . however , i am disgusted by the fact that the price keeps increasing ! at $ 35 per case , customers are paying more than $ 4 per box for 5 small cookie bars - ridiculous ! i will find a healthier , more reasonably priced snack to munch on . shame on nana and amazon . . . 
=================
not quite big enough , can't get parts works well enough , but needs to hold about 10 % more so you can actually get a whole pound of meat into it including the inevitable air pockets . also , i needed to replace one of the nozzles ( damaged in the dishwasher ) and the part at the end of the plunger that pushes the meat out . unfortunately , replacement parts are not available for this item . 
=================
just a saltier original flavor this is no different from the original flavor except it is much saltier . so if you think the original in underflavored try this flavor . also , for those with allergies to seafood and shell fish this product should be safe because the flavor is artificial . 
=================
clear coffee flavor all coffee flavor , unlike the other weird tasting non - caffeinated coffees . i hate the " acidic taste " that most others have . try it and you'll see what you have been missing . 
=================
actually . . . i think this stuff is pretty good . i've had a few bags and have noticed that the " toughness " varies wildly from bag to bag . the thing is , just about all of the other turkey jerky i've ever had tastes amazingly fake and rubbery . this , while potentially tough , just tastes good . i used to get it at trader joe's , but they've since replaced it with their own store - label line . . . it's horrible . just horrible . so now i turn to amazong . . . 
=================
loved at first , but ingredients are not natural ! when i first saw this product i thought , great , all natural coconut and shea butter . it's the latest rave and so good for you . this product also smells so deliciously wonderful , like a coconut / pineapple tropical delight ! i really like how it feels on my long frizzy hair and makes it so shiney and smooth . wonderful stuff ! ! ! once i really looked into the ingredients , i was horrified ! i've been really looking at ingredients closely these days and did the same with this product . first ingredient mineral oil . not the greatest stuff since is it a by - product of distillation of gasoline and considered a carcinogenic by some people . second , hydrogenated coconut oil . what does that mean ? i know coconut oil in it's raw form is really good in our diets and on our skin . after some google research i found out that hydrogentated coconut oil is created by heating to 500 - 1000 degrees , then a catalyst is injected . the catalyst is typically nickel , platinum , or even aluminum ! this stuff is bad for you ! it is closer to plastic than a good for you organic compound . sure , you're not putting it in your body , but there is some absorption that takes place when you squeeze it in your hands and through you scalp . third ingredient , even worse ! styrene butadiene copolymer . labeled as bht and most people don't notice this ingredient or even think anything of it . it's synthetic rubber used in car tires , yuck ! embalming fluid , even more yuck ! it has been associated to child hyper - activity and cancer . i just can't give this item a good review . it's not even gluten free since it has wheat germ oil . other ingredients are good , like sweet almond oil and aloe . this product feels really nice in my hair and i will use in on an occassional basis , but not on a daily basis . i have found plain shea butter or coconut oil in raw form is the very best thing for my dry , frizzy hair . 
=================
salt . . . if it's so bad , why do salt tablets exist . . . . i do lots of muscle testing . . . and found that la baleine salt consistently tests better for people than any other salt . . . celtic salt can test well . . . but is not always a good product . . . there is the theory that vets give cows salt licks as farmers have to keep their cattle healthy . . . they can't afford lots of medicines . . . books like your body's many cries for water . . . also talk about salt . . . regular grocery store brands and most health food store brands test weak on people . . . keep your health balanced with lots of water and enough salt . . . the right salt . . . 
=================
keurig k - cups sampler gift pack i was disappointed with this sampler pack because i thought it would have a lot more flavored decaf ups than it does . i thought when i ordered it , it did , so , when i received it and opened the box , i was very disappointed . if you want a lot of dark roasted decaf cups than this is the pack to get . if , however you're like me and wanting to try out flavored k - ups , then you'll be sadly disappointed . 
=================
great product , terrible packaging . . . beware . . . no complaints about the chips , they're great . however the box arrived from ups half open and when i opened it completely , i found one chip bag had exploded and all the other 23 bags were crushed or semi - crushed . so much for that ! not blaming amazon or ups but next time this happens , i will return the order . 
=================
tasty but way too salty ! i purchased this when it was a lightning deal last week . i love indian food and was excited to try this . it's tasty and easy to prepare . however , it is very salty ! the label says there are 480mg of sodium in 1 / 4 of the package ( which translates to 20 % of the recommended daily value ) . the next time i make this i'll have to add more than the 1 cup of water that's in the instructions . i also ended up adding about 1 / 2 cup of yogurt to take down the heat of the spices . i don't normally have a problem with spicy foods , but i felt this curry was more on the hot side despite what other reviewers said . 
=================
be careful or you will get fat - or fatter : - ) this is not a health food ; but i probably didn't need to tell you that . the first ingredient is sugar and the second is palm oil . i just received and openedthis treat and had my first cookie . if you like reese's peanut butter cups ( who doesn't ? ) , you will probably like these . they taste almost exactly like areese's but are shaped like a cookie and have a thin cookie crust on the bottom . so , to describe it , it's a cookie crust bottom with peanutbutter on top , then the entire cookie / product is covered in like a dipped chocolate similar to what you'd get if you went to dairy queen and had your vanillssoft - serve cone dipped in chocolate . they use the word " fudge " on the packaging but i personally would not claim that they have a fudge - like taste . betcha can't eat just one - lol

you know what i haven't had in a while ? big league chew . true story : i was addicted to big league chew . almost destroyed my life until i checked myself into the clinic . what a reality - check . the therapist slapped me in the face for even thinking of kicking my big league chew habit . the product description reads , " target consumer : boys 6 - 12 with an active interest in baseball " but declines to mention the rock - star status one receives upon bringing a box of big league chew to work . since i brought the box to work this morning , i've since been promoted nine times , from mail - room drone to executive director of awesome . 
=================
very tasty , but needs more nutritional value sure i love the taste of the sugary sweetness of this cereal . tastes like frosted flakes with honey and nut mixed in . unfortunately , with no ( ok , less than 1 gram ) fiber , they don't provide the nutrition that i need . the nutritional panel is basically carbs . . . 11 of 26 which are sugar . i kept eating , but i never felt full , but i sure did get a ton of empty calories . i can't recommend this to anyone looking to eat a hearty breakfast . if you are looking for corn , sugar , peanuts , and honey ( first four ingredients ) and don't care about nutrition , this cereal is for you . for everyone else , look elsewhere . full ingredients : ( look at all the sugar ) milled corn , sugar , peanuts , honey , malt flavoring , molasses , salt , high fructose corn syrup , caramel color , iron , annatto extract color , niacinamide , ascorbic acid ( vitamin c ) , sodium ascorbate ( vitamin c ) , pyridoxine hydrochloride ( vitamin b6 ) , thiamin hydrochloride ( vitamin b1 ) , riboflavin ( vitamin b2 ) , vitamin a palmitate , vitamin b12 , folic acid , bht ( preservative ) , vitamin d , wheat starch .

5 stars for flavor ; condition upon delivery - mess these add a creamy , thick flavor to almost anything but once in a while i experience a very strange aftertaste with the chocolate flavor , usually when i use 2 vs just one in my beverage . the packaging , however , leaves a lot to be desired and unless you want a lot of work when this arrives , you might want to rethink this purchase . in recent weeks , i've purchased 3 cases of this product ( that is 12 boxes of 50 single serve cups ) in 3 flavors for the local emergency shelter here in western , ma due to the tornadoes that ripped through my community and those of my family and friends . i am so thankful i looked at this product before just bringing it to the make - shift kitchens and coffee setups on the back of pickup trucks . this is what i experienced . what follows is actually my 'cut and paste' comments from one of my 'leave packaging comments' for amazon , so it lists 2 cases vs 3 . i purchased 1 first , then had second thoughts and went back and bought the additional 2 flavors ( creamy chocolate , cinnamon vanilla ( excellent flavor , by the way ) and irish cream ( a bit too subtle in flavor for me - could have a bit more oomph ) . as such , you'll see me refer to just 2 below . exterior shipping box was fine and interior 'case' holding product perfectly intact . however , contents ( 50 in each ) are a sticky , gooey , unusable mess . i purchased 2 flavors / 2 cases = 8 cartons = 400 of this product and all 8 cartons are a disgusting disappointment . while the majority of the single serve cups are fine , a large handful in every one of the 50 - pack boxes are squished , cracked or just ripped open . contents spilled over the rest of the single serve cups throughout the boxes that are now slimy , sticky and tacky , with what looks like dried and / or tacky curdled milk all over them . i had to throw away 46 cups total and wash every other single serve cup by hand and then find another container to hold them all . i sure won't be buying these again . 
=================
don't listen to the other reviews . here is all you need to know . i've read the reviews about it clogging the machine and grounds spilling all over and it's all moot as far as i'm concerned . i too placed my first cup in my cuisinart and had the grounds spill all over . i took out the k cup and found out that it did not puncture a complete hole in the bottom . the next cup i put in i closed a little more forcefully and it punctured a hole just fine . i've been enjoying pretty good coffee ever since . so my friends , just make sure a hole is punctured in the cup . you can even take it out and check and then put it back in . no problems with this k cup so stop worrying about it . 
=================
date stamped on product is mfg date , not expiration i ordered this product on may 2 , 2012 . it arrived as promised and the box had a date stamped on it of feb 14 , 2012 . it did not clarify whether this was the manufacture date or the expiration date . i called amazon and they found a note related to this product indicating that this is the manufacture date and that the product expires 9 months from manufacture . i suggested they update their product description with this information because it can be confusing otherwise . so , it basically leaves me with 6 months to use this product . i doubt i will through 200 packets by then , but it is still much more convenient than finding another container to put a small amount of ketchup for single serving use .

better then the gopher repelling devices i purchased a set ( two ) of these at my local home store for about $ 11 . 00 . i purchased a gopher repelling device which advertised that the gopher would be repelled by the beeping noise . only when i got home and read the packaging did i learn that the device would not repell the gopher for 2 - 3 weeks . my gopher was eating about three plants and herbs a day . doing the math and realizing i would have no plants left in 2 - 3 weeks i purchased these traps . they were a little tricky to set up but once you figure it out it is easy . i set the trap where i knew there had been recent gopher activity . i dug up a mound of dirt and found the tunnels and cleared out the dirt . when the hole was refilled i knew it was active . i took out the dirt and placed the traps in the tunnels as the direction indicated . i checked it an hour later and the gopher was history . not the easiest to empty but you can use a screwdriver to push down on the device to release the gopher .

dogs liked them ok . despite the name , these are not really cupcakes . they're just flat cookies . the sprinkles fall off pretty easily , so be careful to clean up after yourself . on the plus side , our dogs liked them . 
=================
far too expensive i can see why most supermarkets have stopped carrying stoned wheat thins - they have become too expensive to stock . online vendors charging more than $ 5 for a box of crackers - pretty steep . good thing we can still find akmak locally . tj's has some odd brands of crackers that might not cost as much per pound as chicken or pork . 
=================
not as crunchy as the other blue diamond flavors i'm addicted to blue diamond almonds . i've tried all the flavors - - and this was the last one i tried . i love salt , i love vinegar , and i love salt - and - vinegar potato chips , so how could i lose with these ? well , i'm just not that into them . the flavor's great and the almonds are fresh , but somehow the texture just fails . the almonds just seem . . . soggy . they don't have that wonderful crunch that the other blue diamond flavors have . and that flattens out the whole experience of eating them . i've eaten about 10 bags so far , and they all have the same lackluster texture . oh well . guess even my ol' reliable blue diamond can't hit it out of the park every time .

local grocery store may be cheaper i found 4 lb . bags of yellow popcorn from a popular brand available at my local grocery store for $ 3 . 87 / bag . they were even dated to " best sold by 3 / 13' . that comes to under 97 cents a pound . paragon bulk might be pretty good but i can buy 12 pounds locally for $ 11 . 61 which is close to $ 5 . 00 cheaper than listed here of equally good popcorn . sometimes looking around locally is a better buy .

bait and switch these used to be an excellent value but in sept / oct 2011 , seasons changed their can design ( which itself is a good thing because the old cans were difficult to open ) , but they put in less sardines and the sardines are now of an inferior quality . the old can had a printed net weight of 3 . 75 oz , and there were in fact about 3 . 8 oz of sardines in the can . . . 6 - 7 tender , moist yummy sardines . now , in the new cans ( which open from the corner ) , the actual weight of the sardines is about 3 oz . . . almost a 1 / 4 loss of product ( the printed weight is still 3 . 75 oz ) . . . and the price is still the same . what makes it worse is that the sardines are big ( 2 - 3 sardines vs the older 5 - 6 sardines , dry , tough and have an off smell . if you get a can which opens from the top , you're good to go , but if you have the newer can which opens from the corner , you're getting an inferior sardine and paying more for less . another example of an american company sacrificing quality for higher profits .

nutritious but not so delicious . these pretzels have a nice crunch and a lot of nutritional value , but their flavor is very bland . bland with a hint of cinnamon . i wish i'd tried a single bag before buying an entire 12 - bag box , but they're not available in stores ( at least where i live ) and the reviews seemed fairly positive . on the bright side , they do leave you feeling comfortably full for minimal calories . a recommended diet food for those who have the fortitude to place higher priority on protein - dense snacking rather than flavor .

expelling wind ? i bought these in the airport in beijing because i had a sore throat and was about to board a 14 - hour flight home . they work ! and taste pretty good too . but in the product features section it lists " expelling wind " . . . ? ? ? i don't think it does that . maybe if you're thinking in terms of the traditional chinese " six excesses " system . . . .

chocolate coconut water scalpers this new flavor of zico is delicious - silky and chocolate - y without the gag - inducing traits of some of the other fruity flavors . great as a post - workout substitute for chocolate milk or a banana . my little case ran out quickly as my husband discovered it and loves it , too . however , i went to re - order the same exact item and was shocked to see that the price of a 12 pack jumped from $ 21 . 51 to $ 53 . 95 ! come on , amazon , really ? this is obviously a hot item at the moment , but you're letting your sellers get away with blatant thievery ! what a disappointment .

christmas gift i thought i was buying a coffee maker which would be very convient for my mother . i did not realize how hard it was for her to get the t disks . not everyone shops on line , especially at age 76 . she lives in another state , in a rural area and is just too hard for her to find these disks . also i have never been able to find maxwell house disks for her

swanson chicken broth 48 oz aseptic box pack of 8 i like this larger size box of chicken broth from amazon because it makes just the right amount of soup ! for health reasons , i do wish it came with less sodium , but it does taste very good as is . 
=================
oreo not just for splitting and fusing white cremey filling anymore now in peanut butter . ok . so i admit it . i submitted this package to an elite board of taste testing , not my own taste buds . i am far beyond the age of reason . the board gave her approval , and how ! oreo . not just melt in your mouth white filling anymore . not even the monster super - thick filling variation anymore . now , in peanut butter fudge . can you really keep your hands off of these ? get a bag , and see ! passed the board .

pop ices when i received this product i notice that the box was wet . when i opened the box , i found that ten ( 10 ) of the pop ices had leaked . there appears to be a good variety of flavors and since i only received them yesterday i have not tried any yet . 
=================
already opened , items missing i have ordered this exact item from amazon a few times before . it is basically two 12 packs in one box . one of the 12 packs was already opened and was missing four of the mini bottles . this is the first time i have had this happen . it's not worth sending back , but it's extremely annoying . i will say that the product is great otherwise . it's virtually identical to 5 hour energy , but it costs half as much . the berry flavor isn't great , but it's not terrible either . 
=================
peach nectarine : taste like alka seltzer i bought this item with such great expectations but i am disappointed in the taste . yes , it is true that it smells great , just like peaches , and it has no calories but when you taste this beverage , it reminds me of alka seltzer ( yes , the pop - pop fizz fizz medicine ) . i don't recommend this product . however , if you can get past the bitter taste you may like it , buy with caution . you may want to buy only one case , ( 24 ) cans , for about $ 12 . 00 on subscribe and save to make sure you like it . i have tasted the talking rain kiwi strawberry which is five calories a can but it tastes great ; the calories are probably because of the juice and splenda added but i don't mind the five calories per can to have a great tasting beverage !

blue buffalo canned dog food i was not impressed one bit with this stuff . if it was any thinner you could pour it out of the can . i tried chicken soup for the dog lovers soul and it was an instant success with my dogs . actually had to break it up with a spoon . also it is much cheeper than blue buffalo and the quality is right up there with all other designer dog foods . most importantly it's also made in usa . 
=================
my four medium - large dogs love them ! these " certified organic " ( by oregon tilth ) baked dog treats are made as a pair of attached treats , 1 " x 1 . 25 " , separated by a " break " line along the longer dimension . i put " break " in quotes because , these treats are quite hard & do not always break right on the line . the ingredients list is " organic barley , organic lamb , organic carrots , organic apples , organic palm oil ( preserved with mixed tocopherols , a source of vitamin e ) , organic molasses " . the " guaranteed analysis " is crude protein : 9 . 0 % min , crude fat : 4 . 0 % min , crude fiber : 4 . 0 % max , moisture : 11 % max " . fyi , despite being " certified organic " , there is a " not intended for human consumption " disclaimer under the ingredients list . hence , i can personally testify to their delectability ( or lack thereof ) . . . ; o ) however , my " test panel " certainly can - if they could talk , that is . testing these treats were our four rescued shelter dogs : jolene , a female pit bull & boxer mix , niki , a female boxer mix , cosmo , a male boxer mix , & mollie , a female black lab mix . in the interest of full disclosure , the first three dogs listed are all eager & voracious eaters - rarely , if ever , do they turn up their noses at a treat . mollie , on the other hand , is far pickier , being a tentative eater . once placed in a " sit " , all four test subjects eagerly anticipated their treat . for the test , i gave each of them a single 1 " x 1 . 25 " treat , having broken them apart in another room . i gave each subject a treat , one at a time . jolene , niki & cosmo took their treat without hesitation ( cosmo rudely almost taking half of my fingers with his ) , while mollie had to give it a short " sniff " ( as is her custom ) prior to gingerly taking it from my hand . however , once in their possession , all four dogs eagerly devoured their treat , crunching it up in short order , mollie included . none of the them had any trouble crunching into the treats , from jolene who is only 40 pounds , to cosmo who is 55 pounds . once finished , they all looked back up with hopeful anticipation in case i had another one to offer them . so , based on these tests , i'd say these treats were a resounding success . if i had to take anything away from their score , it would be to dock them  star because they are so hard to break apart . of course , if you have relatively big dogs , you could always just give them two attached treats at a time & forego this issue altogether . therefore , i still awarded them 5 stars . . .

bait and switch this is not kalamata olive oil . 1 . tin has picture of normal olives not kalamata2 . no where on the tin does it say " kalamata " 3 . tasted it and it does not taste anything like kalamata ive had before . 4 . the description on site says 100 % kalamata . sending it back . . . . . updatethe same day i wrote this review i was contacted by mr . alexander mallas , with superolive . com , the seller . 650 - 591 - 1010 . he explained that the product description was written by the martinis company , the manufacturer . the kalamata is the region in greece where the olives are grown , not necessarily kalamata olives . i never knew there was such a place . the seller plans on clarifing this in their description . mr . mallas did say he attended an olive oil convention in greece and found that the locals make their own kalamata olive oil for themselves and it is not readily available to the public . the quest will continue . . . . it was a pleasure discussing the many different grades and types of olive oil . i plan on reading the book , extra virginity : the sublime and scandale , by tom mueller , which he recommended . i heard the program on npr , with this review . the martinis oil i have he said i can keep , with an acidy level of . 8 ( whatever that means ) i would only use it to fry fish , or other foods . i am satisfied with the response , in fact mr . mallas is a colorfull man , and would look forward to another discussion after completing myeducation . olive on . . . .

not quite a training meal let me start by stating we love the plum organic training meals - they have been a wonderful tool for helping us to transition our son to solid foods . when we saw this we thought it would be a great way to get him to start eating chunkier oatmeal . however , this is just juice and cinnamon - no oatmeal chunks ! it literally poured out ! seriously , gerber stage 1 meals are thicker than this ! the flavor is great - i will give it that . hence i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 . we mixed it with my son's single grain oatmeal to thicken it up and it made a great meal - but a really expensive one . we recommend the other meals - but not this . hope they improve this . 
=================
ok , taste , but too many calories and too expensive in the past i've enjoyed drinks with aloe vera . and i love green tea , so i had high hopes for this drink . the taste is ok , though the bits of passion fruit make give it a texture that is rather slimy . that combined with the fact a one cup serving has 80 calories , makes this a drink i would have to pass up . this might not be a problem for green tea drinkers that are not worried about calories , but they might be turned off by the bits of passion fruit floating around in the drink . also the price is a bit prohibitive . it works out to $ 2 . 08 per bottle , which seems a bit much for an 11 . 5 oz drink .

your dog will either love it or hate it i've never had a dog that has been interested in one of these bones . i've had a siberian husky and a mutt in the past and neither one would chomp on one of these nylabones . i have tried the different flavors and textures , but neither one was interested . years have past and we recently got a new siberian husky since we missed our old one . while he was teething i bought this for him hoping it may work , it didn't . i tried everything to cajole into liking this bone ; however , nothing would make him like this thing . my mom told me that her golden retreiver enjoys these , so perhaps it's just a breed thing . it's worth a shot to see if your dog would like this , but be warned that i have had no success . 
=================
other review dishonest the other review ( entitled 'fruit and branch mangler ) is dishonest . the reviewer wrote negative things about all the fruit pickers except his . in fact he has written countless negative reviews of many different products . he is a dishonest marketer who is gaming amazon for purely selfish reasons . i don't know a thing about this fruit picker , but i feel an obligation to go to places where the reviewer has done his damage to warn people that the review he wrote can't possibly be true .

cool product but results hardly last i bought these xl tablets because i thought they would last awhile . . . . but they don't . i only tried half a tablet since these xl are supposed to be extra potent and the packaging description even says you can cut them in half for a " regular dose " . these tablets take a minute or two to dissolve and are pretty bland tasting , but nothing horrible . i even read some tips to make the effects last longer and scraped my tongue before sucking on the tablet . its pretty amazing how a lemon tastes good ! i even squeezed lemon juice into a cup and diluted it with a bit of water and it tasted like i was drinking sweet lemonaid ! sadly , the effects only lasted about 5 minutes and then everything was normal . so if half a tablet only gets you 5 minutes then i'm guessing a full dose gets you about 10 minutes . its cool for a party gag or something odd to try but i kind of wish the effects lasted longer

why previous incorrect reviews ? the complete list of ingredients and nutritional facts are completely available down to the last detail . either they have added them in the last 2 weeks or they were not noticed .

deceptively tasty corn products of all types give me migraines , so i'm always looking for soda that doesn't have high fructose corn syrup . it's difficult to find regular soft drinks that don't contain corn syrup . i decided to give the switch a try because it contains ordinary sugar . i liked the taste of the black cherry switch . it tasted more like fruit punch than black cherry though . this makes sense because cherries are at the bottom of the fruit ingredients list . apple juice comprises most of the fruit juice in black cherry switch . marketing this as " black cherry " is a bit misleading . they should call it carbonated " fruit drink " instead of " black cherry . " it annoys me when marketers employ deceptive advertising . that being said , i did enjoy the taste . i just recommend that people read the ingredients list before buying . 
=================
both of our cats love this ! both of our cats love this ! i have paid special attention to the ingredients list and have been pleased to find that it does not include corn products or byproducts . sadly , most cat foods on the market have corn as their first , second , or third ingredient . sometimes it is both the second and third ingredient ( corn meal and another corn byproduct , etc . ) . i wish i had known this fact a long time ago . i have recently been looking for a healthier choice for my two cats and even the ones that state that they are a healthy alternative tend to contain ingredients that i would question and in amounts that are alarming . this is the only cat food at my market that does not contain corn as a main ingredient and it seems the healthiest alternative . i have tried ( through amazon ) other alternatives that are just as healthy , but sadly my cats did not like the taste . this one they adore . healthy and tasty . i couldn't ask for more . 
=================
high price lawry seasoning is great , however , the price is too high . i can buy the 40 0z . bottle for $ 5 . 12 at sam's club . why are you selling for 9 + dollars . i will be more careful shopping in the future . 
=================
bizarre flavors on the plus side , this is a big , heavy plastic jar full of colorful jelly beans . on the negative side , so many of the flavors are " spit - em - out - quick " nasty . my wife and i thought only about a third were actually pleasant . a better idea would be to get a big jar full of just a few " normal " flavors . 
=================
just like car oil this is nasty stuff . when you compare to the great oils out there , this stuff is like using oil from your car . the best i have found to date , that also gives your popcorn that theater butter taste is from wabash valley farms real theatre popcorn popping oil . even my teenager can tell the difference . 
=================
pretty good this mix is pretty good , made with water . the texture can be strange if you add extras . . . if you add blueberries , don't make 12 large muffins , make about 16 small ones , or they will be gooey . and you need to cook them at 375 ( rather than 400 ) for approx . 10 minutes longer than it says . 
=================
good cinnamon for this price the product description is a little sparse , so when i came back to re - order and saw there were still no reviews , i thought i would add some more information . first , as you probably guessed from the price , this is cinnamon burmanii , so it is not the most flavorful variety of cinnamon , and it is not really suitable for grinding . the product come in 3 individual sealed packages with a reusable zip - top seal , which is nice , because you don't need a container to store it in once it is opened . the main thing i use them in is to flavor coffee instead of sugar , and they work pretty decently for that . for a normal , 6 - oz cup of coffee , you only need a half of a stick . they are pretty tough sticks though , i just switched to a 12 - oz mug and i use a whole stick . they have a good cinnamon flavor , being more sweet than spicy , so if you are looking for spicier cinnamon you may way to keep looking . i experimented with steeping the cinnamon in the coffee before pouring it in the cup , but it seemed a little bitter when i did that . you are better off putting it in right when you are ready to start drinking your hot beverage . 
=================
gave me tummy trouble for a couple of months my stomach had a " tight " feeling - like i couldn't relax it . i realized it started feeling that way around the same time i started drinking coco libre every day . i stopped drinking it and right away my stomach " relaxed " and it's been fine ever since . 
=================
good but not as great as the smaller packs the larger bags of these are not as good as the smaller bags . even my 2 year old agrees . the pieces are smaller and there's not as much seasoning on them as the 3oz bags or whatever size the smaller ones are . it won't take long for us to eat these but we will buy the smaller sizes from now on . sad because these were a little less in cost . oh well .

warning : this comes in a huge box i was both horrified and delighted when this huge 2 x 1 . 5 x 1 feet box from amazon came to the office for me . no wonder ordering it with amazon prime 2 - day shipping still took 3 days ( plus the weekend . . . ) so be warned , all , for $ 20 ( or $ 15 , or whatever the current price is ) , you will be getting a huge box , and if you ship it to work , your coworkers will all wonder what it is and you'll be forced to tell them , and then guilted into giving up a few bags to sate the hungry , curious masses ! less pirate booty for you ! ! ! ! ! ! !

popcorn seasoning we like the popcorn with the wabash valley farm popcorn seasoning since we have learned to put just the right amount on it . when we first used it , we were very disappointed because it was too salty . we tried it again , used less and now really enjoy our popcorn with it . 
=================
comparing velveeta pasta and cheese mixes there are two velveeta pasta and cheese dinners . this one , and kraft velveeta original shells & cheese , 12 oz . they both use packets of cheese sauce , not packets of powder . but sadly , this one's not that good . it's salty , and the tiny bits of broccoli are few and far between . and with all the sodium ( 1230 mg per serving compared to 940 mg for the regular shells and cheese ) , it's a long way from healthy . shells and cheese is better . it's pure , creamy comfort food that goes down smooth and leaves no aftertaste . the pasta's ridged - shell shape makes every bite taste good , as dribbles of cheese seep into each piece and stick to its sides . it's much better than the broccoli version . . . and way more yummy ( if more expensive ) than the regular kraft macaroni & cheese supermac & cheese pasta and sauce , 6 - ounce boxes ( pack of 24 ) . 
=================
it's not butter , it's margarine the ingredients list on the package says margarine , as in trans hydrogenated fat . so not like the ingredients listed on amazon ( lists butter ) and not like the traditional stroopwafeln - health reasons aside , they taste so much better with butter ! i'm assuming this is true for all the stroopwafeln ( stroopie ) shipped by this company - there seem to be several different sizes . to their credit though , they are going to look for real butter stroopwafeln to stock , and send me some for no charge . i'll let you know how it goes ! 
=================
not as good as the orlando brand great service from seller but the product is not as good as other brands i have used before - specifically orlando brand . but it's 10 times better than that crap they sell at grocery store that say pure but smell like alcohol . 
=================
the only aftertaste is from the real birch oil , as i have made birch brew since i was a kid , and is not from any sweetener . the reviews complaining of aftertaste , and just labeling it the " new age natural sweeteners " have never tasted real root beer , made with real birch root and not just flavoring . the aftertaste they are complaining about with this soda is the complex birch oil aftertaste ( in any real old recipe ) . i used to live in quarryville , pennsylvania and my neighbor showed me and my family how to make birch brew with the cleaned roots , and the aftertaste is the same here . we live in a society with everything watered down to the point it all tastes like nothing with sugar added . this is the best commercial root beer i have tasted sugar or not .

proceed with caution ! was at a market ( world cost plus ? ) and came across this . there was another brand too , melinda's or meranda's . . . something , yeah . i decided to go with this one as the other had carrots and mango puree and other stuff ( blah ) . i'm sure this is too make it not so hot but i figured this might cover up it's natural taste too . so i stopped at taco bell on the way home . figured start with something mild and got a ranchero chicken soft taco . put one drop of this stuff and smeared it around . not bad . complimented it nicely . second was a meximelt . one drop only again . this time it seemed they merged together and boosted each others spices . by the time i was done i had a nice long heat going and some sweats which lasted untill i got home . you know when you take a shot of hard liquor on an empty stomach ? that burn ? imagine that burn slooooowly moving through your system . yeah , it' like that . i'm sure it will kill any parasites living in your intestinal tract . might even remove any bubble gum you swallowed as a kid . next day , tried it again , this time on a burger . threw some ranch on it and tried 2 drops this time . got to my second burger and knew if i did 2 drops again that i might be in trouble , so went with only 1 drop . 1 or 2 drops per item seems to be the right amount . pouring this stuff on like it was tapatio will without a doubt lead to problems ! ! but i will be taking this to work for all those tapatio junkies and others who just eat raw chilis straight up . hehe , let's see if they think they're still macho now , huh ? ! ! this stuff is deceiving ! seems fine at first , but man o man , that heat will catch up and bite you ! i have bought the habanero version of tabasco and didn't care for it . that was mainly vinegar with way too much of a black pepper type taste . it is hot , but i ended up throwing that away . this however , i definetly will be buying more of ! ! ! it may overpower your food if you use too much of it , but for most part it merges with your food and creates a new flavor . those who said it tasted bad or metallic must have had a bad batch . by the way , me , i'm not . . . . well wasn't a big chili person untill recently . i used that mild sauce ( aka " weak sauce " ) up untill a few years ago . so i haven't trained myself into eating stuff as hot as this . pretty much an average guy with a growing interest for new things : ) update : finally did try that melinda's version of naja . did not care for it at all ! it had a very quick bite to it and too much of that pepper extract taste ( even though it isn't loaded with extract ) . sadly the melinda's is sitting the fridge , barely touched . . . . . but my dave's is almost done .

cat gained 7 pounds after 2 years diet on this food i started buying iams weight control and was keep buying it for 2 years . the purpose was to keep cat's weight under control . but he was hungry all the time and demanded more and more food . even though , i was giving him half less food portion that it was recommended on the package , he was keeping gaining weight . his weight was 12 pounds two years ago , now it is 19 pounds ! ! ! veterinarian told us that he is obese and should be on the diet to reach at least 15 lb . he should get only 270 kcal per day and no more . now i am giving my cat purina weight control . cat's behavior is completely different ! ! ! he is so much happier , and is not demanding food anymore . as a tip , add water to your cat dry food , it helps with prevention of urinary track problems . also , serving sizes should be smaller than it is recommenced on the packages . back to the iams weight control , i personally believe that they add some kind of appetite simulating substances into there food , and should be sued for this !

good brew but . . . this is a good brew for the time and expense involved . that being said , the longer you ferment and bottle condition , the better it will be . i thought i had drank all of my batch when i discovered two additional bottles tucked away . they were the best and they had sat for a good three months . give it time . if you follow the included directions you will get closer to six gallons vs the five in the amazon description . additionally , the included directions state to use sugar . obviously dme / lme will work better , but you can still use plain old old sugar ( i've used brown sugar and avoided any " cider " like finish ) . if you order the " full kit " it comes with carbonation drops and a dextrose adjunct . save yourself the money , get this kit , use sugar and bottle condition forever . . . 
=================
great product , but look for a better price elsewhere my 10 - month old loves these , but i found them at my local bj's warehouse for a better price . a pack of 3 bags for $ 7 . 49 . when we go out to run errands , i make a snack container for my little one , and mix a few things together for variety . whenever fussiness ensues , i take out the container and let him choose what he wants . he always chooses the yogurt melts and gerber crunchers ( look like baby cheese puffs ) . 
=================
overpriced water so the water is great and getting it delivered to your front door is even better . however , i didn't realize these were sold in the store for as little as $ 1 . 50 and here you're paying 2x the amount ! probably would have steered clear and purchased at the grocery store instead . lesson learned .

cat food made with not - disgusting ingredients ! who knew ? the short version : my picky cats took to this immediately and it seems to have helped them with their digestive ( throwing up ) issues . the ingredients are much healthier than the standard " animal by - products " found in even the pricier pet food brands ( iams , pedigree , fancy feast , etc . ) . even though it's a little more expensive , i think it's worth it . this company also makes a similar product for dogs that is packaged in a similar - looking bag , so make sure you get the correct stuff . now for the longer version . . . pro : ( 1 ) healthier for the cats ! no scary bits - and - pieces - by - products ingredients ! many pet food brands - many " premium " pet - food brands have the exact same disgusting ingredients as el cheapo store brands , but charge you three times the price and give you the false idea that you're feeding your pets well . ( 2 ) small pieces - - my cats don't seem to like the bigger kibble sizes . the dog food version of this has much larger pieces with little peas / carrots mixed in . ( 3 ) nice packaging - - i like these plastic bags much more than the standard paper bags ( that often tear ) and the cardboard boxes ( that are easily dumped by the cats ) . plus , if the water dish gets knocked over , it won't soak through the bag and make the food soggy and gross . ( 4 ) did i mention healthier for the pets ? seriously , everyone should find out what's in standard pet food , because it's completely disgusting and in no way safe or healthy for pets . while i won't be eating my pets' food any time soon , at least with halo i know that ( technically ) i probably could . and if i had little kids running around , i'd rather have a brand of pet food like this around in case curious kids decide to taste it . con : ( 1 ) harder to find - - i have been purchasing this from my local organic store . i have not seen it carried at any other grocery / drugstore and i live in a fairly large metropolitan area . it may be carried at a petco / other pet chain , but the last time i went into a big pet box store , there were no healthy cat foods . everything had byproducts and gross stuff . so i haven't been back to one of those to check for halo . since petco apparently carries it online now , they are probably carrying it in the stores as well . but it doesn't seem to be any cheaper there than at my organic store , so i'll stick to the local store . speaking of price . . . ( 2 ) cost - - it's not a ridiculous price and is certainly worth it when you compare ingredients , but it's hard to get other family / friends to buy good stuff for their own pets when they can pick up el cheapo pet food for a buck or two . i'm trying to find it online for a little cheaper , but so far ( once s + h is factored ) , haven't found it yet . i'd also like to buy it in bulk , but haven't found that yet either . minor annoyance : the bag design - halo carries wet and dry food for cats and dogs . they also seem to carry the same flavor for each animal - for instance , there is wild salmon cat food and wild salmon dog food . now , the first time i buy a new food brand for the cats , i do exactly what i do for myself : i turn the package over and read the description and all the ingredients before buying . when i go to buy more , i don't usually read it . so i just grabbed the pink bag that said halo and spot's stew - wild salmon . when i dumped some of the food into my cats' bowl , the kibbles were about twice the size and also had little peas and carrots in it . i thought that was weird , but assumed they had changed the packaging . then when i put the bag back into the cabinet , i noticed something - in the picture on the front of the bag , the woman was holding a dog . not a cat . and of course , then i read it , saw that it saw dog food , and felt kind of silly . but you know , pink bag , watercolor - like picture of woman with an animal , had the correct flavor and brand . . . anyway , the cats were not really that interested in the dog food , but they ate about a bowl or so and also had wet food until i could get back to the organic store for cat food . luckily , i had someone to give the dog food to so it didn't go to waste . if you're buying this , make sure it says cat food . the bags are similar and if you're in a hurry and not paying attention , you might end up with the wrong stuff . apparently ellen degeneres is a co - owner of this company , which is cool , i guess , so if you need a celebrity thumbs - up before you buy anything , you've got at least one !

poor taste , poor mixing we have now gone through 4 formulas , and here are our conclusions . similac ( non - organic ) : they use cows which have been given growth hormones . seriously , even most non - organic milks in grocery stores do not use growth hormones . our baby spent his first four months off the growth - charts until it finally dawned on me to check into this . similac organic : our baby liked this one , but then a nyt article revealed that this formula has a significant amount of cane sugar added - no wonder he liked it . earth's best : we really struggled with the transition from similac to earth's best . we went through a 2 week transition of 3 / 4 similac , 1 / 4 earth's best . . . with a slow increase in the earth's best . even to our adult taste senses , it had a fishy odor and taste ( likely the dha , which is supposedly taken from seaweed for this brand ) . and it never went into solution . we would constantly have to interrupt his feeds to check and see whether the nipple was clogged - being a baby , he would suck and suck - - even when no milk was coming out . our baby developed eczema - i am not convinced the formula caused the problem . babies get eczema . but after trying everything else ( detergents , lotions , soaps , etc ) and reading some reviews questioning whether earth's best caused eczema , we decided to try one more formula switch . baby's only organic : " now here is something i can add to my coffee when we run out of milk , " says my husband . it has a wonderful smell of oatmeal . no transition needed , our baby finished an entire 8oz in one sitting . it goes into solution better than both the similac and the earth's best . no gi distress or constipation when we made the switch . i agree with other reviewers that it is annoying that the canisters are small , but scoop for scoop , it is less expensive than earth's best . just waiting for amazon to have a " subscription " discount . i highly recommend baby's only !

hard to tell if it is working although it is hard to judge this product with only trying it once , i cannot give any real proof that it does give one energy or the immune system . the taste is tart ; although it isn't not bad , it isn't exactly the taste one would seek for a refreshment . if you drink it down quickly it makes it taste a little better . considering the price of this product , i probably would not buy it . it is pricy for a product that is hard to tell if it is working .

genius concept ! absolutely genius concept . 0 footprint , not like those bulky formula holders ! the only thing is they are really over priced here . they're much cheaper purchased at your local store .

sadly this product doesn't live up to its name at all . . . i was quite happy to give this eboost acai pomegranate product a try - after all , i love pomegranates and really like acai . . . i couldn't taste either of those flavors in this drink . i added a pouch to 8 fluid ounces of water - it immediately begin to fizz and ended up making a tiny bit of a pink mess ( this powder foams like crazy when added to water ) : strike one . then i gave it a bit of time to settle before giving it a try : wow , i was very taken aback . the flavor is very mineral - y , both from first taste all the way thru to after - taste , where it gets even worse , way worse : strike two . i took a look at the package quite a bit closer then , to see if all this was worth it , at least hoping to find some type of super - positive health boost worth all the foaming , and mineral ( yucky ) flavor : there wasn't anything . strike three . i agree that these minerals and vitamins are good & necessary , but i wouldn't use this particular method to get them : there are much better products on the market to take in things this powder touts like zinc . and that's that . . . and to end , the product is pink . very pink . now , i like pink , but i was taken aback by this : my main complaint is this doesn't taste like acai or pomegranante at all , so it just doesn't live up to its name .

outrageous shipping and handling fee i have not yet received my order but have eaten these delicious treats . so , i am sure that they will be enjoyable . however , the shipping fee of $ 11 . 99 for this small order is outrageous and i know that amazon has negotiated very good rates with their selected courier carrier and i cannot believe that the shipping and handling fee is as high as the cost that is being passed on to your customers . this fee seems to be a new source of revenue for on - line companies . . . i wanted four boxes of these sweets and chose not to purchase this number since the s & h fee was even more expensive .

tasty but won't eat unless they change the coloring this is my favorite candy but i found out they use cochineal for the pink coloring . cochineal are beetles scraped from cacti , dried and crushed . i don't eat food with bugs in it . it's a shame they don't change it because these are so delicious .

excellent flour ! i've purchased this flour from amazon in order to make pita bread . it's wonderful ! atta flour is ground finer than other whole wheat flours and so gives excellent results . i also use it to make no - knead bread , and the loaves are turning out lovely . also , i've successfully substituted it for unbleached all - purpose flour in pancakes , and muffins with excellent results . only difference is that the batter seems to see rise and bubble up when it sits but i just stir back together to smooth it before pouring / scooping into trays , and it bakes and rises beautifully . i'm still experimenting with it and will try it with cakes next . highly recommended ! update : i noticed a little later that the flour was sent to me past its " better if used by " date of december 27 , 2009 . my item was shipped to me on january 30 , 2010 . amazon's customer service was wonderful , and i received a prompt full refund from them since they couldn't guarantee that an immediate replacement from the seller would not have the same problem . unfortunately , i could not change my positive review of the seller ( india connect ) to outline the problem and express my displeasure at being sent a food item past it's " better if used by " date . of course i realize that flour does not immediately expire , and thankfully i had it stored in the fridge . so , even though we used it when we first got it with no ill effect , it is a matter of principal that i was sold twenty pounds of flour past its " better if used by " date . that's just wrong . so i wanted to give fair warning to anyone who might want to order this item ( sujata chakki atta flour , 320 - ounce bag , from india connect ) . thanks amazon for taking care of this .

i throw away other cheese straws first of all , i would like to comment regarding previous reviews . i do not think the first review in 2005 was done by an employee , and that's not really a fair statement but rather an assumption lacking any real fact or evidence . it seems like a very small company that just enjoys making cheese straws and wants to share them with others . i sincerely doubt that , at the great price they are , the company even makes a ton of profit - which is a shame . secondly , after tasting aunt lizzie's cheese straws for the first time this fall , i will not eat anyone else's . i literally threw away a package of a very popular cheese straw company that i received yesterday as a gift because when i tasted them , they just tasted bland and floury . i could not even bring myself to finish them . i crave aunt lizzie's cheese straws so much . ( i recommend trying them with some shiraz or other wine ! ) our company gave out aunt lizzie's cheese straws as a corporate customer gift this year , and i bet that aunt lizzie will have a slew of new customers after that . thanks , aunt lizzie ! ! : )

careful ! read the back of can . . . . . . . i did agree with these two reviews . excellent refrieds ; the best by far ! then one day i bought a can at savemart and the back of the can said arizona where it ususlly said a product of mexico ! ! sure enough , not very good now ! check it out . i am not sure if these will be replacing the mexico beans ? ? but this is all i can find now - arizona ! ! blaach ! ! !

love the tin , hate the taste . i'm adventurous when trying new foods and the fun , graphic tin definitely gave me the extra push to try these organic ginger mints . well , lets just say they're not going on my 'most awesome foods ever ! ' list . i'm not a huge fan of ginger , but figured i'd give these a try anyway . they're not a 'smooth' candy like some mints are ( slightly gritty ) and have a sharp ginger 'bite' towards the middle - end that lingers for long after its dissolved . they're so potent , i tasted it for a good hour after just one had been finished . i gave it to family members who don't mind the taste of ginger and they too were disappointed in how they tasted . while i'm not going back to these , the other flavors do interest me . points though , for the hinged , reusable tin ( i'm thinking they'd be great for the lush cosmetics line of soap chunks and solid shampoo slices that are sold by the pound and dissolve in the shower if they're not dried , tinned and moved out of the bathing area . also great for use when traveling with the soaps / shampoos and cheaper than buying one of their branded tins ) . made in mexico , mine contained about 40 , beige - colored mints . 
=================
not bad ! with all the hoopla , i decided to give this a try , without any great expectations . i was expecting this to be very bland , but surprisingly it wasn't . i thought it was pretty medium in taste and not bad at all . 
=================
not a big fan of pepper . . . . but i liked these . they're tangy and salty , and the pepper adds just a hint of spicy - ness . some may not like emerald products ; they tend to be heavy on the " flavoring " side of things . i overdosed on caramel covered walnuts once - - only for people with a really really sweet tooth . these were much more to my taste - - tangy and salty . try them !

dry food snubbing cat loves it our cat loves loves loves his tuna , and particularly saucy / stinky meow mix tender favorites real tuna & whole shrimp in sauce , 2 . 75 - ounce cups ( pack of 24 ) . the more gravy / sauce and stinkier the better . he will tolerate dry food when he is " starving " ( he never really starves ) but is picky . when i put this in his wet food dish , he looked at me in a confused way , then proceeded to snarf it down . it's not as pungent as one of the other reviews led me to think it might be , but perhaps the stink of his wet food has my olfactory standards warped .

great trap i have two dogs in my back yard and i can never seam to keep the flies off of them . this year was really bad , before i got this trap they had 3 types of fly repellent on them and they still were getting over ran by flies . i got this trap because the only bad review was about the small and i was willing to try anything that was only around $ 6 . i have to say that i love this trap when i first mixed the trap the water was green and for the first day and only got 1 or 2 flies , but after that the water turned yellow and then the flood gates opened . by the end of day 2 there were at least 100 and within about 3 maybe 4 days there were so many flies that they went able to get to the poison but still were stuck in the cup . after that the fly around my house were gone for about a week but are starting to come back . i will be getting many more of the victor fly traps for the rest of this year and all of next .

my dog loves these . . . but is this three total or nine total ? first , my dog loves these dingo bones . he won't touch any other kind of bone , but these are a special treat . he's very finicky , so i'm thrilled to find something he enjoys so much . plus , since these don't have the knots at the end , i'm able to give them to him and feel confident that there won't be any gastrointestinal issues later . ( my sister had a poor dog that swallowed the knotted end of a bone and had to have a surgery to remove the blockage . ) but this particular amazon item . . . is it for three packages of three bones ? one would have to imagine , since it's over $ 10 . . . but assuming it's so doesn't make it so . it says it's a three - pack , but there are three bones per package , so it doesn't necessarily mean there are three packages . one package of three generally goes for $ 5 . 99 at petsmart , so i can't imagine amazon selling it for $ 10 . 80 , but stranger things have happened . anyone have any idea how i could find out for sure before i order ?

horseradish peas when i first got my order and open the can so i can eat some , i realized these peas aren't even that hot and didn't even taste like wasabi . a quick look at the ingredients label confirmed my suspicions when i saw the ingredient horseradish labeled on it . unfortunately for me i bought 4 cans .

bake your own . . . don't pay this much ! ! ! these cookies are delicious but most assuredly not worth $ 8 . 99 . shame on amazon for charging this much ! ! ! ! amazing that amazon has the audacity to charge this much . i have bought these cookies at whole foods for $ 4 . 99 and at natural grocers / vitamin cottage for $ 4 . 69 . i thought these prices were too much . . . i was shocked when i saw them priced even higher on amazon . grace's has their own website but they charge more than whole foods . since when did we have to dole out this much money to get a good cookie ? ? ? my mother used to make cookies this good - now i just need to find the right recipe to replace the need to purchase these too expensive cookies . i would rather do without and send the money to some needy family . seems that amazon would rather rip off the consumer and keep the extra for themselves .

c'mon , people . get real , other reviewers ! this coffee right here is obviously at least twice as good as what you can get directly from nespresso on its website . nespresso is clearly fobbing off inferior product - - probably coffee beans made in china , or maybe even taiwan ! ninety - nine ninety - nine here at amazon , or fifty - seven at nespresso - your choice . just remember : you get what you pay for . . . right ?

why not promote crystal light pure ? ? ? to help me drink more water i used flavor crystals to make it more palatable . when i visited my doctor i was told i had high blood pressure . i asked why for 66 years my blood pressure was normal but now it was high and i needed 2 prescriptions . doctor said that was normal . since i like to research i found that the crystals i was using had aspartame , one of the most dangerous artificial sweeteners . side effects include headaches , anxiety , abdominal pain , nausea , heart palpitations , irritable bowel syndrome & high blood pressure . acesulfame potassium is another artificial sweetener used in some crystal light varieties . this sweetener contains methylene chloride , which is a known carcinogen - long - term use of this carcinogen may cause cancer . other side effects include nausea , headaches and impaired liver . i stopped using anything with aspartame ( threw out the prescriptions ) and my blood pressure is now normal . the " natural " crystal light is not really natural because it contains aspartame ( which i was told is also genetically modified ) . crystal light has a very good product called " natural " . it uses cane sugar ( not gm sugar beet ) & truvia . this is a much better product and only a few calories more than the " natural " which is not really natural . aspartame is not natural . many other synthetically sweetened products use aspartame . you have to read all labels . it's better to eat smaller amounts of real food rather then more synthetically sweetened , gm frankenfood and avoid the side effects . what's the big deal in a few extra natural calories ?

make sure you really like cocoa before you buy this the all - natural ingredients make for very pleasant reading - with dried cane syrup ; rice , wheat , corn flour ; and sesame seeds combining to provide a delivery vehicle for the anti - oxidants contained in cocoa . unfortunately for me , the taste of cocoa was so strong , that it overpowered everything else - i could barely detect traces of cinnamon or the other ingredients . while i was very pleased with the fact that there is practically no chemical aftertaste , i don't see myself becoming a fan of this product . happy snacking ! ~ damodar

not what i expected i buy a lot of if you care brand products & was very pleased to see they make environmentally friendly gloves . i ordered them through the subscribe & save program thinking i wouldn't worry about household gloves again ! i am so disappointed in these . i am canceling the subscription with amazon . the cotton flock lining is a joke . i certainly cannot feel it . the rubber is stiff & the fit is poor . i ordered the size small & have to keep tugging them up because they are too long in the fingers . they move down a bit making matters worse . for some reason the pinkie finger in particular is way too long ; more so than the extra length in the other fingers . my hands start to sweat in these pretty darn fast . when i need to take them off , they don't come off easy despite the fact that they are too long / big . i have to practically peel them off . they are not comfortable . the only thing to like about them besides being environmentally friendly is that they are a pretty cheerful green color . i am going back to my old gloves by casabella . i have yet to find a better pair of household gloves . they fit well , last long & are very comfortable . they also have more meat to them for protection when you are using really hot or cold water . don't try using the if you care with scalding hot water ! amazon sells casabella & casabella is what i recommend .

not as handsome , but filled with just as much flavor ! these belly flop jelly belly jelly beans are in odd shapes , some are stuck together and they are not as perfectly formed as the regular ones are , but they taste exactly the same and once they are in your mouth , you never know just what they looked like , and they are half the price . my husband says " order more " ! !

wow , that dust travels pros : * very , very cheap * may be healthier than clay - based * not a bad odorcons : * clumps are very difficult to remove from the sides and bottom of box * i found white dust everywhere within 5 feet of the box , including on top of the refrigerator , and on pots and pans above the refrigeratori started using this to get away from the possibly harmful clay dust . i was pleased with how cheap it is . that helped me overlook the fact that it was a workout to get the clumps out . but after a year of use , i could no longer overlook the extremely fine white dust that was accumulating on my peanut butter jars on top of the refrigerator . i am now using world's best , which is more expensive , but worrth it . buy it from amazon or petfooddirect .

love it ! and mold shouldn't be a problem . . . just received my beaba today and made two purees for baby . it's convenient , easy to use - - makes making baby food a breeze . before i was steaming in the microwave , which kills some of the nutrients , not to mention that the plastic i was using may or may not have bpa . with the beaba i don't need to worry about this anymore ! i just take whatever we're cooking for ourselves , pop it into the beaba and by the time our dinner is ready , so is baby's ! i was a little hesitant to purchase this because i read some of the reviews about mold - - and it's difficult to know what the reviewers are referring to exactly without having the product in front of you . now that i've used the beaba , i'm wondering if the people who complained of mold were following the directions . i can see how mold could form in the water reservoir if you don't empty it after use . obviously , mold can form any where there is water pooling for extended periods . however , the instructions clearly state to empty any water from the reservoir after each use , which i did immediately after using . i also left the top off just to ensure that any additional drops left inside would dry up . if you take this precaution , i don't see any way possible for mold to have the opportunity to form . when the instruction booklet talks about descaling the reservoir using vinegar , it's to ensure there is no lime build up - - not mold . after having used the beaba , i don't think anyone interested in purchasing this should be turned off by claims of mold . if you take care of the machine properly , it won't be a problem .

failed on delivery , awesome on customer service i ordered the french vanilla , the only creamer i ever like . unfortunately , before my item was shipped , amazon put the item under review and sent me hazelnut . yuck ! i was refunded the money , thankfully , but was told that i could reorder after the item was no longer being reviewed . as i spoke to the amazon representative , i checked the item and saw that the price had increased . amazon customer service took care of me and i was completely satisfied by the time i got off the phone . i got a refund for the item and i'll be getting a replacement item once it becomes available . thank you amazon . although this means i'll be stuck w / more powered creamer or starbucks until my creamer comes in .

this one was a miss ! i like the convenience and quality of the k - cups and thought the hot chocolate would be as good as the coffee and tea . the problem is the chocolate is a fine powder so it remains in the container instead of dissolving and flowing into the mug . it is better to run a mug of hot water from your keurig and then stir in your favorite packet of hot chocolate mix .

not good in presto percolator i tried using these filters in a presto percolator . even with less coffee , only 4 scoops , the brew basket overflowed and washed a lot of the grounds out the top . with other pots they may work but not the presto 12 cup . too bad - the wrap around filters are a pain . amazon only sent 1 pack of 100 filters . when notified they refunded the money for the filters they didn't send . this worked out in my favor because of the above . i am glad i don't have 2400 filters that don't work in the pot - 100 is plenty . i bought so many because a friend , who must have a very different percolator said they work for him . he almost got 2300 filters for christmas !

not as good as the prepared stuff this is good , but not as tasty as the stuff you buy in the stores already prepared . it does have a slight aftertaste , and since i'm more calorie - conscious than worried about suger ( not diabetic ) , i went back to the regular pudding ; tastes 10 times better and more chocolaty ! : )

 " pop " star ! ! i have spent lots of cash on white popcorn . tried most of the fancy ones . i ran out of all of it one friday night and was forced to 'lower my popcorn standards " and buy some orville . i made faces as i popped it with olive oil ( try it . extra flavor ) on top of the stove because it was going to disappoint . i always make a huge pan so i can eat it for a couple days . all but 3 kernels popped ! amazing ! out of that huge pan i found 2 partial hulls . it tasted delicious , had just enough crunch but still melted in my mouth . if orville was around , i'd stalk him ! ! ! with all the money i will save , not giving it to the amish , i'm gonna stock up ! btw , imo , air poppers should be illegal !

vitamin c plus caffeine , but weird taste this adds vitamin c and caffeine to your water , which is great for people who are looking for that . caffeine may boost your workouts , and is the daily drug of choice for many of us , but watch out for side effects and don't over do it . the deal breaker for me on this one was taste . it tastes sort of like sweet fruit punch kool - aid , with a pronounced aftertaste . i strongly prefer optimum nutrition essential amino energy , fruit fusion , a powdered caffeine add - on , or some of the mio products .

barilla mezze penne with spicy marinara sauce let me start by saying i love barilla sauces . it's the only sauce i buy in the jar to use and their marinara in the jar is the best base i've ever used . this however was terrible . i was completely disappointed . i heated it as per instructions but needed to heat it another 45 seconds after mixing it up in a microwaveable bowl because it was only just warm . it is not very spicy at all and i could mainly only taste tomatoes . the pasta had a very strange taste to it , not sure how to describe it but i had to make myself finish it . i wanted to throw it out but i'm not a wasteful person so i ate it . there is well under 2 cups total to eat so if you were giving it to a very young child it may be enough but i had to go make my lunch after eating it as i felt like i had nothing to eat and , no , i am not a big eater . usually just a sandwich is more than enough for me for a meal . i would not buy this in a store for any price . i feel like i even wasted my electricity by heating it . glad i got this from vine so it was free or i'd really be mad as this is expensive for what little you get even if it had been good and i'm glad i have already used barilla products because if this had been my first taste of theirs i would never use anything of theirs .

weak , but tasty ! this product met my expectations very well . the flavor wasn't quite what i expected , however . i expected a cinnamon flavor with subtle hints of hazelnut and vanilla . instead , i found that all three flavors are pretty evenly distributed . the end result is a cacophony of flavors which is very powerful and distracts from the natural coffee flavor . the beans themselves are rather small . because of this , i think , the coffee is rather weak . i find myself having to use 30 % more coffee per pot than with my traditional coffee beans . the cup , when poured black , has a very weak color to it , if you add creamer the look is very reminiscent of tea with milk . when i first tried the coffee i was very unhappy with the results . however , after tweaking the amount of grounds i use ( as well as increasing the coarseness of my grounds ) i found a product that was palatable . would i buy it again ? probably not . however , i can see many people who dislike strong coffee truly enjoying this . 
=================
be careful here these have a good smell and a not so great flavor , at first . they are oddly addictive . i am use to maltitol and its effects on the digestive track . these i must say , caught me a bit off guard . my 16 year old daughter ate almost a pack and she was ill for 2 days . ( im sure she wont appreciate me sharing this ) she had severe stomach cramps and unstoppable diarrhea . i did not have any terribly bad symptoms . but i did have a bit of bloating . my other concern with this product is that the net carbs in one serving ( 6 pieces ) is 11 grams . that is extremely high especially if you are diabetic or following a low - carb diet . reference point : 1 / 2 of a hershey bar is 10 . 5 net carbs . i think i would prefer the hershey bar . 
=================
would've been delicious . . . i am sad to report that all four bags of reese's arrived melted . the chocolate melted into blocks and i could not break any of it apart . i'm bummed because reese's would've been such a delicious treat .

from proton pump inhibitor to wdderspoon's manuka honey i discovered that long - term use of a proton pump inhibitor was killing me . so i stopped . the resuting reflux was horrendous . i started using 2 teaspoons of wdderspoon's manuka honey 30 minutes before meals . i have not needed any type of antacid . i am careful though . i don't eat known irritants like coffee , tomatoes , and chile ( green or red ) . i stay away from all gluten containing foods - or those that might have been cross - contaminated . nevertheless , with wdderspoon's manuka honey , i have broadened the types of food i eat again . the taste is good and i have learned to like the 30 minutes i wait from " taking " the honey until i eat . i don't use antacid . this manuka honey is much better than proton pump inhibitors .

should have ordered from another source ? ? ? ? ? it took a month for delivery . the stated time was 2 - 9 business days . the delivery was shipped the day after i complained to the company , ( gristedes in new york ) , . . . hmmmm . . . . . ups couldn't figure out how to deliver to a p . o . box ? ? ? ? ? ( i have had numerous packages go ups to usps to p . o . box ) to make matters worst the shipment was short 2 packages of product . i think next time i will stay on the west coast for faster delivery and a little extra $ $ $ $ . good luck if you order from gristedes market in new york ! ! ! ! ( and , remember to stay on top of the order to make sure that you actually get it . . . . . ) the one positive note was that the product was awesome as far as freshness and presentation ! ! !

good value , well packed the assortment is a large box - - - the individual 8oz bags are much larger than they look in the photo . with the bonus bag , the assortment comes out to 5 1 / 2 pds of coffee for $ 40 ( subscription price at the time of this writing ) , which works out to a an economical $ 7 . 27 per pound - - and that doesn't even count the mugs . the mugs are well - designed , light and fit nicely in the hand . yeh , i know they are just mugs , but i have dozens of mugs , many of which are unnecessarily heavy and / or hard to hold . but these are above average , in a functional sense . although the bags look like kraft paper , in fact they are metalized - plastic inside , sealed air - tight , and re - seal air - tight easily and securely . they even have a valve so you can squeeze out excess air , which is a good thing to do . the presentation box is utilitarian but nice - - - the sampler would make an excellent gift for any coffee lover , even a wedding gift . the selection is sumatra mandheling , costa rican tarrazu , columbian supremo , breakfast blend , french roast , dark house blend , italian dark roast expresso , french vanilla , hazel nut , and decaf columbian . unfortunately , not the selection i would make if i had a choice . the full 8 - oz " free sampler " was city roast colombian , but presumably other varieties may be substituted for the " free sample " . honestly , i'd prefer another bag of coffee rather than the mugs , and i wish i could have the option of a " no - decafinated no - flavored " sampler . but , the french vanilla and hazelnut are not too objectionable , and one can always save the single decaf bag for evenings . ironically , you can purchase an all decafinated sampler coffee bean direct assorted whole bean decaf coffee sampler , 9 - pound box , or an all flavored sampler coffee bean direct assorted flavored whole bean coffee sampler , 9 - pound box , so why can't they offer a " no - decafinated no - flavored " sampler ? if you are a real coffee lover , i strongly suggest purchasing a mellita manual cone system , such as melitta cone filter manual coffeemaker 6 cup , 1 - count for some reason i cannot link to the " 10 cup " system , which i recommend . i'm working my way slowly though the coffees . i'll add updates as i go through them . note that such evaluations are strictly a matter of personal tastes , and quality may differ between batches . in general i prefer light roasts , and loath flavored coffee . based on c being " typical american coffee " : sumatra mandheling c + glad i didn't buy the 5pd bag i was consideringdark house blend bcosta rican tarrazu bbreakfast blend bcity roast columbian afrench roast b + columbian supremo b + be careful grinding the french roast - - - it has alot of sugar as a glaze ( not enough to taste ) . if you overgrind the coffee you apparently melt the sugar , and the powdered coffee and sugar sticks , like a turd , in your grinder . i use a wooden popsickle stick to scrape it out , but still it's annoying . i do not know why sugar is added to dark roasts during the roasting process , but it is common .

not the favorite , but passable of all the gormet fancy feast varieties , this one seems to be the least favorite . not sure why - they won't eat salmon fresh from the market either . must not be on the regular cat's palate for some reason . the smell is quite nice though - smells like people food really . you can't really go wrong with these fancy feast varieties - they're the hit in this house ! 
=================
taste's good i am an avid tea drinker ; drinking at least one cup a day . i was excited to try this product because of the passion fruit and aloe vera additions . i also appreciate the fact that i don't have to brew it , i can just remove from the refrigerator and enjoy . i liked the flavor of the drink . i even liked the aloe vera pulp , the consistency did not bother me , but i can see how it could be a deal - breaker for some . the tea - flavor was very light , as it is green tea ; if i did not know tea was the third ingredient , i never would have guessed . with cane sugar as the second ingredient , i could definitely taste that flavor and it left an after - taste in my mouth . i think the price is a little high for this product , when i can home - brew regular tea for pennies . while this does have the added health benefits , i can see buying occasionally , but not as a daily or even weekly drink . i did not like that it is packaged in a plastic bottle , i did not factor that into my rating , but usually i do not buy any drinks that come in plastic bottles . 
=================
wow ! couldn't believe pricing on this ! dh has tassimo & loves cappuccino but he recently switched to the latte's as pricing in local stores ( one with a t ) began rising after the recall . you can get the latte locally at that red dot store for $ 8 . pricing is almost comical .

medifast magic i purchased this syrup based on customer reviews and i have to agree - this is great stuff ! i used it on my medifast pancakes this morning and was 100 % satisfied with the texture and taste . i'm extremely sensitive to the sugar - free aftertaste that so many low calorie products have and this didn't bother me at all . i really don't think i'll use any other pancake syrup in the future . thank you walden foods ! 
=================
don't listen to the negative reviews ! i don't understand why other reviewers are complaining about the sugar content in this product . go to the website and see for yourself . this product has 1 gram of sugar per serving ! i don't understand how people think this stuff is " too sweet " . all i know is it sticks to the roof of your mouth like no other peanut butter ! 
=================
overpriced i love this coffee and was disappointed when they discontinued it for the tassimo brewers . i have since bought a keurig brewer , and was pleased to see the verona k - cups in costco yesterday for about $ 32 for this same 54 unit quantity . the price here is absurd . . . at this time . i'll wait until i see it on amazon in the $ 30 - $ 32 dollar range before ordering on amazon . 
=================
smells and works well . i like the smell of this stuff , though i don't know if that matters as i don't think the smell lingers long after washing . it also leaves me just as dandruff free as my usual brand . it feels slightly more oily than my usual brand and i suspect this is due to it being for dry scalp hydration . one thing about shampoo for me is that i usually look at the price and buy the cheapo because i never had a problem with the brand i buy . i have interchanged using them and its not like this leaves me feeling any better or worse than my usual brand . other than it feeling oily and smelling good when i use it , it pretty much does exactly the same thing my usual brand does . now , i have yet to see it in stores but i would assume it will be more expensive than my usual brand so its unlikely i will pick this up when i need more . if for some reason after i go back to my old brand i realize something or i miss something about this i will come back and update , but those are my feelings as of now . 
=================
review the product was ontime and the quality was extremely high . i have ordered this brand more than once .

perfect bouquet to insult the women in your life ! nothing says " make me a sandwich and bring me a cold one , you sl - ut " quite like a proflowers bouquet . until proflowers permanently terminates their association with rush limbaugh , i suggest you use a more reputable company or call your local florist . if you continue to support a company that supports this vile man , then your mother really should have held an aspirin between her legs ! do the right thing - - shop elsewhere !

miss ted wouldn't touch it ! we have a 5 year old mixed breed dog who weighs about 85 pounds on good days . frankly , she has had a rough time of it . she caught the very tail end of the dog food crisis , ended up with kidney problems that rear their ugly heads now and then , and has become the world's pickiest dog food eater . chances are good that if she will eat any given dog food , it is a 50 - 50 proposition as to whether or not her kidneys will act up . as a result , miss ted's people have tried any number of dog foods - the cheap stuff , the expensive stuff , the special diet stuff , the stuff from walmart , the stuff from the grocery store , the stuff from the pet store , the stuff from the vet , even the refrigerated stuff , so i was happy to be given a chance to try purina beneful original dog food , 15 . 5 - pound . the bag arrived beautifully packaged and unlike his normal habit of simply leaving things on the porch , the ups driver carried this all the way upstairs for me . ( i was very grateful . ) miss ted happened to be in one of her " that stuff is poison and i'm not going to touch it so i'll just eat the cat's food until i can get into the pantry for some real people food " mood , so her bowl remained untouched . we tried another half - dozen times over a period of 10 days or so and got the same reaction every time . the dog food looks fine and smells fine , but miss ted won't eat beneful - even if she hasn't eaten anything but the cat food in a couple of days . others have pointed out some of the controversy surrounding this particular dog food , as well as the low rating given to the product by the dog food advisor due to the high fat and carbohydrate levels . grandma's $ 0 . 02 : if you are feeding strays like grandma did out west , then this might be a good option and having the dog food delivered is a fantastic service . on the other hand , if you have a " special needs " dog , the is probably not the best option . your call .

garlic - stuffed olives i have tried many different brands of garlic - stuffed olives and of all of them the mezzetta brand is by far my favorite . i'm not sure what is it that the other brands do differently , but mezzetta uses very large green olives and the juice that they are stored in is probably what distinguishes them from others . if you have tried other brands and really didn't care for them that much , try this brand . i can't guarantee that you'll like them as well as i do , but they probably have a better chance of also being your favorite than most other brands . i could be wrong and there may be better brands , but i keep sampling every new brand that i come across and i just keep coming back to the mezzetta brand of garlic - stuffed olive . i go through at least one jar a month .

ignorance is bliss , hydrolized protein made using enzymes is not msg & you can buy these at w - mart for $ 144 . this is great formula , but despite scare tactics of whacko tree huggers who dropped out of school , the hydrolized protein in this formula is made through enzyme process which does not result in msg . there are 3 significantly different processes used in usa by mfg to hydrolize protein and just because one results in msg , does not mean all processes do . these same size and type formulas can also be purchased elsewhere for much cheaper and instantly with no shipping charges . check your local wallyworld .

good value when i bought last summer but no longer i've purchased a couple of cases of 20 ounce cokes in the past year . at that time , amazon was selling them so when they would have a sale , they were a great buy . unfortunately , amazon is no longer carrying them and , as you can see , the shipping cost from the vendor is more than what the cokes cost . as a result , instead of costing less than a dollar each ( great price ! ) , the shipping cost added in makes them cost about $ 2 . 00 each . outrageous ! the only reason i'm giving them 2 stars instead of one is because i love the taste of the product . . .

eb pears earth's best makes good baby food that my child likes . however , i am rating their product here as it is available through amazon . i'm very disappointed , like the other reviewer said , about the very short expiration date . a few days before i ordered this , the page said it wasn't in stock and that it would be available sept . 15th . i ordered on the 15th , and it arrived on the 17th as promised with the free 2 - day shipping . my case was supposedly the restocked pears , but the expiration date is nov 09 . new stock shouldn't have an expiration date that is only 2 months away , even if it is on sale ! in the grocery store , the expiration date usually is 1 or 2 years away . 
=================
not as satisfied . . . package was diff when product arrived i got sold on the product when i read the review and hope the only reason for the review was that people all over the world have different taste . the tea arrived in a package which does not match the picture . . . that's not a good start . the side of the package was not sealed and thus i believe the aroma compromised . i wish i had not purchased the tea from china misti actually tried another tea store in ny , ito en . they have an online store too , which you may want to try . i would easily give it five stars or more

salty there is nothing better then a salt & vinegar potato from lay's . they are very good . been eating them for years and still have not found a chip to replace them .

be aware . . . . this company - fast - pak trading inc . locates in new jersey . we used to buy honey they are distributing here in brooklyn for couple years now . manuka is our favorite , but in past year its price just skyrocketed , so we switched to kamahi and thyme . we love kamahi - it has distinctive taste , not as many american honeys we were trying for years . but ! ! ! last time we bought kamahi from the same fast - pak trading inc . in the local store - it was different honey ! although label says it's the same , but i know the taste and can say for sure - they put something different in the jar . it's more like clover honey , something cheaper and less tasty . so , be aware of it , when you're buying honey from this company . other than that - kamahi is great honey . 
=================
you have to love hulls i will say it is not overly salty or greasy and the taste is mild . when the kernels pop the hull is the most notable part . it's sort of like eating nuts with the shell still on . i also wasn't that impressed with the bag / bowl . everybody wants their popcorn to be hot but that very heat makes it hard for me to open properly . yeah , yeah , i'm a wimp . but think about your ten year old grabbing a baked potato without a mitt . apologies to those who love this product but i won't pay for it again . 
=================
waste of time , money and food is there any actual yeast in this ? i have used this many times from several different batches and purchased from different retailers at different times . it often comes prepacked as the yeast in pre - packaged bread mixes . each time i was careful to make sure that it was nowhere near the expiration date . in every case , the bread has failed to rise . this is worse than garbage as it ruins all the ingredients and you have to throw it all out ; there is little worse than needlessly wasting food . when it comes with the pre - packaged mixes , i have tried throwing out this branded " yeast " packet and replaced it with other brands of yeast . when i do this , the bread comes out perfectly . the bread is only ruined if i actually used this brand of yeast . bottom line , if you want to be disappointed and waste time , energy , money and food , then this is exactly what you want . update may 2012 : i have been experimenting with this brand of yeast by trying to activate in the following manner . take one packet ( about two teaspoons ) , add 1 / 4 teaspoon of sugar and 1 / 4 cup of water between 110 and 120 degrees . put it in a coffee cup and get it all nice and wet and wait about five minutes . red star brand and fleischmans ( regular and fast rising ) and the hodgson mill yeast in their bread machine mixes ( the only other ones i have checked ) yeast will rise and fill half the coffee mug . ( fast risers fill the whole cup ) this brands increases its volume by just a little . i have also found that red star ( regular , did not try the fast rise ) yeast that is more than one year past its expiration date performs nearly as well as the fresh stuff . therefore i can say with the confidence of empirical evidence that red star yeast that is more than one year past the expiration on the package performs better ( read : acceptable ) than the packets of unexpired saf yeast i have tried ( read : unacceptable ) . 
=================
salt and vinegar chips it was a great value and i like the package size but not vinegary enough for me . won't order this brand again . great chips otherwise . 
=================
not very moisturizing i have used a couple of clear brand products in the past and been very pleased with them , but i felt like this conditioner didn't condition well at all . i found myself using more and more every day trying to achieve the conditioning results i got with other brands . my hair is about shoulder length and when i was using about 1 / 3 of a cup daily and still finding my hair to be dry , i decided enough was enough and went back to my old brands .

urinary problems i feed my puppy this from age 2 months till 9 months and she began having urinary track problems . i spent a lot of money at the vet to figure it out but still have no answers other then switch her on hills . . . what a joke i bought into it and when i opened the bag of hills it smelled so bad . feed her that for 2 weeks ( poor girl ) then i got her on a raw diet that i make myself . everything is great now and she loves it . i recommend looking into a raw diet for your animals . google " raw diets for dogs " you and your pets will be much happier ! ! let's put all dog food companies out of business . . .

sugar free ? not quite . the switch kiwi berry , 8 . 3 ounce cans ( pack of 24 ) the switch kiwi berry is a nice beverage alternate to soda , however , it packs a whopping 33 grams of natural sugar in its 8 . 3 oz . single - serving can . i found the taste refreshing and not too sweet , but i am not a regular consumer of carbonated beverages . while this would be a fine alternative to sugar - added , preservative - laden beverages , it contains a high degree of carbs . also , the first and second ingredients are not kiwi or berry juice but apple and grape juice concentrates . if you're watching calories , the 135 in this small can might be better spent on real food . 
=================
not for me tastes too much like licorice . my 10 year old likes it with lots of sugar , nothing like black tea . this is a herbal tea from the mellow bush . i do drink herbal teas , and like them , however this one i dislike . there was no sothing vanilla for me . when the hot water hit the tea the strong scent of licorice came about . i still steeped and added agave and tried it . unfortunately all i could taste was licorice and i had to discard mine . i prefer these red rooibos teas . twinings of london african rooibos red tea ( pack of 20 ) davidson's organic tea south african rooibos , 100 - count tea bags
=================
eucalyptus oil , really ? my cats loved these treats . i loved these because they are cheaper than the cet brand , and neither of my cats had any trouble eating them . why the single star then ? well , because i can no longer give them to my cats in good conscience . they just recently changed the formula to include eucalyptus oil , which is toxic to cats . and it's listed not once , but twice . i have an elderly cat who has chronic renal failure , and there is no way i am giving her anything that is even the tiniest bit toxic . maybe if i had 2 young cats i would be less concerned , but as it stands , there is no way i will buy these treats again unless they change the formula back . i still have the packages from the last order i bought , and there is no eucalyptus oil anywhere in the ingredients . i have no idea what they were thinking when they added a well known toxin to their formula , but i will be buying the cet treats from now on . 
=================
cats went nuts for them after getting over their initial suspicion of the new food treat , my cats wanted more , more , more ! i was even suspicious at first because the treats seemed awfully hard . but once in kitty's mouth , the nibblet moistens a little and the cats just crunch away . 
=================
short - lived flavor ( compared to regular orbit gum ) i went through a piece of gum while writing this review - - maybe 5 - 10 minutes ? if you hate gum that gets stale quick , avoid this like the plague . if you're fine literally going through a pack a day ( or a pack every few hours , if you like to constantly chew gum ) , this isn't bad . pros : - great , fresh flavor : i love how intensely minty gum is - - the initial burst of flavor is comparable to an altoids mint . leaves your mouth feeling very clean . flavor is much more intense than regular orbit gum . cons : - short - lived : gum gets stale just as fast as those $ . 25 gumball candies . the wonderful flavor lasts about all of 30 seconds before it begins to dissolve into an unappealing , flavorless mass . you know that feeling when your gum tastes gross because it's so old , but you don't have anywhere to throw it away ? i get that feeling less than 10 minutes in . a regular individually wrapped piece of orbit gum could last me over an hour . - not tooth - whitening : that bit of advertising is a bit misleading . i don't think it doesn't anything to whiten teeth moreso than gum normally would - - just by nature of being sugarless and picking up pieces of plaque . if you were expecting some tasty tooth whitener , look elsewhere . this doesn't affect my opinion of the gum because i never expected it to , but just throwing it out there .

used to be better quality these are inexpensive rawhide bones . they were of decent quality up until the last batch i bought . the centers don't seem to be made with rolled rawhide any longer , but they seem to be a tube filled with rawhide scrap now . will not buy any longer unfortunately . they used to be a great buy . 
=================
flavors were not as good as i hoped originally . . . but . . . incredible customer service ! ! ! ! first class updated review as of jan 20 , 2012 : i originally ordered 2 sets of these syrups , one for myself and one for a friend so i would like to make this a two part review / explanation as we each had different experiences apparently . my experience : i enjoy the peppermint , however the eggnog and gingerbread flavors were not as good as i hoped , and they all ( minus the peppermint ) separated and are so thick they are near impossible to re - mix together ( which admittedly may be affecting the flavor . . . ) . i originally gave this a 2 star rating due to being unhappy with 2 of 3 flavors in the set . my friends experience : he was happy with the overall flavors , however was disappointed with the separation issue i mentioned above . however , based on my original review on amazon , the company contacted my friend via telephone the very next day ( they somehow got his phone # from the order , vs my account information ) . they were apparently very concerned with the product not being up to par , and even rushed him replacement syrups , reported to their internal r & d , etc . in summary , my review was 2 stars based on flavors , my friends is 5 stars based on customer service , so i am giving this a 4 star average review , as the company went above / beyond . 
=================
tastes great , but has toxic msg in it ! had to quit buying this once i discovered it contained msg ( monosodium glutamate ) . so sad . loved this dip , why do they have to make it so bad for you ?

great price and good product . . . the best and most reasonable brownie mix on amazon , plus i've ordered it at least 4 times from this site ( i do a lot of brownie baking during the holidays . . . ! ) and have never been disappointed . . . so i'm giving it 5 stars . . . i make what i call " deep dish " brownies . . . i use a 10 x 15 inch pan instead of the standard 9 x 13 and i double up on the brownie mix . . . two boxes per batch . . . to make a very thick and fudgy brownie that my nieces and nephews love at the holidays . . . if you want to try it , i suggest using 5 eggs for each batch ( instead of the 2 eggs per box x 2 boxes = 4 eggs . . . what the manufacturer recommends ) and lining the pan with reynolds non - stick parchment / foil ( reynolds wrap non - stick pan lining paper - 30 sq . ft , 1 each ) . . . you will love the outcome . . . . . . and a few other hints to please your brownie customers . . . try a batch or two mixed with candy . . . i've done m & m's ( plain and peanut ) , reese's pieces , and even several kinds of whole hershey's kisses mixed in . . . i've used regular kisses , the caramel - filled kisses , and even the coconut creme - filled kisses ( my personal favorite ) . . . forget those brownie mixes that claim they have " chocolate chunks " in them . . . if you want chocolate chunks in your brownies , put 'em in yourself . . !

flour's great - seller not walmart sells this flour for around $ 3 . 66 for five pounds . it's a terrific flour , but the seller is a rip off artist . heck , you can get it cheaper by buying from king arthur flour's website ! 
=================
beware deceptive advertisement ! though the product is first rate cat food , i must say i feel duped by the way the ad was written . the ad shows a six once can and the 24 cans sent were three once cans . going back to the ad i found that at no time do they mention the can weight they just had the big picture of a six once can . so buyer beware for i wont't do business with this seller again .

taco bell sauce the stuff is good , but don't think it's the best . the taste is a little bland compared to other sauces and doesn't really pack any heat to it at all . you would think " hot " meant hot , but this is more like mild to me . try again taco bell .

no fillers , lots of taste i was searching for a hot cocoa mix without high fructose corn syrup and other fillers . of the several options available at my grocery store this was the only one without a bunch of " junk " in it . i was hesitant at the price , but decided to try it . oh , what i have been missing out on ! absolutely divine ! you don't need to use as much powder as suggested by the package . for best results in stirring the powder in , heat the milk up until is hot ( not just " warm " ) . sometimes i will add the chocolate in , mix slightly , heat the mixture up to hot , and then finish mixing . the stuff in packets has always been a poor substitue for the " real thing " my mom used to make using cocoa powder , sugar , vanilla , etc . they are thin , watery , and not very chocolatey . to say nothing of the fillers added in . it's a little sad to see so many reviewers actually say they prefer that . more ghirardelli mix for me i guess ! : )

blueberries and cranberries my 14 year - old cat has had a serious bladder infection . i tried some of the powdered cranberry on her food , but no go . this is better . the can is a little larger than other avoderm cans and the food is softer , so sometimes mix it with something a bit firmer so she can pick it up more easily .

see my other review i reviewed the cat version of this product . my cats go berserk over this stuff ! the dog version is the same , just in bigger pieces . i break up the large pieces before giving them to my cats .

a bill of goods at a premium price wow , what ups with this water . the ph of the " still " water is 6 and the " sparkling " water is 5 . low in tds , total dissolved minerals , the purer the water the worst it is for your health . pure water with an acidic ph will actually rob the body ( actually your bones ) of valuable minerals in an attempt to neutralize the acidity . and the price for all this . . . let's see . for adequate hydration you should drink 1 / 2 of your body weight in ozs per day ( of healthy restructured ) water . so for a 150 person that's 4 . 43 bottles / day and that would cost you ( 24 pk of voss 16 . 9oz ) , . . . $ 7 . 18 / day , $ 215 / month or $ 2583 . 50 / yr . so this water that's not really any good for your health if you equate it's price per ounce to a gallon of gasoline , you would be paying $ 13 . 35 / gallon for your gas . educate yourselves to what's really going on . . . to find out more visit www . hydration - sense . com

good product - lousy shipping we love this product but the last time we ordered six bottles they sent in very poor packaging and one bottle was broke . even after complaints and a request for a new bottle - because it is not a cheap product - we did not get an answer or a replacement bottle ! ! it would be really nice for the company to at least reply to complaints !

she's eating them having a minipoodle diagnosed with allergies is no fun - - - when the allergy turns out to be chicken - - even more so . got these for shannie and at first whiff she said " no " . . . oh lord - is this special or what - - - - i have six boxes . then i offered a cookie to leo - - - he followed shannies lead , sniffed and said " no thanks " . broke cookie in half - offered half to each pupper and they gobbled them down ! looks like we have breakfast cookies ! weird puppies ! ! lol ( i must add - the box is full of crumbs , cookie dust and crumbles )

unfit for scooping tostitos scoops is a misnomer , these chips are unfit for scooping anything more than whipped cream . out of ten attempts to scoop my 7 layer bean dip with these chips , only two were successful . and out of those two success stories one of them ended poorly when the tostitos scoop broke in half and lodged itself in my palate . i am sticking with the frito lay scoops , while traditionally used for chili i think they would do a better job than these sorry pieces . 
=================
not as good a value for the $ $ as it appears i used these as rewards & i needed a large amount of them . the " subscribe & save " price was comparable to the sale price in the store , so i opted to have them shipped to me rather than make the trip to the store . all would have been well except that more than half of the 12 boxes had only 4 fruit rolls instead of the labelled 6 . not a good deal anymore ! i've cancelled my subscription & will likely not " subscribe & save " with any additional products . 
=================
great product . . . . . horrible shipping i have loved this product for years , and when i saw them on sale at amazon , i jumped and placed an order . it si very rare for amazon to mess something up , but they did this time . their shipping method reduced the cookies to shards and crumbs . you could never serve them in that condition . but they make a fantastic crust . lets face it , on this one item , amazon completely dropped the ball on shipping . 
=================
a little bit pricy wow i think this is a little on the steep side as far as price is concerned . over $ 4 a box at the $ 25 rate . shop the grocery .

one of two bottles was empty . . . i love extra virgin coconut oil . it's so different from other coconut oil . cold press is the best for your health and taste buds always . however in this particular shopping from amazon was unfortunate . one of two was empty . the glass container and seal weren't broken and the lid was just in the right place , but it was empty . i assume it happened before they packed because i didn't see the trace of the oil in the shipping box . i reported it and received refund quickly . i will order again when i finish the other one with content .

product of chile or mexico ? be aware that nestle usa recently switched supply of nido from their chile plant to mexico and the quality is like night and day . most if not all the previous 5 - star ratings were based on nido from chile were the quality of the milk is far superior than the mexican milk which is horrible !

energy plus mostly minus these energy plus candies are billed as " honey filled caramel drops " . each foil wrapped package contains nine small ( 1 " x 1 / 2 " ) rectangular candies that resemble european - style cough drops . the caramel outside is hard and when bitten into the soft honey filling oozes out . the caramel honey flavor is not bad , not scrumptious , just ok . the reason they are named " energy plus " is that in addition to sugar , corn syrup , milk , honey , butter , and natural flavors , the ingredients also include a middling amount of vitamins b6 , b12 , and c . each 20 calorie candy contains about 35 % of the daily recommended values ( based on a 2000 calorie daily diet ) of b6 , b12 , and c . now let's understand that is is not a food . other than 5g of carbohydrates and 5g of sugar there is no protein , no fiber , no fat , no cholesterol and no salt . this is a candy that has been fortified with three vitamins . one probably derives more of a sense of energy from the carbs and the sugar content rather than the b vitamins . it seems a better choice to have a really satisfying , tasty caramel candy werther's original creamy caramel filled hard candies , 5 . 5 - ounce bags ( pack of 12 ) and take a daily multivitamin centrum performance multivitamin , 60 - count than consume these . on a positive note , these candies are manufactured by ambrosoli in como , italy . if you've never visited beautiful lake como i highly recommend doing so . lake como & its surroundings ( travel adventures ) .

orange you glad ? i agree with the assessment of the original reviewer and i believe that this is a heinous crime against tic tac lovers across the world . the second reviewer is obviously not a true fanatic and will bend to the will of the corporate america . we will not stand for pre - sucked tic tacs , no matter their supposed creed , white is not what they should start out as . this is an outrage , and i , for one , will not stand for it . ps . ) walmart does not carry mega tic tac packs and they suck ( but not pre - suck ) , too .

new formula includes caffeine i bought 2 jugs of the 'new' grape cytomax . i read the ingredients information on the amazon site , but when i went to use the product i now notice that it has a different formula and includes caffeine . some people like that . others do not . regardless , this should be clearly disclosed by amazon . it is not . i can't comment on the taste as with caffeine i have dumped out the product - i don't want that for myself or my family .

title is a little misrepresentative assorted green tea flowers should be called assorted jasmine green tea flowers . it's the blooms that are assorted not the tea flavor . they are all jasmine . having said that , it's a wonderful surprise when you put in the bud and don't know what kind of flower you're going to be getting next ! usually when i buy jasmine tea i get the finest - a small 4 ounce bag that runs me $ 20 and although this tea isn't as good as what i regularly buy it's still very nice tasting . the best part is that it's practically impossible to overbrew . jasmine tea in particular can get really bitter easily if it is overbrewed even a bit and i was afraid i would have to take the flower out after a couple of minutes to stop the brewing process . but no ! the makers thought ahead and made it so that you can leave the flower in and it won't overbrew . the only bad thing about this is that if you like your jasmine tea really strong then you won't like the way this works for you . but strong jasmine tea is always bitter so you might want to try a lighter brew like this . hint : if you never liked the way jasmine tea tasted because of it's bitterness here's a trick . standard instructions for jasmine include having your water at around 180 degrees and brewing for aprox 2 minutes . instead of this , try using a lower temperature instead - say 130ish and brew for 7 minutes . what you'll get is a tea with all the jasmine and none of the bitterness . with these flowers however you don't have to worry about brewing time ( unless you like your tea very weak ) and are free to enjoy the flower until your tea is gone .

very tasty spread - would definitely get it again . we ordered two jars of the amish spreads , which arrived today . the seller packs carefully , and the jars arrived quickly and in fine shape . we anxiously opened them both with spoons in hand to enjoy . both spreads were very tasty . the apple blueberry is a definite keeper and i would buy it again without a blink . the cinnamon was a little heavy , but it was still very tasty . the cherry was a little too spicy in my opinion - it seemed again like there wastoo much cinnamon in it , to the point of overriding any cherry flavor . if i was tasting that one blindfolded , i am not sure i could tell it was cherry ! it was still very good , just not as " cherry - ful " as other fruit butters i've had . the spread looked lovely - you could see the cherries , but the taste was obscuredby the spices . note that i love cinnamon in all forms - in cookies , on toast , in spreads , in candy , in gum . so , i am not picking on it - it just seemed to be out of balance . now , i do want to mention one thing that bothered me a little bit . i saw no place or way that these jars were sanitarily sealed . in other words , there was no lid to pop up , no inner seal , no plastic seal on the edges . i am guessing that the jars are filled as orders come in , but it stillbugged me that the screw - on lids didn't seem to have any real seals . i would have liked to at least see those plastic heat - shrink seals aroundthe lids so i could have at least felt i was the first person dipping in the jar ! i did deduct one star for the lack of a visible sanitation process . the jar does say to refrigerate after opening . since there is no seal inside or out , i would refrigerate immediately upon receipt no matter what . so , i would recommend the apple blueberry butter . the cherry butter - well , i am going to keep trying other kinds .

sprouted well , but container too light it did as it was advertised ; in under a week i had a nice little container full of grass . two of my cats loved it , the third was not interested , but that is normal for her . the only complaint i have is that the container is too light . when one of the cats would try to chew off a stem , the container would lift off the ground , making it really hard for them to break the stem off . i ended up having to hold it for them , which means i can't just leave it out for them to nibble as they please . a note for kitten owners : my 5 month old kitten had trouble eating this , i think his teeth aren't spaced quite right yet to be able chew the stems off . i ended up tearing little pieces off and popping them in his mouth , which he was perfectly ok with , the lazy bugger . so if you're buying for kittens , you may want to hold off until they're grown .

this cat food has ended up being perfect for my cats i got two kittens back in oct 2006 . unfortunately the smaller one was always throwing up and had watery stools . after trying several other brands over several months with little improvement , i tried wellness core brand in jan 2007 due to the natural ingredients that seemed to be more like what a cat would naturally eat . both of my cats loved it and the smaller one stopped having stomach problems all together . i noticed that after they had been on the diet a while that their coats got very shiny . they've now been eating this food for over two years and are both active and healthy , with shiny coats and friendly dispositions .

birthday gift for my soldier i ordered two boxes of the treats for troopers snack package on april 13 to arrive for my soldier's 20th birthday on may 13 . as of may 15 it hasn't arrived and i'm a little disappointed that his birthday has come and gone without his little " party in a box " . as soon as i receive word that it has arrived i can post a better review . it's what he told me they most enjoy receiving while deployed in iraq for themselves . boxes of little toy animals is what they enjoy getting to give away to the kids . well it's almost christmas and the boxes never did arrive to my soldier . i'm out the money and even though the supplier assured me that they had sent it it never arrived . i asked my son if others were having difficulty in getting their mail and he said they were not . all i can assume is that after two attempts , this item was never actually shipped at all and my money is gone ! great birthday present for my 21 year old soldier , huh ? he is now safe at home , stationed in colorado . that was a great gift for me . i'll be seeing him for christmas . i won't be using this company to send him any more goodies .

good while it lasted . . . but it didn't last ! i started feeding my chocolate lab his dinner in this toy and it worked well . i really enjoyed watching him figure out how to dump this kibble out and he seemed to enjoying the challenge of getting every last piece out . he took to picking up the empty jug and dropping it , as if to ask for more food . . . and after 3 or 4 instances of this , the lid broke . if the lid were better protected from this type of damage i would definitely buy another one . it's not dog proof enough for us .

thai pavilion single serve spicy pad thai i have never tried this brand of food before i ordered this . nonetheless , i love spicy foods and especially oriental . the directions on the package are easy to follow and the packaging itself is awesome because it includes a fork ! also , there is no way the rice noodles can break unless someone perhaps sat on the packaging . having tried this just by itself there is not a whole lot of flavor going on , spicy flavor especially . there is at most a strong peanut flavor . i squirted a ton of sriracha hot sauce on this and that helped a ton in the flavor department . next time i'm going to make a stir fry with them which will just add more flavor and fill me up even more ! suprisingly , despite the lacking flavor , this is quite filling given the portion size . i don't know how much they cost in a grocery store because i've never saw them even while i worked in a grocery store for almost three years , but i say its worth it if you want to throw a curve ball in your home meals .

chicket noodle ( = ramen ) ? yeah , this is way expensive here in amazon . ( it's not yet imported by any of korean mart - at least , in chicago - but if so , price will go down . ) i'd like to describe the " what this is " - this is developed by a korean comedian ( kyung - kyu lee ) in a comedy show ( the show hosted korean ramen competition and he won 2nd prize ) - it's spicy + chicken stock ramen . it not " red spicy " but jalapeno spicy . i'm sorry to kko - kko myun , but you could make it with chicken bouillon , ramen - noodle , the white of egg and jalapeno ( optional chicken breast ) : - ) enjoy !

not bad i've never had a real appletini so i can't say whether or not this tastes like the real thing , but i thought it was pretty good . if i had not read the label and had no idea what flavor it was supposed to be , i don't think i could tell you . it definitely doesn't taste like apple juice or cider . maybe slightly like sour apple hard candies , only it's not sour . it's really pretty sweet . the color of the drink is bright green , so that's kind of fun . i can't say for sure that i'll buy this flavor again , but i will try the other crystal light mocktails . i'm always looking for new low calorie drinks to try .

was best trail - mix & healthly breakfast food after morning excerise this was 5 stars but now that amazon has decided not to carry and that the seller on amazon has doubled the price , i am lowering the overall score to 2 stars . i could see a 20 % increase , but 100 % gee . anyway , i now order this from staples . com at $ 25 less than current amazon seller . if price becomes more reasonable . i'd buy thru amazon's seller . but i must now change from 5 stars back to two stars , as this new pricing does not allow the product to get 5 stars from the current seller as priced . the technical and health value of my review below still applies . i enjoy planters trail mix , fruit & nut , 2 - ounce bags along with my bottle of cold water at least 4 early mornings every week . i order this specific trail mix and provide these individual servings to my other workout buddies as well ( great to have friends jog / walk together , insuring no excuses to sleep in ) . other buddies provide the water . we've all naturally lost excess weight over the last 2 years with our made - up program . this trail - mix has been a part of the equation of success with our healthful breakfast and exercise . this product's combo of dried fruit , including papaya , raisins , banana chips , pineapple , cranberries , along with mixed nuts makes this the best tasting and good - for - us trail - mix after our workouts . eating so well , after these pre - sunrise workouts puts me in the right frame of mind for the rest of the day and has helped me stay focused and eat well at lunch and dinner . i sometimes eat one of these as an afternoon snack too . one small warning : under amazon subscribe and save , i do have to often order this version of trail mix at least 20 days in advance before running out of my supply as this trail - mix must be popular to other amazon consumers as well , as this specific product is often backordered on amazon . bottom line , i've tried many trail mixes and this is the brand + mix that is the best combining a great mixture of dried fruit along with mixed nuts .

a great product ruined by misguided marketing i have used this formerly terrifc product for over 10 years . it was the only canned chicken sold in north america that contained no food additives . it was just chicken , water , and sea salt . as of this month ( march 2011 ) new labelling and contents have appeared . the label now proclaims " better flavor " . the product now contains 50 % more sodium - at a time when many manufacturers are either cutting back on salt content or introducing " reduced sodium " vesions of their tradtional products . worse yet , the " better flavor " is achieved by adding " rice starch " , " vegetable starch " ( a call to the company revealed that this is potato starch ) and " chicken broth " - which contains , among other listed ingredients , " natural flavor " ( derived from corn - an increasingly common food allergen ) . this product is now useless to me as i am highly sensitive to corn products . while the label still claims the product is gluten free , which was pretty much guaranteed before , since it had only chicken water and sea salt in it , this claim is now somewhat suspect in as much as with the introduction of each new additive , there is the possiblitly of cross contamination in the prodution of the various grain based starches and " flavors " the company needs to re - think this change . what made them unique and a mainstay for people on specialized diets , was their plain and simple good food . now they are little differnt from every other canned meat that is adulterated with unecessary and unwanted food additives . they can kiss goodbye all their former customers who are allergic to or sensitive to corn , processed starches , who are on the atkins or no grain diets , who have arthritis which is exacerbated by potatoes , and who avoid processed food additives in general . the company also needs to be more up front in their new labelling and say " potato starch " rather than " vegetable starch " and in bold print say " contains corn " to warn customers who are allergic to corn products that they probably should now avoid the product . hopefully this " better flavor " change will be about as successful as new coke " and we will see valley fresh " classic " chicken in a year so .

fantastic organic evoo first , let me point out that you should get 2 bottles of this oil and it is not " light " olive oil . it is extra virgin and organic . the taste is smooth with a bit of peppery finish . it is certainly a bit pricey so i am not using it as a general cooking oil . i use it for salads , drizzling on tomatoes and broiling , and if i ate bread , i'd mix this with garlic and herbs and black pepper - - yum ! hope you enjoy it : ) by the way , when i got my order , it only had one bottle and as i bought it thinking it was " light " , i was really disappointed . but the customer service from baker's box was excellent . they let me keep the bottle and refunded my money , since it is not the product as advertised .

their prunes are great , but their wild salmon with veg is terrible ! these are delicious , nicely packed , best i know . gotta mention at the same time that their wild salmon with veg was like old canned tuna , very tough , and really inedible . of course this could have been a bad batch , and i could have sent it back for a replacement , but who has time ?

works fine , but smells bad this stuff seems to protect me as well as the other clinical strength anti - perspirants that i've tried . however , the smell reminds me of an old cosmetic or something that i would find in my grandmother's bathroom . there is no joke intended there , i swear that this is the same scent . my girlfriend agrees , it smells like a grandmother . the smell is not overly strong , so it's not a gigantic problem , just something to consider before buying . i would recommend smelling it at the store before ordering .

not organic . . . i have been consuming seeds for years . i grind flax and sesame seeds in coffee grinder and add cocoa with soy milk for high mineral contents and antioxidants which is a necessity for my healthy diet . organic is the best for me and i am amazed why bob does not carry one since i consume bob's quinoa , flax seed , etc . and all those are organic . i consumed one bag of this then immediately changed to organic years ago . what is so disturbing is that not only bob will not produce the organic but his followers / ( possibly associates ) will rate anyone who says anything true but not favourable negative . talking about politics . wow . . . i will consume organic regardless of story line that bob gives on the phone .

the vision of the pomegranate . . . my ship and i , ( the h . m . s . peregrine cavendish named after the 12th duke of devonshire ) , were traveling the bay of bengal in the summer of 1938 . king george iv , had taken reign the winter prior . his royal majesty from the house of windsor still had a tentative grip on the british colony of india . hearken back to olden days of yore when imperialism was a goal , and not a mangy politicians word . we were making headway up the hooglhy river into calcutta under the guise of his majesty's royal trade mission with peace offerings to the maharaja of bengal . calcutta was a dicey place round about that time , being our capital in colonized india you know . the locals had grown weary of the legendary british hospitality . a fortnight later , it was near the mouth of the hooglhy river that we met a blind street beggar who promised us visions of prosperity . at first we questioned this diminutive cheeky fellow , but alas , we listened to his tale . we offered the blind beggar six british royal pounds in exchange for his gift of visions of prosperity . and that is when it happened . the blind beggar offered us this strange , yet edible fruit . " eat the fruit of this pomegranate " , the blind beggar said , " and the visions of your prosperity will come to light " . for good penance , the blind beggar gave us seven pomegranates for our continued journey . boson's mate micklegal , a fine purveyor of english tea's , and the second most knowledgeable of my sailor's had a unique idea . boson's mate micklegal decided to steep some loose black tea leaves with blueberries we picked up from our travels along the coast of palestine along with the strange edible portions of the blind beggar's pomegranate . much to our extreme delight , what an explosion of flavor ! i informed boson's mate micklegal that he was definitely on to something . while this delicious concoction was certainly no earl grey ( as any honorable britain would tell you , there's no comparison to " the earl " ) , it was certainly divine , chamomile be damned ! though summer's on the bay of bengal were most treacherous , with a cup of blueberry and pomegranate tea by your side while fixing the braggywinkle's on the bowline , the fresh smell of the salty air on your lips , a better day one cannot achieve . unfortunately , boson's mate micklegal found a bottle of glen fiddyich stowed away in one of the hold's . boson's mate micklegal ended up getting pissed off the fine scotch and forgot his wonderful concoction . in his plastered stupor , boson's mate micklegal heaved the six remaining pomegranate's off the aft deck of the h . m . s . peregrine cavendish , losing the wonderful recipe forever . what rubbish . until the hack tea makers at the lipton company devised their own version of blueberry pomegranate tea . while not as divine as the tea boson's mate micklegal concocted in that summer of 1938 , they came darn bloody close . cheers lipton ! thanks for the memories .

wrong bag pictured just an fyi to other customers : this item is for the beef and ocean fish formula which is in a red bag . in my haste , i purchased this thinking it was a the 15lb version of the chicken and rice formula . woops ! so i went and bought the 15lb bag of chicken and rice and mix the beef and fish in so it didn't wreak havoc on my pup's digestive system . i can say that after we started feeding this to my pup , she starting having stinky farts and had never had them before . also , roshan's right about the fish breath ! ick . overall , my dog has no issues with this formula , it's just stinky so i'll stick to chicken and rice after this bag is done .

flavor without sodium i add a bit of this and / or other blends of mrs . dash before or during cooking a variety of dishes . a little often goes a long way , but it adds flavor without sodium . i can't help but wonder if the review stating that it was " horrible " was based on using too much and perhaps especially if this , rather than the table blend , was shaken onto already prepared foods .

loved by dog ; approved by owner my ten - year - old dachshund loves these ! how much does he love them ? two weeks ago , he hid under the bed and whined . i took a packet of these treats and began opening the packet , he ran out from under the bed in anticipation and into the kitchen . my miniature dachshund is fed the very best of homemade organic diet ( a take on the spot - stew diet ) . he is not a picky eater but will rarely go crazy for treats that are not home - made . the reason i like newman's organics is because finding organic lamb to incorporate in my dog's diet is impossible . finding organic lamb meat is almost as hard as finding unicorn meat . these treats allow diversity in his food ( he usually gets chicken , turkey , or tofu with oatmeal or brown rice and a variety of vegetables ) . the ingredients listed on these treats are organic barley , organic lamb , organic carrots , organic apples , organic palm oil ( preserved with mixed tocopherols , a source of vitamin e ) , organic molasses . the analysis listed on these breaks down as follows : crude protein - 9 . 0 % min , crude fat - 4 . 0z % min , crude fiber - 4 . 0 % max , moisture - 11 % max . i'd definitely say these are dog and owner approved !

i actually love this product - but what a mistake i made - size ! ! ! i truly love bassett's jbs ! ! ! ! if you buy them , and you love sweet jelly candy - you'll love these guys ! however , i bought the item thinking the package was the bag about 3 times this size - mistake . this package is 215g which weighs 1 / 2 pound . $ 20 for a pound of these is a complete rip ! ! ! ! this item actually sells for about $ 3 in stores where you can find this english treat . be careful - unlike me .

go with the tv cooks on this one i still have one of these sitting around from way back when whole nutmeg was only known in culinary schools . nutmeg is particularly notorious for losing its flavor quickly when ground , so all cooks who use nutmeg regularly know that you have to use the nutmeg minutes after you grind / grate it . from this standpoint , it is better than the ground nutmeg every big - brand spice vendor under the sun sells - - which is to say , it's better than sawdust . the moment i decided never to use plastic spice grinders again was when i made some pumpkin pie with this stuff , because one of the first things i noticed was that i could feel the bits of nutmeg in the final product , kind of like tiny corn cob bits . i also noticed that while the nutmeg flavor wasn't completely gone , it wasn't as strong as it was when we first bought it , because this is filled with chunks of nutmeg rather than whole nuts - - that increases the surface area and the rate of loss of volatile flavor compounds . this stuff works okay in things like oatmeal cookies , where you're not going to notice the texture of the rather coarsely ground nutmeg . but for anything else , you're best off doing what the tv cooks do , and getting whole nutmeg and a grater like this microplane stainless steel zester and just grating a little off into the dish you're making . the flavor will be stronger , there won't be any grit from the nutmeg , and you will have a nice tool for other tasty things like citrus zest and parmesan cheese . plus , you can easily find whole nutmeg now online or in some brick - and - mortar markets .

great drink , awful price i love this drink , but be warned , the price here ( $ 53 ) is nearly double that of a regular grocery store in the us ( $ 30 ) . sometimes they're on sale for even less .

old things may be better ? to avoid all the chemicals and sugar in all the newer sweeteners like splenda . . . i was advised to go back to saccharin . . . . it's very very sweet . . . a half tablet , and they are small , is enough for one cup of tea .

must have for my dogs i love the c . e . t . chews for my dogs ! i have chihuahuas and shih tzus . both breeds have mouth shapes that are a challenge to find a chew that they will / can use . the c . e . t . chews are not uniform in size and thickness but because of the different mouths here that is a plus . for the very aggressive chewers here i give the thickest of all to . for the guys with the smaller mouths that don't chew very much i use the thinnest chews . i have read many reviews about how to cut these chews to smaller sizes to fit the dog . one was to soak the chew in water to soften it but it would remove some of the good qualities of the chews and i didn't like that . i tried to cut them by holding them with pliers and using a hacksaw . well that was nuts and just didn't work . finally i decided to try a pair of new tree branch loping shears to cut the chews and found success at last . this way i don't have to have so many bags of different sizes . i do have a very spoiled chihuahua here that will not use any of the chew toys i provide . his month is very tiny which would make cleaning with a tooth scaler hard plus he gets upset if he has to stay at the vet . these chews are the only thing he will chew at all to get tarter off his teeth .

shipping makes these much more expensive than grocery store great crackers . but for those who say these are cheaper than at their store they probably weren't including shipping . shipping to me made these $ 4 . 40 for each package . our local and very expensive grocery store sells them for $ 4 .

senseo pods generally good we have a decaf drinker and a regular coffee drinker in the house , so we have preferred the pod brewers for some time . basically , we have been pleased with the senseo coffee pods . they make a quite good cup of coffee . only downside i see is that a full cup requires two pods where , for example , melitta required only one . haven't worked it out but i think that makes a cup of coffee a bit more expensive with the senseo machine and pods . that's a small price to pay ( no pun ) given the fact that the machine for the melitta pods repeatedly failed and had to be replaced quite often . * * * update - february 2012 . last order had two bags with pods that were not correctly sealed and spewed coffee grounds throughout the bag . to make it worse , in each bag there were at least three defective pods . this increases the cost of a cup of coffee considerably ( over 15 % ) .

look elsewhere . . . i'm a fan of most energy drinks , but no fear's super energy is not impressive . each can contains two servings , each serving being 130 calories and 33 grams of sugar , and only 90 milligrams of caffeine . for me that is a lot of empty calories and not a whole lot of " energy " to be honest with you . taste wise it's actually quite pleasant . drink it super chilled or iced and it's refreshing . energy wise , it's not even close to my standard celsius or guru that i drink . if you're not too concerned about calories and want something a bit different than coffee in the morning , give it a shot . if you're wanting some energy and not a bunch of sugar , i'd recommend taking a look at the two products mentioned above .

nothing broken i was little hesitant ordering this since people were talking about receiving smashed bottles , but i couldn't pass up the deal . i received mine in speedy time and the bottles were all individually bubble wrapped and inside a plastic thing and then inside the box . nothing was broken at all and the extract is amazing !

instruction translation problem solvers when i lived in germany i bought this all the time over there . the biggest problem was of course everything was written in german . since you have a computer just go to a translation website and scan in the instructions and have them changed to english . from there you can use the product .
