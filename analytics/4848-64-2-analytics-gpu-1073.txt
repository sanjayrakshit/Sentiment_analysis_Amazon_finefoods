not as good as the first time the first time i purchased one of these packs , i got a really nice variety of coffees . the second time , i got virtually no " regular " coffee . . . just a ton of flavored coffee and unusual flavors at that . 
=================
flavor or function ? ? ? this coffee has great rich flavor and is very bold . . . my three star rating is because 90 % of the k - cups i received have failed either creating a huge mess , or they fill my cup with grounds and coffee , or they just don't finish properly . i can put another brand of k - cup in and it works every time . in fact today i had the second successful brew out of 45 so far . . . only 5 more chances to improve . i will not be ordering this particular flavor again . 
=================
would buy again - - with caveats ah , the sensual taste of black truffles . this salt includes generous bits of black summer truffles , not winter truffles , but that's good enough for me . at least you know that you're getting actual truffle substance , in contrast to truffle oil , which often contains synthetic compounds ( truffle " essence " ) . i received this package last night and already sprinkled this truffle salt on mashed potatoes and on a veggie burger . i'm looking forward to adding this to my scrambled eggs every morning and creating a blend with unsalted butter . as far as the truffle salt itself goes , i only wish that this were available at an even higher concentration than 10 % . the main problem is the packaging . the lid does not keep in the beautiful aroma of truffles - - i don't mind the smell in the kitchen , but all that wonderful flavor won't end up in the food . i've portioned out some in a camping ( screwtop ) salt shaker so that i can keep the main stash in a ziploc bag . but to reiterate , the lid itself is really a bad packaging job . in fact , the jar was open when it arrived ! i'm not sure whether to blame the manufacturer or amazon , but this meant the truffle salt spilled all over the inside of bubble wrap and the cardboard box . i recovered most , feeling somewhat pathetic about the effort , but this is expensive stuff and easily 10 % to 20 % of the product got lost in transit . i guess that tells you how good the stuff is . 
=================
tastes great , price is ridiculous these taste good , however i get them at about half the price at a local organic store . i am surprised they charge so much on amazon . 
=================
candy great , packaging and amazon's handling abysmal we are scheduled to receive a bag of raspberry gummis once a month . today we received the candy for the second time with the bag slit and the candy throughout the box . the box contained other items . it was evident that whoever packed the box knew the bag was slit and tried to conceal it by putting it upside down and thus guaranteeing that all the candy was contaminated . 
=================
what ? is it really ten dollars a bottle ? ! did people really pay ten dollars a bottle ? trying to get up to 20 words here . . . 
=================
smaller size received when i placed my order for this tea , size was listed as 227 grams . what i received was the smaller 120 gram size . i see now that the size has been removed from the item description . i'm sure the tea itself is fine , it is sealed and arrived in timely fashion . i purchased two of these for hostess gifts , and now have to supplement with something extra because of the smaller size . 
=================
juicy , but not like chicken . with a name like frichik , you'd expect that this would resemble chicken , right ? well , not to me . while the nuggets are similar in shape to the formed mcnuggets , the taste is much more like a juicy beef meatball or meatloaf . sodium is high here , so it may not be a good choice as a regular meal , with when i have a case of them , it's hard to make them stretch - they're a favorite . they're packed in a rather unappealing liquid , that i make sure to drain and rinse off . others have claimed to have a use for this liquid , but i've not found anything i've liked . 
=================
you gotta like fish what can i say , it tastes like fish . like really fishy fish . texture is ok , salty , but not overly salty , but it is what it is , fish eggs . 
=================
works ? the " trap " didn't catch any moths . . . must not be any to catch . that's good news , but even if it had trapped a moth the damage would have been done by the larvae . this trap just alerts one to the moths . 
=================
this food can be found for much , much less at petco i can not believe what a scam this is ? this is expensive high quality food however it can be purchased for half the price or more at local pet centers like petco , which is not inexpensive retail in my opinion . please beware and shop around ! 
=================
1 ingredient - no added sugar or preservatives ! i first tried coconut water in a can w / a spanish label . that particular brand was very tasty . . . and i knew it was too good to be true ! this water doesn't compare . it's much more pure and you can clearly tell the difference . 
=================
little too sweet for me i love coconut water . i've tried a lot of them . one , zico , vita coco , amy & brian etc . . this one imo is too sweet for me . the version with the coconut pulp is a little less sweet . i liked that one better . 
=================
it's ok coffee , but it doesn't go very far . . . as others have commented , it's decent coffee . a bit light tasting , but a decentchange from time to time . my only real gripe is that you only get 5 or so pots of coffee per can ( i generally make a full standard size pot when i brew coffee ) . sort of makes this " joe " a little pricy unless you catch it for a decent sale price . 
=================
not the real one again : - ( of course , the problem that we have , my wife and i , is the fact that we are belgians and lived the first 25 years of our lifes in liege ( born and raised ) . so when i get pearl sugar online for our liege waffles , like this one , pretending to be " belgian pearl sugar " ( it's written on the box ! ) , we can only be disappointed . i guess it's good enough for those who never been in belgium or those who just passed by there . . . those swedish made pearl sugar - at least they are not the rocky sugar - are too big , melt during cooking , give a taste of caramel instead , making the waffle chewy . oh well . . . i'm sure one day we'll find the real belgian pearl sugar somewhere online . . . 
=================
beware : look at best before date before using ! i love the product , but the stock the amazon sent me was about 8 months passed the best before date stamped on the box . make sure that your product is fresh and safe for consumption by verifying the best before date ! 
=================
safety concerns my dog absolutely loves these and she is very picky however i am returning them due to the numorous recent cases of illnesses and deaths occurring from chicken treats that have been manufactured in china . it is not worth the risk to me , sadly to say i will have to find another brand . 
=================
not bad at all . . . but heat it well ! like the lasagna , this product is relatively thick and has flavor . it needs to be heated well or it will taste like mush . i found the noodles to be a bit mushy , but there was plenty of meat and a tangy sauce . 
=================
mostly applesauce , not really carrot if you want applesauce with a bit of carrot flavoring , this is the one for you . if you're expecting carrot puree , skip it . on the other hand , the price is pretty good for an organic product . 
=================
very low gi food we have been eating cooked cracked wheat ( boiled for 20 mins ) two times a day from last 4 months . it is far better than white rice or bread . 
=================
not your mother's maxwell house it's not yuban , but it's not bad . it's also not the maxwell house that became famous as the watery church basement coffee of days gone by . it's got a robust flavor that surprised me , and no after taste to ruin it . better than average brew for a rock bottom price . it's just what american needs right now - - a decent cup of coffee that's not a budget - buster . bravo , maxwell house . 
=================
slightly burnt taste - i got this after dr oz recommended it . i will try anything to help me loose weight . . . it had a slightly burned taste and i havent used much of it . it might be a good substitute for brown sugar in some recipes . . 
=================
get tired of it so easily since it's a pack of 12 , i have no many in the closet but the taste isn't encouraging after having 2 packs . 
=================
celsius " yes " , but orange flavor is a " no " for me i started drinking one 12 ounce can of celsius 15 minutes prior to weight and cardio workouts , and have found celsius brand to be far superior to monster in the energy boost it gives me . each 12 ounce can has 200mg of caffeine ( check out the celsius website . . . ) so i don't drink any coffee on the mornings i'm off to the gym as when i do drink both , i tend to get jittery instead of 'boosted' . celsius' fat burning claims come from the thermogenesis angle . meaning it will keep your metabolism fired up for a longer period of time ( up to 3 hours post - workout ) and thus you can potentially burn up to 100 extra calories . it has ginger , chromium and green tea - all favored for their 'fat burning' properties , along with high vitamin c and b vitamins . no sugar , no carbs , no preservatives , no high fructose corn syrup , no trans fats and very low sodium ( 6mg ) make this a good energy drink choice in my book . this flavor however , makes me want to gag ! orange flavor is a 'sparkling' version of celsius . slightly carbonated , it could taste like a soda - fresca would be the closest thing to it in my mind - but for me it simply tastes bitter and tough to swallow . i do generally like orange flavored drinks , so this surprised me . i also found i had an upset stomach after drinking it . i do like two of the non - sparkling celsius drinks and would recommend you try a few flavors before buying a case of them . my favorite so far is celsius® , raspberry acai , 12 ounce cans ( pack of 24 ) and if i can't find that one , i'll drink celsius® , peach mango , 12 ounce cans ( pack of 24 ) . neither tastes bitter to me , nor overly sweet . there is no aftertaste and my stomach tolerated them well . one thing to note when using this supplement , it does seem to act as a diuretic . i have to urinate a lot for several hours after drinking just one . they say on the website that you can drink up to 3 a day ( that's 600mg of caffeine a day . . . ) and do not recommend this drink to anyone who is 12 or under , or caffeine intolerant . check out their website for studies relating to fat loss and this product . 
=================
gerber 2nd foods chicken and gravy my baby is ready for some new foods in her diet so i decided to give gerber 2nd foods a try . maybe i don't really understand how each is defined but gerber 2nds is vastly different from the other brands of 2nd baby foods that we have tried . the other brands seem to be similar in consistency . there is really no difference in the consistency of gerber 1sts and 2nds . the difference is that 2nds includes turkey , chicken and beef and 1sts are all fruits and veggies . my baby did not find gerber 2nds appetizing . the color and odor of the chicken is also nothing like actual chicken . i placed the lid back on the jar and refrigerated the jar since i was hoping to try it with her for another meal . the next day i got the gerber 2nds jar from the fridge and reheated it . when it was reheated the food was so runny that she could have drunk it from a bottle . the consistency does not keep from one day to the next . if you're looking for a baby food with chicken , turkey , or beef then i would recommend that you try beech nut stage 1 . my baby loved the beech nut turkey , chicken , and beef . the only problem is that the major grocery stores in my area do not sell beech nut . next trip that i make i plan to stock up on the beech nut ! 
=================
my 3 won't eat it . bought this food because it is healthy . good thing i only purchased a small bag to try . will go back to my merrick bc . they do like that one . 
=================
find other options i am on a gluten - free diet , and generally i like glutino brand foods . however , these breakfast bars are truly horrible . i even passed them out to 4 other co - workers who after a few seconds of chewing spit them out . if this is my only option for a breakfast bar , then i will just have to find something else to eat . yuck ! 
=================
just what i was looking for ! my 5 month old is teething and putting everything in her mouth . she is simultaneously showing interest in food . i was looking for something that would satisfy all of her needs and this is it . although this is made in china , i felt confident about buying it because it is organic . the crackers are crisp and textured so they provide teething relief . however , once they get really wet they dissolve , so there's no choking risk ! this plus is also a minus because if your baby is messy and gets this everywhere , clean up before they dry because they dry like cement chips ! 
=================
cost vs caution dog owners beware ! although most dogs like these treats ( and they are a good price for the amount you get ) , please use caution . smokehouse , a chinese exporter , was involved in the massive contaminated treat and food recalls last year . if you can't afford the healthier and safer free range treats ( such as lamb ears , kneecaps , tendons , etc ) , you can instead find some great recipes to make your own dog snacks . or buy a kong and shove some doggie snacks in it , or smear a dab of natural peanut butter in it . . . it will keep your dog busy and is good brain stimulation . if you absolutely must buy these smokehouse treats , be sure to check the container for bugs . the last one i saw had some of the most disgusting gray beetle - looking bugs crawling into and around the treats in the jar . also , keep your empty container ( or at least the label ) for a couple months in case your dog does get sick . 
=================
they taste like boogers if you don't like the sound of a salty , vinegary ice pop , this isn't for you . but if you like the sound of frozen boogers , go for it . 
=================
terrible cat food i bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and i enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials . my cats did eat this food , in fact they really enjoyed it . however , after reading the ingredients and doing some research , i completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats . the first three ingredients are ( which indicates the most prevalent ingredients ) are ground yellow corn , corn gluten meal , and chicken by - product meal . how disgusting is that ? ! the main ingredient is a cheap corn filler . one thing my vet told me a while back that i never forgot : " when you eat corn , what comes out of the other end ? the same thing happens with cats and dogs . " basically , corn cannot be fully digested , it is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full , poop out more ( more for us to clean in the litter box ) , and retain less nutrients . the only meat in friskies at all is a by - product , its not even a real meat ! by - products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested . we're talking beaks , chicken feet , eyeballs , even chicken poop ! i would not recommend this product to anyone , for any reason , ever . it is an absolutely awful cat food . i suppose you get what you pay for . i think the only reason why it was cat - approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats and because i usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy . i recommend to stay far away from friskies , as it is simply a very low quality filler food . even though the price is quite inexpensive , your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food , because they will never feel full . cats need to eat meat , and there just isn't real meat in this food . when purchasing a cat ( or dog ) food , the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients ; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself . now that i know what to look for , i usually buy my pets all natural , dry foods such as blue buffalo , halo or wellness . all of those brands contain real , whole meats that i myself would eat , with no added fillers or corn . 
=================
catches more than fleas i first started using the victor ultimate flea trap when i lived in california because we had a problem with sand fleas coming in our back patio screen door . we also didn't want to use any pesticides , since we had four small house pets . when we moved to michigan , we continued using the traps because our child was born , and we felt even more strongly about avoiding pesticides . although we did not have a flea problem , the traps have caught several types of spiders , the occasional house fly , a few random creepy crawlies , and even a hornet ! basically , they seem to trap anything attracted to the light / heat . we keep them tucked away , out of sight ( ex : in a back corner of our furnace room , under furniture ) , and in places where the pets can't get too curious - - getting a refill stuck to your skin ( or dog fur ) is the absolute worse . all in all , i think we've been using these traps for nearly ten years now . the bulbs can be replaced with regular night light bulbs or the new led bulbs . 
=================
stick a fire hose in my mouth ! i tried this at a friends house during a church function . while everyone else played games i sat at the table eating lemon bars to put out the fire . it's incredibly hot so i got some for my mother in law and we shall soon see if she's the hot sauce champion she thinks she is ! lol . update ! my mother in law tried it and she hates it ! lol . big surprise , i told her to give it to me because i love the stuff . . . . 
=================
don't pay this shipping fee ! ! a very high quality , palatable food . one of the * only * dry dog foods that all of my chis will eat . the shipping charge on this stuff is outrageous - almost as much as the food itself . go to www . artemiscompany . com and enter your zip code . they locate a store near you where you can buy it . most pet food stores charge about $ 50 for a 33 lb . bag . save the $ 36 shipping fee for something else . . . toys and treats , perhaps . or donate what you saved to your local rescue organization or shelter . if you can't buy it near you , other vendors ship it for about half what these guys charge . 
=================
liquid lollipops this 8 . 3 fl oz can packs a walloping 135 calories . switch's can claims that it contains no added sugar or corn syrup and provides 100 % of one's daily vitamin c ; it is made with 100 % juice plus carbonation and is all natural . this drink cloyingly sweet and tastes like a kiddie drink ( think dissolved lollipops ) . i prefer getting my vitamin c from orange or grapefruit juice . lots of fruit juices are available that are natural , e . g . , cranberry , apple , etc . 
=================
great in theory , not in practice there is a reason orville made it big . . . big kernels are easy and fun to eat . small lady finger kernels aren't . the popcorn tastes great , pops good , and i don't get any husks in my teeth . the problem is that because the kernels are so small it is almost a chore to eat . 
=================
still has bpas i bought this because of the dire reports about how unsafe canned tomato products are - something called bpa on the can interiors is leached into the tomatoes because of their high acidity . after i saw that the tubes were metal i emailed amore to ask about bpa . i give them much credit for repsonding but it turns out these tubes also have bpa so they are no safer than the cans . i will say this tomato paste tastes better ( but not way better ) than what i get in cans but i don't think it's worth the extra cost . i get three small cans for a buck at dollar general and theirs has no added salt which to me makes the dg brand a smarter choice . if the amore was organic then i'd say it was worth the cost but it isn't . 
=================
my puppy says it's delicious , but she also says it hurts its tummy : ( ground yellow corn , corn gluten meal , animal fat preserved in mixed - tocopherols and soy : be very careful of these ingredients . if you spot them in any dog food , it's a giant red flag . it seems a lot of dog food these days just have to have them . my dog absolutely loved this brand , but at the moment , i am treating this bag as a treat , just like we give chocolate to kids . we know they aren't really good for your health , but i am hoping giving them once in a while won't hurt them too much . go with certified brands like canidae and wellness , and stay away from ones that contain those ingredients i listed above . 
=================
biscotti more like babies' teething biscuits after reading the other 2 reviews , i bought the pack of 4 cranberry orange no sugar biscotti , but they weren't at all what i was expecting - not crisp and light as most others are , but thick and like the biscuits my children used to teethe on ! ! yes , the taste is good , but certainly one can make a regular biscotti tasty , crispy and still omit the sugar . it takes a looong dunking to get these soft . i'll go with nonni's biscotti any day from now on . 
=================
omg ! ! ! really excited when it got her today , then i opened it up ! all but two were buffalo . one was wild boar and the last one was rotten moldy elk . yum . thank you amazon for refunding my money at least ! ! i selected two day shipping , so it got here fast . please explain how something dehydrated goes putrid in two days ? my guess is they didn't even attempt to look at it before throwing it into a box . 
=================
typical gf taste like too many gf products these are drowning in salt to drown out the bland rice flour flavor . i discovered glutino crackers over the holidays and recommend them as the best gluten free cracker i've tried . my favorite is the glutino cheese cracker with just a hint of cheese flavor that compliments rather than overwhelms the flavor of the spreads , cheese etc . spread on top . a great find for holiday ! 
=================
didn't last long my pup and i really enjoyed this in the beginning . she very quickly learned how to hold the rope with one paw and tip the bottle with the other to get food out . we were starting to learn some other things ( adding balls inside to change how the food fell out , etc ) . screwing the cap on was always difficult , with it needing to be lined up exactly right . soon , however , the threads broke off the bottle so that we could no longer screw the " cap " on . now it is useless . 
=================
hard to get with an entire aisle devoted to crackers my local grocery store only carries a swiss flavored cracker at x - mas . just because chedder is americas favorite doesn't mean its the only flavor . 
=================
the price is the problem the coffee flavor is awesome , one of my all - time favorites - but the price ? almost $ 40 for the 2 - pack , plus shipping ? c'mon gimme a break ! order direct from green mountain coffee roasters ( the people who make it ) for $ 26 for the 2 of them ( $ 13 each ) plus shipping . whoever priced this so high must be smoking something ! 
=================
product is fine , but the price is more than at the grocery store ! i can get this at my local grocery store for $ 2 . 69 per can ( $ 32 . 28 for 12 ) . 
=================
sorry my mistake i recently gave a poor review of this product because my elderly cat appeared to have a reaction of pain while eating it one day and refused to eat it thereafter . i considered that there was a possibility the food may have had a " sliver of bone " or some such contamination and stated this in my review , because my two cats previously liked this food . turns out that she has an allergy to who knows what ( not this product i'm sure ) which has made her mouth sore . the vet said it is common even in young cats and suggested it could have been caused by grass or plants she may have eaten during her short little trips out into the yard . so i am recinding my previous poor review and suggest that you buy this product if your cat likes it . also this is a reminder that all " reviews " , although well intentioned , are not always correct . happy shopping to all ! 
=================
somewhat diappointed i used to get this at the 7 - 11 for five cents each so it brought back memories from my childhood . when i was little , it came in all flavors . this package was the same product and as good as i remembered , but it waslike a multi row of flavors for each bar . when i was little , each bar was a seperate flavor
=================
customize for best taste ! some claimed it was bad b / c of the sucralose taste . i am not a fan of splenda so i almost didn't try . saw it at the store and customized it by hitting the manual button b / f the milk was done and it tasted much better ! ! i figured out it wasn't the splenda so much as it was watered down . try it ! 
=================
corn chex is not gluten - free general mills corn chex ingredients on this site lists " barley malt extract " , which means that this product is not gluten free . be careful . a version of rice chex , however , has just been made available where the barley malt ingredient has been replaced with molasses . thank you general mills ! as always , be sure to read the ingredients on every item you buy , each and every time ! 
=================
spicy , not mild ! if you like mild sprouts , like alfalfa , you might not like this . the radish and broccoli sprouts taste similar to their adult counterparts and pretty much rule the taste of the mix . personally , i like it , but my wife was disgusted . to each their own , i say . . . just be forewarned . also , start small ! these produce a lot of sprouts . i started with about a tablespoon and that was plenty for the grower i used . 
=================
needs proper handling unbrewed leaves had a hay smell , i tried it anyway , brewing like black tea . awful ! then , i researched tea and found different varieties require different methods of brewing . since there are few variables , i decided to expirement before tossing this out . tried sun tea , better , but with an off taste . then , i tried hot [ not boiling ] water for a short time . perfect ! brewed exactly right , this is yummie . 
=================
caution similac alimentum cans are a pain & contain bpa ! i am very disappointed to find out that the ready to feed cans of similac alimentum contain bpa . i couldn't believe it so i had to research it for myself and it's true ! all of similac's other rtf formulas are in plastic bpa free containers . the alimentum also comes in a can that can not be stored for later use . my baby only drinks 4 - 5 ounces at a time , it would be nice if the alimentum rtf were in a plastic container that had a screw top so we could save the remaining several ounces for the next feeding . 
=================
useful ? i bought the smoother because i thought i needed one to make my daughters birthday cake , honestly i think i could have done the same thing with my hand . really if the cake was smooth , you could do it close to smooth . the cost is small enough where if you think you need one get one - but i'm not sure i would repurchase in the future if it broke or i lost it . quality is that it is very thick and seems sturdy . . . just again not sure that i would ever really need one . 
=================
great product but questionable product shipped from amazon i love india tree popcorn and eat is all the time . however , this item arrived without shrink wrap or a factory seal . how do i know it wasn't tampered with ? i tossed it rather than take a chance . 
=================
more cookies than nutrition the name of these " nutri - grain cereal bars " might lead one to believe they have some whole grain nutritional value . but when you read the packaging the only nutrition comes additives . there is no fiber to speak of and they are loaded with high fructose corn syrup . i use them when my blood sugar drops too low much as i would a piece of candy . these travel pretty well and do give you a bit of volume so you don't feel hungry but they are far from being a healthy food choice . 
=================
jet fuel keurig coffe quality of product is excellent , cost is excellent and delivery is superb . very satisfied . 
=================
i wish they were hotter . like many other mass market items with habenero in the name ( looking at you doritos ) these are not as hot as they should be . good for people who feel that taco bell hot sauce is hot , but not for true fans of habenero peppers . 
=================
if you like chewy , gritty , bitter cookies , then these are for you ! i'm not a huge cookie fan . i like my desserts fruity , cheesy or frozen with chocolate fudge on top , the one exception is ginger snaps . i like them even when i'm not in the mood for something cookie'ish , i like them with tea , i like them with coffee , i like them with pepper jack cheese ( everything goes with pepper jack ) . also because they usually aren't terribly sweet and when i go to the trouble of baking them , they seem to last longer than other cookies ( i mean they still taste good the next day , not that i can resist eating them all straight from the baking sheet ) . but these ginger snaps are not right . they are chewy and gritty . stale but burnt in places . i know , it sounds like a manufacturing problem and i thought perhaps the unburnt , not stale ones would be okay if they were rebaked . nope . i picked through the bag to find the snaps that weren't burnt , i put them in the oven to 're - crisp' at a low temp ( 250f ) for about five minutes , in the end they still tasted bitter , gitty , stale and overly sweet . the price is right at around $ 3 a bag , but i think you'd be better off buying an old tried and true brand , such as nabisco ginger snaps ( sweetish , super crispy , reliably cooked for an even crisp texture ) or anna's ginger thins , my new favorite store brand of ginger snaps ( they are wafer thin , spicy and go well with ice cream ) . 
=================
wayyy too * tangy ! * usually i make my own stir fry sauce but one evening for the sake of ease i decided to get this . oh , my . . . god . . . big . mistake . first off , let me say that this sauce isn't necessarily bad tasting . it's just that the flavor is too overpowering , like kikkoman overdid it on the soy and vinegar . as soon as you taste it , you're going to be knocked back by an overwhelming sensation of tanginess and fermented soy . because the sauce was so strong , i double - checked the instructions to make sure if i wasn't supposed to add water or something else extra to dilute it . but nope , you're supposed to pour it straight onto your meal when it's almost finished cooking . i wouldn't say that my meal was completely ruined by this sauce but that it took some effort to get through because of the overpowering " tangy " taste and the unusual flavor . ( although for asian - style meals , it doesn't really taste like any flavor you've ever encountered in asian stir - fry ) . because i don't like to throw out food , i'm going to try to make do with the half a bottle of this sauce i have left by adding a little sugar to neutralize the tanginess . once i do that , that's it - - i'm done with this sauce . i definitely will not be buying it again or recommending it to anyone . if you're tempted to buy it , though , i suggest having additional ingredients handy to dilute its overpowering flavor , especially sugar if you also find it a little too tangy . 
=================
organically incorrect considering the extra that one pays for organic products , this product did not deliver . for one thing it did not pass my smell or taste tests . thyme is a fantastic herb , and i expected the organic to be even more robust than non - organic . i understand that it is dried for packaging , but even so , i did not expect to have to " struggle " so much to extract it's aroma or develop its flavor profile in my dishes . non - chef that i am , i have been around the kitchen long enough to know what i am working with when it comes to my favorite herbs and spices . this brand does not measure up .

only boots and diego cookies a few of the cookies were cracked . also , there are only diego and boots coookies , no baby jaguar cookies .

ok , but a little too soft for our dogs i don't know what it is about the white colored nylabone material ; it is just so much softer than the yellowish material . even though both are labeled " dura chew " the dogs have not yet taken off sizeable pieces of this bone , but they can leave pretty clear tooth markings . this chew needs closer monitoring than the other nylabones we have bought . * * * * * * * * * * * * * update : it is a little more than a year since i first put up this review and i just bought a liver flavored nylabone that is also made from this white colored material . i'm uploading a customer photo to show the difference . if you have a dog that is an agressive chewer , you may want to stay away from the white nylabone material .

overpriced i thought that this was a decent price when i ordered it . two days later i went to a foodstore which had not carried it and found that they had begun stocking the litter for $ 7 . 98 . i like this product ( and so does my fussy cat ) , but feel that i have been ripped off . 
=================
too expensive here i like the product , but it's way too expensive on amazon . keurig's website has a much better deal on these , and they have a club discount . i buy from amazon all the time and would like to see them start a club for k - cups . more and more keurigs are being sold , and the demand is only going to increase . 
=================
no carbs whatsoever i'll never buy those packets again . they contain glucose and maltodextrin . this liquid measures easily and is completely calorie free .

coffee is great delivery horrible between my wife and myself we during at least 6 cappuccino's per day . i have ordered coffee bean direct several times and the product is great . amazon has gone to fedex for shipping and they are the worst . what used to take one day with ups now takes 4 days with fedex . this is the last time i buy this from amazon ! !

i like coffee not by the gallon though ! totally blown away when i received 4 cellophane packages of maxwell house freeze dried coffee . the bags aren't resealable and the directions are for 2 to 4 gallon urns . . . obviously a restaurant supply item . all i can do is shake my head , nothing indicates it as that type of product . the description indicates the coffee is packaged in maxwell house glass jars to preserve the flavor .

sodium benzoate is dangerous - it's in ez - sweetz i was disappointed to find out ez - sweet uses sodium benzoate as one of it's preservatives . this ingredient , when combined with ascorbic acid ( vitamin c ) creates benzene which is carcinogenic ( cancer causing ) . i used to use splenda or generic sucralose packets , but they made a mess on the counter , took up too much room in our pantry when purchased in bulk , and took up alot of space near the coffee maker when compared with concentrated sweeteners . ez sweet would be the easy alternative if it weren't toxic . i had to find a better option . i find that the only super easy way around using ez sweet but also save on space / mess is to use the splenda mini tablets . they are much more expensive than the packets and take time to dissolve , so i've recently found another option . i can purchase 1 oz of pure sucralose powder form from the splendex site and mix it with 3 oz of water ( plus a natural preservative ) to make the equivalent of 2 , 500 packets of splenda . the cost of the 1oz powder is only $ 24 . 95 . i found that other companies sell sucralose powder but haven't found a supplier who sells just 1oz and will supply me with a 4 oz bottle suitable for dispensing the solution . finding the powder wasn't easy . it is not an option on their home / default web page . i had to go to order products and on the right side was an option for the powder . i'm going to experiment with different natural preservatives ( colloidal silver , gse , natural salts , natural acids ) to keep the solution from becoming contaminated with bacteria or fungus . if you're going to go this route , do some research on natural preservatives and if you find one that works well , please leave a comment to this review .

great tasting , but what happened ? ? i used to eat these things by the box ( and my waistline started to show it ! ) , so i stopped buying these for awhile . i have started getting these again as a good " low - cal " snack . they did , however , do something to the recipe . they simply don't taste the same as before . not saying they don't taste good , but just don't taste the same as before . what happened ? i have no idea . maybe it's an attempt to simulate more cheese flavor , but put it back to what it was .

poisoned product two or three months ago , i subscribed to this company for automatic delivery of their dried chicken " breasts " each month . when this month's order arrived , i allowed my golden retriever to eat one only . within a short time he became severely ill and continued vomiting repeatedly throughout the entire night . i am a retired attorney / judge . i do not become hysterical over every complaint that makes a claim that some product or other can kill your pet . now , i greatly regret my cavalier attitude about this particular item . had my golden been weakened in any other way , i do not believe he would have survived this incident . my on - going purchase of this product despite prior bad press and numerous complaints was foolish . but i trusted that the distributors of the dried chicken " breasts " would monitor this product more closely after the first recall of this product so that no other animals would be harmed . such was clearly not the case . in fact , it appears that the only action the u . s . distributors took after the last recall was to print on each package that the product had come from the united states . closer inspection however reveals that although this product was packaged in the u . s . , it continued to be imported from china . amazon is by far the best retailer on the internet by far . my complaint is not against amazon . but i feel compelled to alert other potential customers regarding the poisoning my dog suffered ( and he did suffer ) . i can imagine other pets who are smaller , older , or in some other way more vulnerable than my golden , would and could actually die if they consumed even the smallest amount of this product . it's true that this was not the case every month . rather it is an intermittent but on - going problem . i cannot emphasize enough how serious this problem is . it is absolutely necessary to eliminate the distribution of this product in the u . s . once and for all . please amazon , end your involvement in this matter .

the bars are fine . this deal is not . i have severe diet restrictions . all you who would like to be thin , i can recommend the ibs diet - - as little fat as possible ( i find i can take no more than 5 grams of fat in a meal ) , no dairy , no nuts , no chocolate , no caffeine , no decaf , limit wheat flour , no red meat , no heavy meals , no empty stomach , and on and on . deviate from the diet restrictions and you will lose weight . eat carefully and you still lose weight . this allows very few options when you eat out or you're on the road . since i work a job which requires a fair amount of travel in a large rural area , finding a 'nutrition bar' or snack food i can eat was a challenge . cliff bars are easy to find in most walmarts , and cost just under a dollar each . they're a little cheaper in case lots - - $ 5 for a box of 6 . i can only eat 2 kinds , and of course they're popular , so i seldom find them in boxes . i searched online and was surprised to see walmart . com offers an assortment of 3 boxes ( 18 bars ) for $ 15 . they add $ 1 . 47 for shipping , but even so , that's a much better price than amazon's offering here . if you like these , or have a lot of kids and family who do , you may want to check out that source .

product - - outstanding ; price - - gouging ! ! we researched cat foods to find the best , and newman's is one of the best . the problem is that i can buy it for ~ $ 9 . 60 for the 3lb bag and ~ $ 13 . 70 for the 4 . 75 . it was not easily found at local stores , but definitely worth the effort . i hope amazon gets a little more realistic in regard to pricing this line

does not work for deer , at least in texas this product did not work at all for me for deer in texas , ( where the deer population is 6 million or so ) . most of the rave reviews are concerning squirrels or rabbits , but my problem was deer . the squirrels and rabbits don't eat that much and i always plant a little extra anyway . the product is called " deer off " , and has a picture of a deer running on it . toward my pea patch , i suppose . i noticed the deer had visited my 60 foot row of purple hull and zipper peas ( about 18 " high and blooming ) , the previous night , and had nibbled a little on one end . i went back to the house and got the miracle bottle that my wife had bought a few months earlier just for this occasion . i sprayed about half a bottle of deer off ( ready to use ) till everything was wet , and the next morning it looked like you ran over it with a lawn mower , and deer tracks were everywhere . the deer absolutely ate the stems and all right to the ground . they ought to sell this stuff to hunters for a lure . so it's off to the grocery store to buy peas . no satisfaction from woodstream customer service either . they have a 30 day limit on refunds . live and learn . terry

leaks i have breastfeed two children and have tried every breast milk storage bag on the market and after trying them all i landed on lansinoh storage bags and used them for 2 years with my first child . after i had my second child i decided to look into the market again to see if there was a better bag for reasons : better for enviroment , cost effective and no leaks . well i tried the honey suckle brand because they were everything i was looking for with very good reviews so i bought 300 bags . well im terribly disapppointed , they leak ! i have had them leak by just setting them on the table the bottom seal pops open , during thawing process , and ive had a few that were thawed and placed in fridge and all of the sudden started leaking for no reason . evertime it is the bottom seal . i tried to contact the company by email several times to let them know of the problem im having so they can hopefully prevent this problem for furture customers but no response . . in the 300 bags i purchased probably 100 leaked , some i could save some milk while others lost all which is very furstrating

good coffee , bad espresso ! these beans are not meant for your espresso machine ! caffe appassionato beans are roasted very dark and are oily just like a french roast . i would not be surprised one bit if this is french roast . i think many americans like dark roasted coffee because they are used to drinking crappy burnt drip coffee that sits on the burners too long . this coffee has absolutely no character what so ever . my opinion is that its way too dark and taste burnt . the espresso shots brewed very unevenly . i pulled a double shot in separate cups on my expobar espresso maker and ended up with one cup having a significant more espresso than the other . the beans were ground very evenly in my gaggia burr grinder at setting 4 just like any other bean i've used for espresso . there was barely any crema ! i will try a coarser ground the next time around just to see if i can pull a more even shot . i prepare several shots per day on my expobar espresso machine , have experimented with numerous varieties of beans over the past 3 years of owning this machine and have always made excellent espresso drinks . unfortunately , this was not the case with caffe appassionato . caffe appassianato espresso roast makes a good cup of coffee in the french press but these beans are the worst for espressso . 4 stars as coffee , 1 star as espresso . if you want to buy espresso beans here on amazon , go with lavazza . they have a $ 17 bag that is very good . i just ordered another bag of lavazza after tasting my first shot of caffe appassionato . don't let all of the 5 star reviews fool you , this is not espresso !

nasty chemical aftertaste i wasn't expecting much from a calorie - free " chocolate " dip . i figured it would taste mostly like artificial sweetener , and so i didn't plan to eat it straight . i sliced up a banana , put a tablespoonful or so of the dip on it , and then topped with with some fat - free whipped topping - - so there were two things i * really * like in the bowl with the dip . i still couldn't finish it . i'm a diabetic , so i have to watch the amount of sweets i eat ; i have a real sweet tooth , so i'm * used * to the flavour of artificial sweeteners and " fake " foods . ( people , i think fat free cool whip is * good stuff * . we're talking " not a gourmet , " here . definitely not a food snob . but i thought that this was nasty . why two stars ? because my housemate * loved * it . he's happily spooning it onto oatmeal , fruit , graham crackers . . . he may be putting it on his hamburgers , for all i know . : ) and if someone else thought it was * that * good , i can't give it one star , even if i personally loathe it .

this milk makes our baby really sick ! ! : ( sorry to give this 1 star . but this milk really makes our baby really sick ! ! : ( , literally ! ! if your baby can take it , i guess it's a good one but for us , we had the worst experience with it . here is our story . my baby had been solely breastfed . after 9 months my wife was running short of her milk . she didn't have enough breastmilk for the baby and he didn't take as much solid food as we would want him to . we gave him similac advance , it was recommended by the hospital . first similac advance liquid , he threw up 9 times within 2 hours after half an hour of feeding . that happened twice . a few days later , we tried similac advance power , he threw up again ! this time 5 times plus serious diarrhea for 5 days . he has lost 5 % of his weight within 2 days . that's really bad . we were desperate . we took him to the hospital twice that week . the doctor though it was stomach flu . however , i didn't quit agree with him . what a coincident that 2 different formula milk feeding incidents would throw my baby off balance . i'm a computer engineer and dealing with solving and debugging problems all the time . i was firm with the doctor that this was not a coincident . i thought it might have something to do with the protein in the formula that my baby couldn't digest . we decided to try lactose free formula ( nutramigen from enflora ) . it smell and taste really awful ( my wife tried it and she gagged . as we thought , my baby rejected to drink it . then i tried good start soy . same story , smell bad but not as bad as nutromigen . my baby also rejected to drink it . now we were really desperate , not enough milk for him and he doesn't like to eat solid food ! ! he would throw up + diarrhea if he gave him normal formula milk . phone call to 4 advise nurses , no luck ! i finally search on the internet and found a lot of similar story to what we experienced ( including this on amazon reviews ) . i decided to give it a final try , crossing our fingers really tight . good start gentle plus is our last hope or my baby would not have any more milk to drink . he's losing weight ! ! and then miracle happened ! ! ! this milk works wonderfully for him . the only complain i would have is that it doesn't smell as good as the normal cow milk - based formula , however , doesn't smell or taste awful like the other two . my baby didn't quite used to the tasted in the beginning and didn't really want to drink it at first . so we tried mixed it with breastmilk for a few days . now he is a happy baby , gaining weight , doesn't throw up and used to the taste of it . my wife and i are now happy again : )

12 - gram monster pod not significantly better i usually buy the 10 - gram , see my review of the coffee quality there . baronet coffee nutty irishman medium roast , 18 - count coffee pods ( pack of 3 ) this time i tried the 12 - gram 16 per box . same excellent coffee . brewed the same way with a cuisinart cup - o - matic , the larger size made very little difference . additionally , so far 2 of the pods were split a little , spilling some of the coffee out . i can't be sure it didn't happen from tearing open the packet ; perhaps you need to be more careful opening the larger pod packets . bottom line for me : the difference between the 12 - gram and the 10 - gram wasn't significant . and the baronet pods that are loose in bags contain only 7 . 77 grams per pod . so i will stick with the 10 - gram 18 - count .

got old fast . i'm a big fan / drinker of green tea and a big fan / drinker of earl grey , but this tea is a little too bergamot - y for my taste . it may be because plain green tea naturally has a weaker taste than black tea , and the bergamot is therefore more evident . after a couple cups of this i decided these two tastes are best on their own .

misleading marketing of a modestly above - mediocre product why can't they promote this product honestly ? it's not a * bad * product . i didn't find it actually objectionable . it's mildly sweet , and has a sort of nondescript , chocolate - simulating flavor . on its own merits , if i were in a really great mood i might even give it four stars in spite of its relative synthetic blandness and the lack of peanut butter or any resemblance to its flavor . they've actually accomplished something fairly worthwhile in creating a frozen dessert with so few calories , and i'd give it some appreciation on that basis . but . . . " ice cream replacement " ? " smooth and creamy " ? it is neither of these , by any estimation . it's an " ice cream replacement " only in the sense that yogurt or pudding or a ham sandwich are - - as things one might eat instead of ice cream . it's objectively not " smooth " , and anyone expecting it to be ( for example , because they read the label ) is going to be highly upset to find that it is instead gritty and grainy , so much so that it actually makes sound when you pass a spoon through it , similar to scooping packed wet sand . it has a mouthfeel more like a poorly - made sherbet ; the ice crystals are large enough that you can almost see them . this doesn't mean it can't be " good " - - snow cones are super gritty with huge ice crystals and they're still well - liked . overall , it was okay . i definitely like that i can eat small amounts of this stuff even on a keto diet . i think they've got a good product idea , and it deserves a slot on the shelf next to the other frozen desserts . but , a note to the arctic zero folks - - celebrate your product and promote it for what it is . why spoil your efforts by lying about what you've made ?

broke in less than an hour . i bought this product to occupy my 13 - month - old mix . she is an aggressive chewer , but the product description led me to believe that this toy was quite tough . when i received it , i was a little disheartened when i saw that the tug was rubber , rather than rope ( as it appears in the picture ) - as she tends to get through rubber toys with very little effort . nevertheless , i decided to try it out , she learned quickly that she could get treats out of it and it occupied her very well for almost an hour . at that point i went to dig it out from under the bed and was dismayed to find that the rubber " pull " was already in pieces . while the bottle still works and seems to keep her interested , i feel like dog toys should have a more indestructible nature than this one does . especially for eleven dollars !

tastes good , but at what cost ? stevia in the raw contains saccharine , which is most commonly found in sweet n' low , which has been linked to bladder cancer . . . " the actual warning reads : " use of this product may be hazardous to your health . this product contains saccharin , which has been determined to cause cancer in laboratory animals . " note that this warning was removed in 2000 by the us congress ( not by the fda ) after heavy lobbying by the saccharin industry . further research was then done on saccharin , because the fda wished to ban saccharin outright but the food companies fought this ( successfully ) . the national cancer institute ran studies in the next 2 years and found that saccharin was indeed connected with bladder cancer . people who drank only 2 cans or more a day of diet soda had an increased risk . " stevia by itself is one of the 'healthiest' low cal sweeteners on the market but when mixed with things like saccharine - i mean you might as well just use sweet n' low . the only pure stevia brand i have found is sweetleaf stevia - it is not as delicious and most certainly has a bit of an aftertaste , but i have gotten used to it since i have a blood sugar problem and can't consume sugar . my advice is that unless you physically cannot handle sugar , a small amount of raw sugar is much better for you than all this artificial crap . just be smart about the stevia bandwagon everyone is jumping on , because pretty much every brand out there is just some other sweetener mixed with stevia and then sold as 'healthy' .

five star dropping to one star my wife and i discovered planters spanish redskin peanuts a number of years ago and since that time there was always a place on our kitchen counter where everyone could share this wonderful treat . recently the 56 - oz can we purchased contained only very light colored peanuts . these were not as well cooked , appeared to have less oil used in the roasting process and therefore the salt normally found evenly distributed mostly migrated to the bottom of the can . worse , a few peanuts were so brittle i first thought they were foreign objects . in an effort to find the good formula we purchased three of the 12 . 5 - ounce size and two of the 56 - ounce size . unfortunately all were the disappointing new version that we dislike . i just concluded a phone call with kraft foods ( 10 - 8 - 12 ) , the parent company of planters . while they did not admit to the product being changed i was told spanish redskin peanuts were discontinued and would soon be out of stock everywhere . kraft offered coupons as a good will gesture for all the planters spanish peanuts we're throwing away , but since the old perfect treat is no more , it's a disappointing resolution . seldom does a commercially manufactured product like this win over both my wife and i . i must say i'm really sad to see it go , especially since the newest , poorly roasted version is not worth stocking up on .

what the heck did they do to the wrappers ? ! ? ! my family has enjoyed these cookies for more than a decade , and at our christmas eve dinner , we brought them out at the usual time , and started with the annual tradition of " flying angels . " for those of you not familiar with these cookies , if you wrap them in a cylinder , and light the top , when the fire reaches the base , the wrapper shoots up in the air . it's actually quite a bit of fun . so imagine our surprise this year when none of the wrappers would fly . we compared old wrappers and new , and something has changed about the wrappers . whether it's wax , weight , or something else , none would fly for us ( and we have an awful lot of people who are experienced with this ) . so , if you're a fan of these cookies , and the fun tradition that's sprung up around them , i caution you , you may not be able to enjoy them this year as you have done in the past .

be careful ! ! ( if amazon later decides to carry this product ) first of all , i decided to stay away from the chicken flavor since i found out just b / c dog treats & food say made in the usa , doesnt mean the chicken farm the company uses is also in the usa . i bought the " real beef & barley flavor " & it's not hard like in bone - hard . it begins to crumbles apart as the dogs chew it which was fine w / me . i gave it 2 stars because it seems to have really healthy ingredients but still havent figured out why it made my dog so sick . the problem was , my 5 yr old dog ( min pin ) carried it around yet refused to eat the bone after sniffing it a few times . i figure he was just being picky because his 2yr old 23 lb son , gordo , ate it ( but got sick later ) . after eating 1 beef bone he wouldnt eat his doggie food the rest of the day & night . less then 4 , 5 hrs , i seen gordo at his water bowl then instantly threw the water up . there was very little traces of the beef bone tho . . until after 1 am . he kept waking me up by scratching my hands to rub his tummy . the minute he broke to go to their doggie pee & poop pads , i rolled over & quickly went back to sleep ! in the morn , my son went to get a pair of clean socks out of the dryer & seen diarreha & pudding poop all over both pads & floor . i realized definitly it came from gordo after checking both dog's butt butts . i cant seem to find any reviews on it but haven't looked at all the consumer sites yet . just wanted to warn other pet owners to be careful . thank god i didnt give gordo 2 bone treats * whew *

it would have been 5 stars but a whole section of the coconut oil was missing from the jar i never write reviews , because i have not had any complaints on any of my products that i have purchased through amazon . i understand that its not just about bad reviews but good ones too , but for me the product is always great unless i am writing a review . thus here i am writing a review today . i must state that if the coconut oil had not been missing an entire section of coconut oil from the right side of the jar , i would be giving this product 5 stars . i love the taste , quality , shipping time etc . , but the missing oil in the right side of the jar ( the oil is solid ) shocked the heck out of me . i would have written something earlier about this , but i just haven't had the time . every time i look in the jar though , it still shocks me . i wondered if it was due to the way the product was packaged . maybe it rolled onto its side and caused the top to be more full and the right side to be empty , however , it wasn't full to the top . also it's solid and i didn't order it during the warm months for it to be liquid and change . so , yes , i feel ripped off . however , i'm using the coconut oil because i do need it and already have it in my possession . i will not be buying my now bi - monthly supply again through this dealer though , unless they decide to make this right .

haribo versions german haribos don't contain artificial flavors and no artificial colors . german haribos are all natural . the turkish ones however taste too sweet and less fruity , and look much more colorful because of artificial colors ( fd & c yellow no . 5 , red no . 40 , blue no . 1 ) and unnatural flavors . when you send a mail to haribo , they reply that the turkish haribos , sold in the us , contain that artificial stuff , so that the gummy bear flavor survives the long shipping by ship . looking at long shelf life duration of even the german haribos that seems like a lie to me . cost cutting and less restrictive us - food regulation seem to be the real reasons . . . hungarian made haribos ( seen in india ) aren't any better btw .

price is decent , product is not ! i used to buy these bold espresso dark roast pods from starbucks ; enjoying both the flavor and buzz . these pods are very mild , nothing bold to be found with them , i'm on my 3rd pod today awaiting the buzz . these are not expired until 11aug12 so i suspect although the box indicates bold these are mislabeled and really are mild . i called both amazon and starbucks to share my comments about this purchase . both are pleasant but have nor rhyme or reason for these pods " missing the mark " . this definitely is not recommended !

cinnamon water . my mom gave me a box of this a few years ago and i had just recently gotten around to trying it . it was excellent . i bought another box and the second i opened the first packet i could smell that they had changed the recipe . checking the back of the two boxes confirmed it . cinnamon is about all i taste when i drink it , although the aftertaste has a hint of clove . pretty expensive for something that tastes mixed by a child .

not a variety we ordered this for the variety , and made a separate order of just plain chocolate flavored straws . the description of this product doesn't tell enough . what you get is ten packages , each containing five straws at 0 . 21 ounces each . so the value is good , but there is no variety , they are all chocolate . so we are all stocked up on chocolate now ! the product is great , but the two stars are for the misleading description .

my bichon loves halo food , but not this one . . . i was surprised to see the package is small . but since my dog eats the salmon and chicken dry dog food from the halo brand for years , and he loves it , so i was going to give a try for the dog treats . for some reason , he didn't want to eat it at all - probably it doesn't have a strong dog food / chicken smell ? but i'm sure they made it with good ingredients - i can see the oats in the biscuits . i wish they could improve the flavor a bit to attract the dogs more - since i have seen other reviewer having similar comments .

only 12 bags i use biobag dog bags and love them , so i tried the kitchen bags also . the dog bags are sturdy and don't tear at all , but the kitchen bags seem to be made from something else . they don't fit in an average kitchen garbage bin and they also tear extremely easily . if you are using them strictly as compost bags and only putting scraps in them i'm sure they'd do fine , but they shouldn't be used for an average kitchen garbage bag . also , it only contains 12 bags . add the price of shipping and this becomes very expensive for a bag only to be used in a compost pile . 
=================
not good . if you even like this product . . . the bottle design doesn't allow one to effectively shake up the ingredients before pouring therefore you get all oil right off the top . i suggest pouring it into a bowl and whisking . it contains xanthan gum but it wasn't effective as an emulsifier . no one flavor stood out but i could taste the canola oil . i like tart and this isn't . with the sweetness of the fig , a bit more acidity would have balanced it out . i found the flavor cloying and unpalatable . i even tried adding wine vinegar to it but it didn't help . it ended up sitting in my refrigerator for over 6 months . i finally used some to baste the top of a pork roast and poured the rest down the drain . i still can't figure out why they added caramel color when balsamic vinegar is already dark and so is fig paste . also , i bought this on sale ( it was a discontinued item ) at my store . i asked one of the managers why it was was discontinued and he said usually it's because the product was not a good seller . i can see why .

just add a tiny bit . . . wow , this stuff is sweet ! i would only add a tiny bit . it has a distinctive fruit punch ( think kids artificial not actual fruit ) flavor and we didn't notice any extra energy from it . i did let the kids try a sip & my 5 year old thought it was " good & sweet ( this was with very little added ) " but didn't want any more . it has to be refrigerated once opened and is much larger than it's competitor mio ( about 4 times larger ) . that said , i'm not a huge fruit punch fan so if you are this may be what you are looking for .

jamon iberico - highly overrated after much anticipation i ordered the three main jamon ham products : iberico de bellota , iberico de bellota paleta , & jamon serrano . being used to proscuitto ( parma ) and loving it by itself and in many dishes , i had high expectations . if you haven't had good proscuitto , then there isn't really anything to compare the jamon product to . the chopped stuff at your everyday grocery store is good for a little salty proscuitto like flavor in dishes but not for slices just to enjoy . i understand why people think jamon is awesome , but the melting in your mouth with extreme grease / fat over your lips and fingers really sets home the fat content more than that kobe beef flavor burst and easier swallow . in the high end jamon , you can really taste the acorns in the meat . the nuttiness really comes through and it is very good . the iberico paleta - > you don't get the nuttiness and it's a little tougher . the serrano really has much more meat and i preferred the flavor profile on it more than the other two . while i would rate the iberico bellato around 4 out of 5 stars ( minus 1 for the heavy greasy feeling and fat ) , the price is ridiculous . i would say it would be appropriately priced around $ 15 - 25 / pound . given that is 4 - 6x lower than it's actual price , i had to take at least 2 stars from the product . you're better off with the sm proscuitto . it's delicious and you get 4x the amount without the heavy grease .

concerned about mercury content tuna , as is well documented , absorb and store mercury in fat . anything that eats that fat consumes mercury . i wouldn't feed tuna to a child , and i'd recommend any adult to read the literature regarding mercury content in seafood . how can it be safely fed to a cat ? regarding this brand of cat food , it's excellent as long as you feed chicken or turkey .

not recommended - - stale . i thought i'd try this product , as my mom loves crackers and things like the wasa crispbreads . these were disappointing to both my mom and myself . they tasted stale , even though the expiration date was almost a year away . the flavor was somewhat improved by toasting them . they are edible enough , and i won't return them to amazon because i wouldn't want to cause them unnecessary expense , but i won't order them again . note , the packaging is different from the photograph . since i'm stuck with 11 boxes , i plan to take them to class , where hungry classmates will gradually eat them up . just fyi , they are not vegan , for people that need that . i've copied the ingredients list as printed on the box . " ingredients : spelt wheat flour , water , malt , expeller pressed soy bean oil , salt , egg whites , yeast . toppings : sesame seeds , poppy seeds , garlic , caraway seeds , dehydrated onion flakes . " " manufactured for : good groceries company , brooklyn ny , 11231 " they were mailed to amazon in hazleton , pa from " adam gershuny , good groceries company , 44 heller park lane , somerset nj , 08873 - 1206 " i appreciate amazon giving us the opportunity to try different products , but will try to do better next time in choosing which snacks to order .

dont listen to the dont eat agave ppl ! i'm so sick of ppl trying to mislead . i've lost 40lbs over the last year with a few diet changes , no working out , and agave has been one of my changes . people say it is actually bad for you and has a high gi value , always question them ! i went onto the gi site , and this has a value of 10 - 19 ( per 10grams ) , which is low , highs being 70 + . also , not all agave is created equal , meaning , if processed it can ruin the quality and content . so , be careful on who you purchase this from . less processing , the better . 10 grams of sugar has a gi of about 56 . 66610 grams of agave has a gi of about 10 - 19

has this product changed recently ? question answered - yes and no ! a week ago , i would have given this product 5 stars with no hesitation . i've been giving these treats to my cat ( and my dog who insists on being included ) for a number of years . both pets have loved them and have always begged for more , with no problems . this week , i bought a new supply at trader joe's and anticipated the customary excited response . instead , the cat sniffed at several , but refused to eat them . the dog , a canine garbage disposal who will eat anything except the very expensive dog food her delicate digestive system functions well on , also refused them . i tried again later that day when both animals were hungrier . the cat literally spit them out , one after another . the dog , ever on the alert for a dropped crumb , also turned her little nose up at them . the ingredient list looks the same , although i thought the treats themselves looked a bit darker . i don't have an old bottle to compare to , but i think the design of the label is a bit different . has anyone else had the same recent experience ? i'm really disappointed because this seemed like such a good product and one my pets liked . i hope my feral cat visitors will benefit from the rejects . any suggestions for a substitute would be very welcome . thanks ! june 20 , 2010 follow - up review . i spoke with the company and was told that mine was the first ( only ? ) question they had had regarding the possibility of an off - tasting batch . i decided to give the treats another try and checked the use - by date to be sure the next ones were from a different batch . they were . they were greeted with the same excitement as with the earlier ones . i've since purchased several more and all have been fine . must have been a rotten fish in there somewhere !

you're paying for the tin for father's day i presented dear old dad with all moustache - themed gifts ; these candies made the cut . the candy itself is quite off putting . . . as while itty bitty 'staches are adorable , the fact that they're a smokey black / gray color makes the brain think of licorice or , well , anything that isn't fruity . but they're indeed generically fruit - flavored . not too tasty and pretty darn hard . not sure we recieved the freshest batch , but i think had they been more gummy or even passably soft they'd have scored higher on the taste scale . but the fact is you buy this sort of novelty as a stocking stuffer type of gift , or , in my case , just to go with a theme . the tin is well made and dad will probably use it to store some tiny , albeit manly man odds & ends . is it overpriced for what you actually get ? you betcha ! but since they don't sell moustache candy at every corner store , the price is worth the smile . just skip actually eating the candy . . . unless chipping a tooth is kind of your thing or if you're on the 'dark grey food only' diet . and of course , understand it's a small piece and won't feed ( if you're brave ) the entire neighborhood . small 'stache for lots of cash . 4 stars for the novelty tin , 1 star for the contents . if you're dead set on mustache candy and have teeth as mighty as chuck norris , order away !

mediocre flavor & brew , not starbucks quality ! in 2011 , when starbucks broke away from tassimo bosch over a contractual dispute , i was completely disappointed , and wonderedwhat other options were going to be available , in the meantime , i purchased a warehouse supply of starbuck's coffee & cappuccino andstarted researching a new coffee machine , and then . . . in november , i found out that starbucks was offering the " k - cup " version , for the keurig coffee machines . i ordered and received a brand new b145 officepro model , a supposedly 'heavy - duty' keurig model . . . in january , i started to put the keurig thru it's paces , along side the tassimo , and frankly the tassimo is still superior , in the way that it brews for better flavor , has a faster brewing cycle , and heats the h2o to the optimal temperature , than the keurig , which btw , is / was a lot nosier than the tassimo . in all fairness , this could be a 'technical' problem with the bar code settings on the k - cups . note , that i continued to also use my red tassimo unit , as it is / was the only coffee unit to use the milk creamers , as keurig still does not offer that option , anywhere ! in february , i left on a 3 - week trip , and as i always do , i turned off all the unnecessary electric household appliances . when i returned back in this month of march , i was so pissed to find out that the brand new keurig was totally inoperable ! nada ! zip ! zero ! despite , doing everything that was recommended on forums ( don't go the keurig forums , as they are so worthless ! ) now , i have a large , fancy keurig brick that i am attempting to get a refund for , so stay tuned ! * pike place + colombian + folgers are the different varieties that i tried on the new keurig machine . the colombian was the best of the lot . read my comments , after each bullet item : * features fresh starbucks coffee in an easy - to - brew single - cup ( k - cup ) serving . - not as good as the tassimo , which is about 2 steps below a starbucks coffee house . i often found the keurig " brew " to be a tad watery , not rich & flavorful . * brews in 1 minute or less , so you can grab a cup when you're in a rush . - but , you have to turn the unit on first , so that it will warm up first , before the blue light comes on , indicating that it is ready to start brewing . * medium roast ground coffee - they call it 'medium' , but i think it's more mild ! * smooth & balanced - disagree , balanced with what ? tea ? * rumor of a sale price of only 38 buckaroos at sam's club & costco - i cannot confirm this rumor . * there is now a new rumor that starbucks is going to be offering their consumer coffee machine in the fall ! stay tuned !

not bottled water amazon has a problem . a person can send them info on why they should change product info , but they have idiots working for them who don't understand that they don't need an act of god to change obviously erroneous info . 90 % of the time , they refuse to correct obvious mistakes . what a bunch of jerks . and yes , this is the helstar cd - burning star . . . not bottled water as the heading and item description indicate .

not great , but not bad . this doesn't taste like tang to me like the other reviewer says . tastes like lemonade with a hint of cranberry . not bad for sugar free and pretty easy to make . at this time the price is half of what the other ocean spray flavors are , not sure why , but a great value . i paid $ 11 . 24 . today's price ( 10 / 22 / 11 ) $ 10 . 24 .

dog loved it but left a mess my doberman went nuts over this bone . he tried to devour it rather quickly . my only complaint about this bone is that it left a mess on the floor ; the red color of the bone rubs onto the floor . it did wipe up fairly easily . just make sure when you give the bone to your dog he's not eating it on a carpeted floor .

good kit but follow these recommendations i make wine on the side , and at first it took a lot of research and time . if your new at wine making , get this kit but be warned you will need more than just this kit . besides the kit , you will need a glass carboy , plastic fermentor ( plastic bucket ) , glass bottles 25 - 30 , corker ( to insert corks ) and gas release knob ( to vent gas , without getting the fermentor dirty ) . everything else is optional , such as pump ( recommended ) , funnels , thermometer , filters , heat gun ( for shrinking covers ) , etc . also , for a better taste create 5 gallons of the kit instead of 6 ( simply stop adding water at the 5 gallon mark ) . a common word used in the instructions is " must . " its simply the mixture of water , grapes , and yeast . in sum , it will cost roughly $ 80 - 120 for all the equipment ( that can be reused over and over ) and $ 40 for this kit . doing the math , it will cost $ 1 . 50 to $ 3 . 00 a bottle , not bad for table wine .

unsavory selection based on an amazon customer's valid comment today , i'm amending this review to encourage readers to consider that it has been a long time since i wrote the review and that it could have merely been a bad batch for that month . i'll place an order with every confidence that the tomatoes will be of high quality . indeed , it was never my intention to be unfair to the manufacturer . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ briefly put , the tomatoes that should have a sweet , mellow taste instead have a " tin - can " taste . was mine an isolated case ? the company alone will have to answer that question . i'm only advising potential buyers to exercise caution . the product is produced in italy , by the way , with home - grown tomatoes , so they should have tasted wonderful .

it's got a ginger twist i love having ginger ale to drink especially when my stomach isn't feeling well so i tried to purchase this and see how i would like it . it was nothing like i imagined it to taste like . it has a real taste to the actual ginger root and i was highly disappointed because it was nothing like what i expected especially with all the positive reviews . so buyer beware that this product has that ginger root taste to it . and now i am stuck with the bulk that i purchased , so i'll look into giving it away to friends who may enjoy it . i got this sadly comment back from some bored person : nowhereman says : six of your eight reviews are one star . perhaps it is merely poor judgment in purchasing decision making . maybe you need to see someone for postpartum depression . any attempt at defensive rebuttal might help provide insight into the psychological origins of this hostility and help a professional to diagnose if you need education or treatment . run , don't walk to caregivers . they can help you sort it out as i am uniquely unqualified to pinpoint the exact nature of the problem . it would not hurt to take english as a second language in either case . my take on your reply to my review : too bad , if you don't like what you read you are free to move on . i don't post reviews for entertainment purposes as you seem to be evaluating and insulting comments posted . before you judge someone from a petty post of review please keep in mind it does not give you the person's lifestyle nor psychological origins . i work in the medical field so if anyone needs help that is for you to seek , i also have two special needs children so please education does run deep in this household . keep your comments to yourself . sadly after what you have posted it's obvious you are in need of some jesus and the love you lack in life . god bless !

best way to kill moles . like all traps , it must be set correctly . these traps have a much better kill ratio than the other traps . i have one of these , a harpoon trap , and some that you bury in the tunnels . poisons , grub killers , and gasses probably don't work , and you will never have a body to know for sure . trapping is the best method . i've also flooded the tunnels then shot the mole . flooding the tunnels did more damage than the mole did . i've also nailed a couple with a harpoon trap too , but the scissor type is more effective and i rarely have a sprung trap with no mole . the out o sight scissor trap is the best one . people who are giving this bad reviews must not be setting it correctly , i had the same problems until i learned to set them right . do a google or youtube search and learn how to set them right and you will catch them . 1 . keep your grass short to help spot the tunnels . 2 . pick a tunnel and set the trap correctly on that tunnel , stomp all of the other tunnels down flat , not the one your trapping on . 3 . if you haven't caught the mole in 48 hours , the tunnel is abandoned and needs to be relocated . stomp the tunnel down flat and move the trap to a different newer tunnel . i usually catch them overnight

didn't like the taste and texture i bought these on the strength of the reviews . inside the thin wrapper the texture was mushy , and i didn't like the taste at all . it tastes mostly of beef heart , smoke and spices . i found them inedible . i had several of my friends try them since i didn't want to waste them if someone else could eat them . the first two friends did not like them , but the third did , so they found a home . the free sample of barbeque beef jerky was delicious , and i am going to order some of that . addendum : not long after i wrote the above review , i recieved a telephone call from the company . he said that they stand behind all of their products , and even though i could not return the item since i had given them away , he would send me a replacement of any other jerky . he sent me the barbeque jerky which i had sampled before . with two additional free samples of other flavors , which were also quite good . i have never dealt with such a wonderful concern for their customers as i experienced with this company . i think you can't go wrong buying from them . he said if anyone doesnt like what they get , they will replace it .

only catnip my cat will respond to i've bought catnip a couple times before ( even grew some ) for my crazy cocobean but he's ignored it all . thought it was him ( he doesn't like fish flavor either ) . then i saw reviews for this stuff and thought i'd try . . . rather , i'd let him try . well , he loves it . plays like the stoned out cat i was hoping for . wonder what makes this stuff so special ? thought catnip was catnip . guess i was wrong .

believe the reviewers who complain about imminent expiration dates ! i should've paid attention to the reviewers who warned that their coffee arrived shortly before the marked expiration dates on the bags . mine did as well . no way i'll go through the three bags in time . for that reason , and the fact that this coffee tastes no better than what you'd get at your corner gas station , i'm cancelling my subscribe and save order . one other thing i should've checked out : the majority of the five star reviews are the only product the reviewers ever reviewed . must be a community coffee employee incentive plan .

no itching when i use some other deodorants , especially those super scented ones , my arm pits tend to get itchy and irritated . i tried this deodorant specifically because of the non - irritating aloe claim . their claim is accurate , i love this deodorant because it keeps me dry with no irritation . it also smells pretty good , if i want to load up on scents i'll just add some cologne .

too many calories per serving for a cereal that seems to be trading on the suggestion that it is a healthy choice , this product fails . calories and fat are too high for a 3 / 4 cup serving of cereal , and that is because the fat and sugar content are too high . get fiber plus cereal , cinnamon oats crunch , 11 . 5 - ounce boxes ( pack of 3 ) instead . the taste is outstanding and the nutritional components are much better . the calories are less than half of this cereal , fiber is as good , sugar is much lower , and fat is very low . the fiber plus cereal has been an important part of my success in losing 40 pounds in the last 6 months . my wife also changed to fiber plus for breakfast most mornings , and has lost 33 pounds in the same period of time . ( no , the cereal is not responsible for all of our weight loss , but it gets credit for helping us control our calories at breakfast while still getting good nutritional value ) . i can have a bowl of the fiber plus , half a banana , and milk for 40 less calories a bowl than this uncle sam cereal is dry out of the box . 
=================
not my favorite the mariani mixed fruit was not my favorite . we could challenge each other's palate here , but there was a faux - taste that could not be described with words . something was missing ( not sugar ) ? ? ? 
=================
tastes good but not enough aroma i like everything except for weak aroma . i don't know why . it just doesn't have nearly as much nice coffee smell as the other ones . aroma is one of the things i enjoy when i make expresso . this is why i gave 4 star .

i expected a lot more from the newman's own brand . i have tried a couple of products from the newman's own line and , while i didn't necessarily think they were better than their competitors' products of the same type , they definitely held their own . i sadly did not find this to be true with the newman's own organics dark chocolate bar . when it comes to reviewing edible products , i find it helpful to compare and contrast with a similar product from another brand . because i love dove dark chocolate ( though i try many different kinds of dark chocolate ) , i used the dove silky smooth dark chocolate bar as comparison ( though i prefer the dove promise individual bites , it was easier to compare bar to bar ) . the dove dark bar is 33 grams and the serving size is the entire bar . the newman's own organics dark chocolate bar is 64 grams , nearly double the size of the dove bar , and still 1 serving is considered the entire bar . now , i am as much of a chocolate lover as the next person ( probably more , in fact ) , but there is no way i need nor want to eat to consume 64g of chocolate in one sitting ( especially sub - par chocolate ) . in most nutritional areas , especially fat and sat fat , the 33g dove bar and the 64g newman bar are almost equal if you consider that one is double the size of the other . newman's only clear win over the dove bar is on cholesterol , having 0mg even though it is double the size of the dove ( which has 5mg cholesterol ) . for those watching sugar , the smaller dove bar has 17g while big daddy newman has 37g . with the health business out of the way , let's get down to brass tacks - - taste and texture : texture . i am accustomed to the smooth , creamy texture of dove dark chocolate - - i find its mouth feel luxurious . my initial thought on biting into and chewing the newman was waxiness - - quite nasty at first but , once i got it chewed , it had a nicer mouth feel . it is not creamy like dove , but it loses the waxiness once chewed . taste . the only thing particularly pleasant to me about the newman bar was the finish . . . the very last taste as you're swallowing it . that has a deep rich dark chocolate taste and , despite the 37g of sugar in it , is not overly sweet , which is nice . as for dove , the entire process of biting into it , chewing it and swallowing it is enjoyable , so there is no contest . in summary , if you have your heart set on contributing to newman's own because of the good work they do , or you must have an organic chocolate bar , i suppose this will do . but it is not , in my opinion , any competition for any other brand of good dark chocolate i have tried . 
=================
not all that good while saving money is a key factor in purchasing this , i am basing my review on the taste of the product . overall , the coffee has a powdery taste as compared to the pre - packaged k - cups . it does not compare to the tully pre - packaged french roast that i am used to drinking . as noted by other reviewers , i don't know the eco friendliness of the packaging , since you are trading out a small plastic cup for a small plastic pouch . overall , a two star for the taste . 
=================
fair while the flavor of this dough is good , i've made it four times , for different ways , and the resulting texture isn't at all what its creators say it should be . for that reason i can't imagine it performing well as a pizza crust . as a flatbread , it's fine . regardless of how much liquid i put in the dough , the edges dry easily , like a cracker , but the middle in some cases was still doughy . so , if you just want a tasty gluten - free treat , it's great . but it doesn't perform as its intended .

premium ice cream ? yes - real gelato ? no i ordered this hoping that it was the lower fat & air than typical american style ice cream , with dense favorful gelato that you can get in shops throughout italy . what i got is delicious ice cream yes , but i can get that locally . if i let this rise to the temp gelato is at it's best to eat , it would be soupy , not silky smooth . my search for real authentic mail - order gelato continues . . .

far from the best i bought this in a store looking for a replacement for my usual brand , palanquin , and i was pretty disappointed . the bags don't have enough tea inside ; you need to use at least two to make decent cup . the black tea had a bitter tang that the spice was unable to overcome . i won't be buying this one again .

a descent tasting cookie that still disappoints . . . as an adult who occasionally enjoys a cookie or two . . . or six , i was hoping this new cookie would deliver a satisfying overload of chocolate and texture and become a household staple . and while i was pleased with some aspects of this particular cookie , it did not meet the standards i was expecting . first of all , if one really wants something named " chewy gooey megafudge " to actually taste good , they should skip the calorie counting because , in my opinion , taste has an inverse relationship with calories . so , nutritional info aside , the overall taste for a mass - packaged soft cookie was quite satisfactory . i liked the flavor of the chocolate cookie dough in combination with white - chocolate chips and the injected " fudge " and although the combination of the three sounds extremely rich , the cookies were not " heavy " or overly sweet . the first cookie easily led to a second . . . and then a third , so they did have an addictive quality to them ( maybe now caloric intake should be considered ) . while flavor is important , i predicated my overall satisfaction on other aspects like texture , packaging , value , etc . and i had some issues with the chewy gooey megafudge cookies that generated disappointment : 1 ) texture - for soft cookies , they crumble too much . it is frustrating to take a bite and have the remainder of the cookie falling apart around the fudge in the middle . additionally , the fudge was not gooey , as promised by the name . . . it was more like cake icing . 2 ) packaging - for the size of the bag , there are relatively few cookies . my first disappointment was opening the descent - sized bag of cookies only to find the plastic divider tray consuming most of the space . . . and relatively few cookies . 3 ) cookie size - this was the biggest turn - off . an addictive chocolate - chocolate chip cookie with fudge filling . . . the size of a half - dollar ? c'mon , cookies like this need to be bigger than bite - sized . the lethal combination of tiny cookies and such small quantity ( due to the packaging ) was more than enough to negate the taste for me . in fact , i ` m not sure a cookie - craving moment could be satisfied by a single bag ! increasing the size of the cookie and putting more of them into the bag would make this product a staple in my household .

stale coffee i am not a big coffee drinker . but my wife is . she has bought this in the store and really liked the coffee . i discussed with her and we thought it would be a good idea to put it on subscription . it came . she made her morning coffee and boy i heard about it . you would think someone died . and that someone could have been me ! well to make a point , it was stale . and since we opened a bag it could not be returned so now we have 4 bags of stale coffee . do yourself a favor a pass this one by . seriously . thing is i am disabled . i am not crying about that , but that means a limited income . amazon helps me to order in any items i can . recently i have had to depend on a cane because the pain is too great . the problem in a nutshell is i think there is not enough " stock rotation " in the warehouse . i had the same problem with the duracell batteries . half the package was dead . now all the other thing are fine . i love amazon . i have sold on amazon for years . good customers good people . ( personally , i tried the coffee and it was not the best but i have tasted worse . ) that's all . thank you .

i don't know what 'metallic' taste people are referring to . . . because i just had my first bottle and i couldn't taste a thing . i'm pretty sure those who are freaking out about this probably just couldn't get over the color . yes , it's a little strange drinking something that's black and has no taste to it whatsoever , but once you get past that in your mind , its really just overpriced mineral water . 
=================
corn syrup may not be a bad thing ! aight , y'all . this stuff is exactly the same as the earth's best formula . what eb doesn't want you to know is that it also contains corn syrup . eb's ingredient list includes " glucose syrup solids " instead of " corn syrup solids . " but what they don't want you to know is that it is indeed corn syrup . ( i researched and researched to find that this is true . ) so , folks , don't get your panties in a wad over corn syrup . " corn syrup solids " is not the same as " high fructose corn syrup . " it is a sweetener ( dextrose ) , and it is questionable as to whether or not it is better for you than sucrose ( table sugar found in similac organic ) . why do o and eb contain corn syrup ? well , it is to make formula sweet , like breast milk . what do other formulas use ? similac uses table sugar , and a lot of other brands use lactose - - a naturally derived sweetener from milk . lactose is arguably worse for babies , since no human processes lactose as well as dextrose or sucrose . most folks are actually lactose intolerant to some extent , so it's real rough for little babies . so the organic formulas just don't use it , and if they do , it's not in the quantities that it is in enfamil , etc . ( nature's best baby's only is the only odd man out - - they use brown rice syrup - - which is great ( ? ) but hasn't been thoroughly researched as a sugar like additive . ) the other advantage to the organic formulas like eb and o is that they have a more similar whey and casein ratio to human milk than does similac or enfamil . the first ingredient in those formulas is " non fat milk " , whereas the first ingredient in eb and o is " whey . " it's broken down more so babies can digest it better . so yeah . we didn't have success with baby's only . we lurve o and eb and parent's choice organic from walmark - - whichever is on sale , y'all ! 
=================
not the same as previous petco catnip spray i bought this because our cat just loves the petco catnip spray that we had gotten years ago . apparently something in the way they make it is not the same , because our cat sniffs and walks away . it's definitely got more of a minty smell than the other , so i'm guessing that's what she doesn't like .

tastes vaguely like watermelon i have tried two other flavors of switch and found only this one ( watermelon strawberry ) tasted anything like the name suggests . as with the other switch flavors , watermelon / strawberry is decent , but not great . as someone who loves fruit , i greatly prefer the switch over coke or sprite . however , don't let the marketing fool you . while this drink doesn't have high fructose corn syrup ( which i hate ) , it is still very high in calories and definitely not good for someone who is on a diet and looking for an alternative to regular coke . the main fruit ingredients in all switch products are grape and apple . strawberry and watermelon on the lowest fruits on the list of ingredients . overall , i enjoyed the flavor of the switch products i have tried . however , i find the advertising slightly deceptive and would have preferred it to contain fewer calories .

bugged i purchased this flour to make a quick , gluten - free biscuit recipe that a friend gave me and it has worked great for that recipe . tonight , i decided to make a peanut - butter pie for my hubbie's birthday . feeling lazy , i used the all - purpose flour to make the pie crust ( instead of mixing my own flour mixture . . . which i usually do ! ) . well . . . the garbanzo bean flour so many reviewers have complained about made the dough horribly bitter . i added some confectioner's sugar to sweeten it . i ended up with a gooey mass of something that i plopped into a pan and baked so as not to waste it ! i had to start all over again and made a cereal crust instead . double the trouble , double the mess ! that's what i get for being lazy ! anyway , the point is , this flour is great for breads , biscuits , rolls , and so forth , but not for anything sweet ! don't use it for your cakes , cookies , pie crusts , etc . you won't get the flavor you expect ! perhaps it should be renamed , " some purpose flour ! " happy baking ! update : originally , i emphasized that this flour is not for all purposes . well , now it seems it is for no purpose at all because it is full of bugs ! i keep my flour in lock 'n lock containers and none of my other flours have suffered the same fate ( in the same cupboard ) . this leads me to believe that the little buggers were already in the flour when i got it . . . i'll be looking for another flour mix now !

i didn't care for this pack 1st off , this is what is in the box : two of each per 24 pack : - parisian nights extra bold - italian blend - kona blend - breakfast blend - decaf colombian - colombian dorado - rainforest expresso extra bold - hazelnut - chai tea - english breakfast tea - green tea - lemon drinki bought this so my husband could try the teas ( he is not a coffee drinker ) . i paid about $ . 33 per k - cup which is a good price , however i thought the coffees were not that great . i prefer the green mountain brand and i suspect for me , it will be worth it to pay a little more for them .

great ingredient list , poor real - life performance with my taste - test panel i bought a case of merrick surf & turf with high hopes for my clutter of nine cats . alas , the hype didn't live up to the reality . the product is essentially a wasted purchase , as virtually none of the cats will touch the stuff . i'll be donating the rest of the case to my local animal shelter for their pet food pantry . the ingredient list drew me to the product , being grain - free , and offering a nice mix of meat and seafood , plus lots of complex carbohydrates for filler . upon opening the can , it was clear that the beef and beef fat content was pretty high , with little seafood scent detectable . it came out of the can in big globs that were sticky to try to mush down for my gang . have tried two feedings for my gang with this stuff , and they just can't be convinced that it's both tasty and good for them . i realize that different cats have different sets of taste buds and some cats will eat anything , but when none of my nine will touch the stuff , i can't recommend it to anyone with an even semi - finicky cat , as a number of my gang will eat most anything , and to find them turning up their noses at this somewhat pricey stuff is kinda eye - popping . if you're cat is very picky , but you know s / he likes beef , then this flavor will probably appeal to him / her , but otherwise , i wouldn't spend your hard - earned moolah on this stuff . save your money and your frustration . i give it two stars simply because of its relatively healthy ingredient list ; i'd otherwise give it only one star .

too expensive to buy here . formula itself is great . works wonders for a baby that spits up but wtf . . . why is it so expensive here ? $ 121 for 6 12 . 9oz cans . that's $ 20 for a 12 . 9oz can when you can buy a 24oz can at any store for less than $ 25 . almost double the price . . . i don't get it .

not gluten free . i've been gluten free for ten years . i'm o . k . enough that i can slip up a little and only get a little sick : what that means is that if something isn't entirely gluten free , it will make me sick for hours , not days . that's made me tolerant of food that isn't entirely gluten free - - i'll eat the not - entirely - gluten - free food for a couple of days , and then start having a reaction , not realizing that is what is happening . this is only sort of gluten free . you might be able to eat it a few times with only a little bit of distress , but then it will get worse . if you are a celiac on a long - standing gluten free diet , you will slowly get sicker again . and , your risk of getting colon cancer later in life will go up dramatically , which is apparently what happens to celiacs who eat little bits of gluten throughout their lives . just because it's not really making you sick , doesn't mean it's not doing damage . avoid this , and don't feed it to celiac kids . edit : on the gluten - free listservs there are discussions of people getting sick from this . erewhon has confirmed that they run oat cereals on some of the lines , so if you are a celiac who can't tolerate oats ( which i am ) this is bad stuff . also , they make this in a facility that processes wheat , so it may be legally gluten free ( 20 ppm or less ) , but not actually gluten - free . mixed facilities can have 10 ppm wheat in the air alone .

steak dust we were trying to find grill - creations steak dust made by durkee's and found amazon . com had something called durkee steak dust . it looked the same as what we had purchase at the store but i wanted to make sure so i emailed there customer service about it and sure enough they emailed me back to verify that it was the same product . my husband puts this on everything we grill , its the best tasting steak dust we ever had and the price is fanstastic . . .

protein . good . taste . bad i went ahead and ordered the cereal because i've tried the regular special k ( which tastes pretty good ) , and figured this would be like that except with protein . you can imagine my " if it sounds too good to be true . . " moment when i had my first bowl . now i'm a pretty utilitarian kind of guy , i like good food , but i can eat just about anything edible just for survival . this is what this cereal is all about . eating out of necessity . the taste is almost non - existent , which i can live with , but the texture is what kills me . all i can think about is cardboard boxes which were ripped into flakes and hardened . ( the color of the cereal doesn't convince you otherwise either ) now i don't care about high fructose corn syrup and all that , but if something tastes this bad . . . . it should at least be 100 % good for you . i don't think i will be ordering more . protein is good , but you know . . life can be rough . . . you don't need to start out each day with rough cereal

darker than it looks in picture i was disappointed when i received this brown sanding sugar . i wanted it to look like sand for decorating cupcakes in a beach theme . i passed by a lot of dark brown sanding sugar on amazon , and chose this one since it was lighter in the picture . unfortunately when it arrived , it was really dark brown .

it's saving my couches i have had this scratcher for about three months . i have been buying several scratchers over the past year because my cats like to scratch the couches . my cats do not like the smaller cardboard scratchers because they are not at an incline and they move when my cats scratch them . they also are not that interested in the turbo scratcher with the ball . at first my cats didn't warm up to this scratcher as much , although they really liked the toy . however , now they enjoy the scratcher 200 % . i also give them a treat when they scratch where they are supposed to scratch . i have been using a lot of double - sided carpet tape ( you can get it at most hardware stores in the carpet section . ) i attach it to where the cats scratch so that they get sticky paws and don't want to scratch there again . i also use it to attach this scratcher to the floor so it doesn't move when my cats scratch . try this scratcher before you try the expensive scratchers that cost $ 50 or more . also , anchor it to the floor with carpet tape .

soggy mess okay i usually love fondarific fondant and order it any time i want to splurge and save myself the work of making my own fondant . since i had a cake that i wanted to be hot pink i figured i would order some premade fondarific to avoid the hassle of trying to dye marshmellow fondant to the shade of pink i wanted . what a mess ! ! i started the cake late because i thought " hey i have fondarific and it is a cinch to roll out " wrong . the stuff was a sticky , gooey mess that kept melting away and tearing when i tried to pull it off the rolling mat . i used a ton of shortening to keep it from sticking and rolled it super thick just to compensate . it sort of worked , my cake had pock marks in the fondant from where it started to tear and stick to the mat but at 1am i was more worried about getting the dang thing covered than i was about pock marks . seriously it took me about 90 minutes to get my 2 tier cake covered where it usually would take 20 mins with fondarific . i don't know if it had to do with the pink dye in the fondant ( i have never used this dark of a pink before ) or if there was a manufacture defect with this batch of fondant . all i know is i live in washington where there is zero humidity and you would have thought i was in savannah georgia with the way it was drooping off my hands . i will not be ordering this color again any time soon . i have 3 other colors i ordered and will try out soon , will let you know if i have the same problems with them .

have been enjoying this chocolate for over 20 years , but now . . . i remember the first time i tried a lindt 70 % bar , when i visited france as a child . my parents bought several to bring back to the states , and they were cherished and eaten slowly . i've enjoyed them as a special treat ever since . sadly , that era has ended . the " new recipe " is a shadow of the former lindt chocolate . it tastes like pretty much any other standard dark chocolate bar - - none of the crisp , vibrant , complexity it used to have . i guess all good things eventually come to an end . . . too bad .

more mocha than peppermint i'm not the biggest fan of powder creamers , but coffee - mate has always been the best of all i've ever used . that being said , my wife purchased this for me to compliment the flavor of any unpleasantly cheap coffee i would subjected to while deployed overseas , and i was thankful for it . while it did the job of making plain coffee taste better , i was disappointed by the lack of peppermint flavor ( she got it for me specifically because of my love of mint ) . the smell is sweet , and you get hints of both mocha and a little peppermint . however the flavor of peppermint is lacking , and you're more or less left with a mocha creamer that only tastes slightly different than an ordinary mocha creamer . it may not completely live up to its name , but i would still recommend it .

not a bad sauce but not tikka masala at all . . . i picked this up at publix this morning to make for lunch . it is a tasty sauce , though expensive at publix ( as usual ) , but i am being totally honest here is stating that the taste resembles nothing like tikka masala . it is good though .

not so mini ! pomeranian not impressed at all ! i rarely give 1 star reviews , but how do you rate it higher if it does . . . nothing ? first of all , i was a little surprised by how large these " mini - congos " are . we have an 8 - pound pomeranian and the only reason i chose these is because of the word , " mini " . the " mini - congo " is a full inch in roundness and about 3 . 5 " long . when you go to the pet store and buy " mini " treats , they are about the size of a matchbook or so . this seriously looks like something for a medium - large sized dog . i can only imagine a regular " congo " is enormous , heh . but all dogs love bones and they all love to chew on something , right ? well our pomeranian is not impressed . he looked at it , licked it for a little bit and left it alone . we also give him these " dental sticks " and he hates them ( well he doesn't devour them like he does a real treat ) . he will lick them and put them away for awhile and if we don't give him any treats for a couple days , he'll go ahead and eat the dental stick . well it's been over a week now and he won't go near the " mini - congo " treat at all , in fact he'd rather go eat the " dental stick " he doesn't like . so it is confirmed , our dog simply does not like these , plus he can't even put his bite around it to begin with . caution - these are not so " mini " for your " mini " dog like our pomeranian . two paws down says chocco .

not worth the money . . make your own ! we were given this product as a gift . ok , i can forgive the fact that i'm a pastry chef and i was given a mix for a gift : - 0 but i have always made my own frosting from scratch and have for years . it's one of the easiest things to make ! ! ! make your cake from a mix if you want but . . . . i looked at the back of this box to see what was in it and . . . seriously it's just powdered sugar ( . 80 cents worth ) , salt ( . 05 cents worth ) and vanilla ( maybe 20 cents worth ) . i mean , i 'm glad that this small company is making themselves some money but really you should spend your money on other more difficult to make items . ( or all the medical bills that come along with the issues of gluten allergy . ) honestly folks here is all you do for awesome frosting : 1 box ( 16 oz ) of powdered sugar ( put it in a bowl ) 1 pinch salt ( put it in the bowl 1 teaspoon vanilla ( in the bowl ) 1 cup margarine ( at room temp , in the bowl ) 4 tbl soy milk or other milk ( in the bowl ) mix it all up with a mixer till it is light and fluffy ( about 5 minutes ) . . . if you want chocolate add 4 tbl of cocoa powder and another tbl of milk

kettle foods spicy thai chips the spicy thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market . however , kettle foods has changed the ingredients used , with ginger being the most important that is now missing . notice that they removed " ginger with attitude " from the bag . sadly , the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me . they aren't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non - existent . here are the original and new ingredient listings : original ingredientsselect potatoes , safflower and / or sunflower oil , honey powder ( evaporated cane syrup , honey ) salt , garlic powder , jalapeno pepper , ground ginger , onion powder , habanero pepper , dried parsley , citric acid , cilantro extract , ginger oil , cayenne pepper , white pepper , lime oil . new ingredientspotatoes , safflower and / or sunflower oil , sugar , dried cane syrup , salt , maltodextrin , yeast extract , spices , garlic powder , onion powder , dried parsley , jalapeno powder , citric acid , natural flavors , lime extracti'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner , blue diamond . they might want to get rid of " great taste naturally " from their bags as i don't consider maltodextrin to be very natural . great job kettle ! way to ruin a great thing !

one coconut water has fabulous health benefits but if you are used to sweet coconut waters the taste is not what you expect because this is 100 % coconut water ( the real deal . if you have ever had goya or el mexicano coconut waters , they are only 70 % coconut water and 30 % sugar and junk and the calorie content is around 180 . one coconut water calorie content is only 60 , no fat and it does not leave any aftertaste , just refreshing . i personally shake a pack of splenda into it . i like the variety with the splash of pineapple , passion fruit or guava too and their calorie content is not that high either and i don't put splenda in them as they are naturally sweetened . i will not buy vita brand coconut water because i found it it has celebrity investors and that right there just taints it . ( madonna and a few others have a stake in vita ) i wrote to one on their website and asked about coupons and they arrived in my mailbox about 7 days later ! they were $ . 50 off and i got my coconut water for $ . 99 . nice surprise and this type of customer service will keep me coming back to this brand .

not as bold as i prefer i have a keurig b130 , the machine you'll find in hotel rooms and commercial installations . the reservoir holds 8 oz . of water to make one cup of coffee . i prefer to put fresh water in a brewing device for every cup of coffee and use bottled water , exclusively , to brew . i like a bold , strong cup of coffee . this newman blend lacks body and strength . i compared it with using a solofill resusable k - cup , http : / / www . amazon . com / solofill - refillable - k - cup - keurig - brewers / dp / b004cxg07s / ref = sr _ 1 _ 2 ? ie = utf8 & qid = 1334324776 & sr = 8 - 2filled with cafe oquendo , http : / / www . amazon . com / cafe - oquendo - espresso - coffee - cubano / dp / b005ibv69k / ref = sr _ 1 _ 2 ? s = grocery & ie = utf8 & qid = 1334324953 & sr = 1 - 2and there was no comparison . the solofill and oquendo was far superior in flavor and strength . needless to say , using the solofill and oquendo is also substantially less expensive .

ordered in place of 5 hour . . . no replacement ! ! i have been on autoship for the 5 hour energy drinks for a while here at amazon , but this time they emailed me , on my two subscriptions that they couldn't fill them . . . and they suggested i try the red rain that customers buy this many times instead . so i did . i read some of the reviews . . . tastes better , lasts longer , etc . so thought i'll give it a shot . i don't want to totally shoot them down ~ they're not awful , and they are cheaper than the 5 hour energy drink . . . but you know they saying you get what you pay for ? yup , in this case it holds true . i didn't find them to taste any better , in fact i really liked the berry taste less , but regardless it's not a great tastes no matter how you look at it . but what i really found lacking was the boost . while it does give you that initial energy boost , it's not as fast or as great as that you get from the 5 hour drink , and it does not last anywhere near 5 hours ! i have to drink 2 in the time i'd drink 1 5 hour , and still find myself dragging . i work the graveyard shift , so alertness is sometimes something i have to trick my body into . . . it really aint gonna happen w / thisred rain energy shot . in my opinion , it was a waste of my money .

very good , could be a bit better . so far i've only tried the orange tangerine flavor and it's pretty good overall . it does have a tangerine taste to it , though it's accompanied by other flavors . it's clearly much more natural than regular soda or those 10 % juice drinks since it's just fruit juice concentrates and carbonated water vs . the typical high fructose corn syrup plus artificial flavors , colors and preservatives in something like sunkist . i think the juice blend is appropriate for this type of beverage . it does contain more apple and grape than tangerine or orange , but those first two juices complement the carbonation well viz a viz sparkling cider . i think straight carbonated orange / tangerine juice would probably be a bit much . the switch reminds me of appletiser , which is one of my favorites and has been around for many years , but is still pretty hard to find in the us . that having been said , i had to dock one star for a couple of reasons . first , the cans just seem too small . if they're sticking with aluminum cans , i'd like to see the standard 12oz size offered . it seems like that would also have the advantage of making it easier to offer in regular beverage vending machines . alternately , 16 or 20oz bottles would also work . the second issue is the price . while i understand there's a huge difference between the cost of real juice and artificially flavored corn syrup , the current price still seems high , even in comparison to other juice drinks . that might be partly because it's from a relatively small company that doesn't yet have the giant economies of scale that the likes of coke and pepsi can take advantage of , but it still seems like the price could come down a bit ( or at least serving size could increase without a price increase ) and it could perhaps still be made back up in increased sales volume . i pick up appletiser when i can find it , and i'll likely do the same with the switch , at least from time to time .

availability and pricing cafe verona is my favorite of the starbucks coffees and i was delighted to see it available in k kups ; however , i do not understand why the price is so high on amazon when it's available at costco for $ 34 . 95 for the 54 count package . this price difference boggles my mind . i've also noticed the starbucks kkups available in grocery stores for a lower price per unit than amazon . this is why i gave the product one star only .

something has changed . . . i've eaten this product for years due to a wheat allergy . i loved it so much that i convinced my non - gluten sensitive friends to eat it ( and they love it ) . for years , i ate it at least once per week . . . . until this last batch . i'm not sure what is different but this batch of pasta makes me very sick . i wasn't sure it was the pasta . the first time i cooked it , i blamed the broccoli i added . the next time , i must have undercooked the chicken . the next time , it was the pepper flakes' fault . then , the added garlic . while working through the pack of 12 , i eventually developed an aversion to it from getting so sick and started eating it only once per month . the last few times . . . again , sick . so , today , i tried it just the pasta and water , nothing else . . . and sure enough , very sick . i won't get descriptive but i am suddenly very , very sensitive to something in the pasta . i am 100 % certain it is the pasta since i become sick within hours of eating it . i am also positive i have never , not in years of regular consumption , had this type of reaction before this batch . i just wanted to put it out there in case anyone else has a similar reaction to whatever has changed . i scanned the boxes , just now , to make sure i accidentally didn't get shipped a gluten case and noticed that this is new packaging . so , maybe they changed the recipe with the colors / art on their box . either way , i won't be eating this again and it's a shame b / c it was such a versatile tool in an otherwise limited cross section of gluten free foods that my " typical " friends will eat .

i lost weight with this ! if you're looking to increase your daily fiber intake , you should try this cereal . i've been losing weight gradually with this , and my stomach doesn't look as bloated as before . i've been eating this cereal mixed with my favorite cereal to make it tastier and it's been reducing my constipation . my canadian version has sucralose ( splenda ) in it so less cavities ( bacteria can't break this sugar down ) .

is it stale ? like a few other reviewer here , i noticed right away after opening the bag ( cinnamon oat clusters ) that it smelled like stale grains or stale peanuts . it's a pretty strong odor but it wasn't overpowering . since i am not familiar with some of the grains in the bag , i thought maybe they have some distinct odors that are similar to what i assume is a stale smell . for reference , i know the smell of flax seed , oats , and rice , and they smell nothing like what i was smelling from this bag . despite the strange smell , i still tried a few bites , and the taste wasn't too bad but i know it would have been better without that lingering smell . just like the others who have complained , the expiration date on my bag is august 29 , 2012 , so the product should have still been good . also , like others , i felt that there really weren't many clusters as the picture on the product shows . the lack of larger clusters makes it harder to be a hand snack but you can still pour it in a cereal bowl and add milk . previously i have enjoyed kind products , so this experience won't prevent me from trying other kind products . however , i may be hesitant to try this particular product again . i'll be glad to change my review though if kind sends me another bag - - and it doesn't have that peculiar smell .

concept ? great . performance ? blah . not being a food chemist , i'm not sure what the deal is here with vegan and vegetarian " meats . " i really like most veggie - based patties , " chicken " bits , and breakfast sausages . however , the various " brats " that i so desperately want to grill are , for the most part , terrible . and i don't just mean " not meat - like . " i mean , they don't taste very good . the food chemists at the famous monell chemical senses center have , as i remember , " hamburger in a vial . " that is , with your eyes closed , they can fool you into thinking there is a grilled hamburger in front of your face , when in reality it is a combination of chemicals they have isolated from this product . so how hard can it be to really simulate the flavor of bratwurst ? in this case , it's jerky . it kinda looks okay ( needs more imperfections . . . lumps and bumps ) , has somewhat the same consistency ( you gotta pull hard or break off a piece ) , and , as far as the " original hickory pepper " flavor , you can tell it has pepper . but that first bite made me think of those veggie brats . not a good association . i guess this just needs to be an acquired taste . i do appreciate the effort . . . the vegan product , the non - gmo soy , and the low - fat ( in this case , 0 grams of fat ) product . but can't those monell scientists work up a vial of " jerky taste and smell ? " i'll be waiting .

ok for an alternative snack purchased this variety pack and although i was very impressed with amazon prime shipping ( i literally received it in less than 24 hours ! ) , the snack itself is average tasting . mostly like flavorless cardboard . the best flavor is the jalapeno one , pretty spicy . it satisfies the crunch and salt factor , but no way is this a replacement for real chips . i recommend popchips original flavor which reminds me of munchos , or popchips bbq flavor ; both are satisfying and taste very good . i would not purchase these gourmet basics smart fries again . i even joked with my co - workers when they asked me what i was eating . . " they're smart fries , but they're not so smart since they don't taste that good ! " they tasted for themselves and they all pretty much agreed with me .

reformulated version much worse than before when this product became a " helper complete meal " instead of just a regular " complete meal " , they reformulated the topping , which used to be a breadcrumb - based parmesan - cheese blend . the new topping is literally just parmesan cheese , and not a lot of it , and the product is notably worse off for it . overall , the flavor is very mild , not " alfredo " at all , but it is still reasonably tasty and the chicken tastes pretty good . the overall flavor is a generic creamy chicken dish with some hints of cheese . it is , however , a delusion to suggest it feeds 4 - the amount of chicken is enough for 2 ( or maybe 2 adults + 1 child ) . what is there is indeed easy to make , and tastes pretty good for a thing out of a box . if you're just running out of steam but still want something with some 'comfort food' vibe , then this is ok . however , if you're looking for a high - quality meal , look elsewhere . the mexican - style version of this with the rice is much better tastewise , for the same price .

why the change ? this is the only food that has worked for my dog , and then they started adding a bunch of other ingredients that don't seem necessary . the point of a hypo - allergenic food is to have one protein and one carb . suddenly there's quinoa and kamut flakes . i don't think they're too much of an issue ( yet ) , but the inclusion of apples is a definite problem . now i need to find another hypo - allergenic food . . . .

taste is gone in minutes i think the licorice flavor is very weak and the gum is almost flavorless in about 10 minutes . other people seem to disagree with me so maybe i have been ruined by eating too much really strong licorice over the years . i still enjoy the gum though so i will continue to buy it .

grnd coarse blk pepper the 16 - oz unit of ground black coarse pepper was fresh and arrived well . the double pack however is too much for one household , recommend it be sold in single 16 - oz units .

cannot get good roast i have previously ordered various green coffee bean types from a couple websites with good roasting success . i decided to try this product on amazon for its good price and free shipping . however , i've tried various degrees of roasting from very light to very dark and cannot get this coffee to taste good . there just seems to be no flavor . i use a nesco cr - 1000 .

still searching . . . . i am searching for a different mix this time . the brownies taste great , but the frosting is weird tasting . it almost has a coffee flavor . . . which is not intentional or tasty . i like the brownies , but hate throwing out the frosting each time . plus , these take over 40 minutes to bake and i want something i can throw together more quickly .

i am unable to split these capsules for a half serving ; - ( my family is very sensitive to everything . lots of allergies , overly sensitive to prescriptions , etc . so , we regularly cut the dose in half of most things we use as a precaution . in fact when i drink juice , i dilute it 60 - 75 % with water - just becuase the flavors are so strong to me . so , i purchased these and planned to split these into smaller servings . i was going to use my empty gel caps which i keep at home to be able to split them . but , they do not use standard size gel caps ! ! i have always been able to use standard o , 1 , 2 or 3 size capsules which i get from my local pharmacy . but these dehydrated water capsules must be imported , since they do not fit any of the standards us sizes . i am afraid to use the entire capsule all at once due to my very sensitive nature , so i can't really comment on its strength or it's flavor . but if you are interested in splitting the serving size down i recommend you find an american source for these - as these can not be split . jk : - )

dinosaur chew toy my dog loved chewing on this dinosaur toy but after a couple of months he managed to finely shred it to the point that about 20 % of it was missing / ingested . it didn't seem to cause any digestive problems but was disconcerting nonetheless . we've had better luck with another nylabone product , the double action combo bone chew toy , which is still going strong after 4 + years .

this is not gluten - free and should not be in the gluten - free list of cereals ! although amazon has this cereal ( nature's path hemp granola gluten free ) in the " gluten - free " specialty section , the manufacturer does not consider it to be gluten - free due to the presence of oats that are non - gf certified . i'm sure the cereal is quite good , but because i assumed that amazon was careful in assigning items to the gluten - free list , i bought it and now can't eat it . please be cautious when purchasing " gluten - free " items from amazon and always check with the manufacturer if in doubt . amazon , please take note of this and make the correction ! enough already ! 
=================
needs more variety this is a fairly decent package with an uneven distribution . instead of receiving 10 cups of each product as one might anticipate , the box has twice the number of cups of frosted flakes and about six cups of cocoa puffs . unfortunately , the raisin bran crunch is the spoiler in this package . the raisins are tough , difficult to chew , and lay on the bottom of the cup so don't expect to find any raisins until the cereal is just about gone .

yuk ! ! ! ! if you like the flavor of cardboard , then you will like this because that's what it tastes like . i like coffees that are strong flavored . . . this is not it as it has little flavor at all . i guess the saying is true . . . " you get what you pay for " price is cheap and it tastes cheap . i'm sorry i bought it . please contact me if you would like one opened can and one sealed can and i'll give it to you for free . actually , i wouldn't want to give this to a homeless person because i'd hate to put them through the unpleasant taste . surprising to see some people said they like it . wish i could have agreed with them . opened one of the cans , it didn't even leave an aroma which was my first clue that it would probably not even have a pleasant taste . then i tried several varied amounts in the brewing process thinking that eventually i would get a decent tasting cup of coffee . . . . . no such luck ! ! ! i ordered based on the other reviews here on amazon . worst coffee i've ever tasted and comes close to the taste of coffee aboard some navy ships where the coffee has been brewing for about 5 hours or more . i strongly recommend others to avoid this brand and try something else . i normally like to use whole beans and ground them myself . . . this is the first step to making truly flavorful coffee . if you use paper filters , let a cup of water run through them then empty the carafe and then put your freshly ground beans in the filter and brew . this process takes out the mill - dust that all paper filters have in them which will taint the flavor of the coffee if you don't do this process . as for store brand coffee , i would recommend the selection at kroger called spotlight or the other called private select . a good non generic store brand coffee is community coffee . if you are fortunate to have a central market grocery store near you , try the fine selection of whole bean coffees .

read the ingredients ! i think the ratings for mori - nu tofu would not be so high if more people were actually aware of what's in it . mori - nu's tofu contains soy protein isolate , a highly processed form of soy . as a busy student cooking for myself most nights , i'm always looking for grocery products that will make putting dinner on the table more convenient . but while i was intrigued by the shelf - stability of mori - nu tofu , i'm definitely not counting on it as a staple - - tofu is considered healthy because it is a fermented soy product , but the soy protein isolate in mori - nu's tofu puts it in the category of processed soy , the kind that will mess with your endocrine system if consumed it regularly . this means if you're eating tofu for the health benefits , you may as well look elsewhere . what i've learned is that most tofus packed in water have expiry dates two months ahead ( unopened ) so you'll only need to replenish your supply every 1 1 / 2 - 2 months . sure , this would save me space in the fridge and i could stock up on a year's worth of tofu if i really wanted to ( and i might want to , but a year's worth of tofu is hardly a necessity ) . but the bottom line is i'm just unwilling to make this highly processed food a staple , particularly when versions that are truly healthy are readily available .

i hate to give proflower one star but it's the lowest score available i love facebook . i am just one person but i sent a message out about the insulting message i received from this company in response to my email request to sever ties with rush limbaugh . i reached over 7 , 000 people in minutes and i already have hundreds of comments from people who will never shop proflowers again no matter what they do going forward . i am not surprise they defended his remarks as they seem to be cut from the same cloth . if you have any respect and love for the women in your life then click that little red " x " in the upper right corner of your screen , pick up he phone and order from your local florists !

smells like chicken ! , not like cat food at all . : o ) i wish my cats would eat this . one cat will lick up all the liquid , eat some of the shredded chicken but not all . bummer cause this is the cleanest canned cat food i've come across . from the smell you'd never think this was a cat food . unfortunately petco only had the good karma chicken dinner adult canned cat food in gravy ( . 99 per can ) or i would have gotten all of their offerings . i've recently taken in ( or been taken in by ) a stray and he will not eat anything but safeway's mom - to - mom chicken baby food , and california natural chicken and brown rice dry . weird and totally frustrating . which is how i came across this soulistic btw . my other cat has been getting real finicky for the past couple of yrs .

great flavor but very oily i followed the direction and got a very oily sauce sauce . if this is the way it should be i will consider a different product nest time . however the flavor was excellent and just the right amount of heat . i added frozen peas to this dish and despite its oily appearance came out delicious . if the company is reading this i would recommend either creating a recipe with less fat or a product with less fat . in the meantime i think i'll stick to tikki masala and kashmiri curry sauces .

great ingredients but dogs wont eat it ! i saw this online and was very impressed with the ingredients so i ordered it but my dogs wont eat it . even the one who eats everything wont eat it . i was hoping they would love it since it looked very healthy and it's really expensive but it was a big flop !

so many mixed reviews . . i was really excited and surprised when i found this mix in my local wal mart . given it was a good price , i figured id give it a shot . . . . before i whipped up a batch i figured id do a little investigating to see if there was any input / suggestions on the mix . wow . is everyone using the same mix or what ? reviews from " its great " to " its horrible " . . like a total 50 / 50 split . soooooo , before i wasted a bunch of money on products to whip up a batch and see for myself , i figured id simply open the packae up and take a taste to the mix , all on its own . . . . ummmmm , yeah . it totally has a pretty strong bitter after taste . : / and , like another reviewer , i had figured this mix would be adequately sweet enough for me and not need any extra sweetener ( i dont like things very sweet , at all ) but its def not . as i re read the ingredients i realized there isnt any sugar / sweetener in this mix so , youd def need to add sweetening . but , overall , i dont even plan on taking this mix that far . im pretty certain that adding sugar wont take that aftertaste away . thats an issue with the flour mix and no amount of sugar is going to make that go away . . . . . id strongly suggest avoiding this mix . . . . i hope the company works on this mix . it has good elements to it ( i like the fact you can determine how sweet youd want it and the apple pieces are pretty tasty ) and i think it could be really tasty . 
=================
use caution when ordering ! the quality of the product is great and exactly as described . however , the two boxes i received were previously opened before they were shipped and were both haphazardly repackaged with packing tape . the boxes were also stamped to expire a few months after receiving it and while the product is ultra - pasteurization and the quality should be okay post - expiration date , i would be very careful when ordering from this vendor / company .

eeeyuck ! i bought a case of these because our city was threatened with high flooding last summer , and i thought i'd make better preparations for my home just in case there may be a repeat situation next year . and , this was my first try at buying foods online as well . i wish i could leave a better review for this item since i really do like this brand of vienna sausage , but when my package arrived about an hour ago and i opened up the carton to inspect it for any dented cans , i came across the occasional can that had * dead dried maggots * laying on the top ! i didn't see any obvious dented cans or compromised seals that could have attracted these critters and the cans didn't put out any " off " smell that could have indicated a bad can , so i'm baffled to how they got there . all i can say about ordering any food online is " caveat emptor " . i'm certainly going to be a bit more paranoid about it in the future .

creamers burst during transit - sticky read through the other reviews and you will find the same situation i had with the creamers . it does not arrive in the blue dispenser box that is shown , the 192 creamers arrive loose inside a cardboard box with no padding . perhaps less creamers would burst during transit if the display box shown was wrapped inside a cardboard box . the box arrived completely undamaged on the outside . none appeared to have frozen during transit , it appears that the creamer singles pop during high altitude transit or perhaps when the box is thrown by the shipper or pressure is placed on the box . it is a sticky mess when it arrives . the creamer taste and convenience is great , but it is unfortunate that so many people have commented on this problem and interational delight has not fixed its packaging and shipping issue .

manufacturer put wrong food in can ! because of all the good reviews about blue buffalo dog food , i've been using this ( expensive ) dog food for about 6 months . i have 2 large dogs so sometimes i go through 5 cans a day . i've mostly purchased through amazon . this past order , i opened a can of chicken pot pie which is supposed to be 'chunk' style with clearly identifiable peas , potatoes , etc . this time , i opened a can and it was mush food . not knowing how it got messed up in the processing plant , i did not feed it to my dogs ( thus losing the $ 2 . 30 that i paid for the can ) . i immediately went to amazon . com and blue buffalo and wrote to their customer service departments about this . neither company has contacted me back and that was 3 weeks ago ! so , i decided to start randomly opening the other cans ( they all came in one 12 - can carton that was wrapped in plastic ) to see if all the cans were wrong . fortunately , they were not wrong so somehow the company mislabeled one of the cans during processing . the reason that this could be extremely dangerous for us is if it was beef as one of my dogs has so many bowel issues after eating beef that i only give him poultry and fish products . luckily , i did not feed them this can and threw it away . however , this has tarnished my trust in this company . at the very least , either amazon or blue buffalo should have responded to my concerns . i've been waiting to get an email asking for my 'review' because i feel this is the only forum that will give any attention to this potential problem that other people could experience . my dogs are precious to me and i go to great lengths to exercise and nourish them which means i have to put trust in other companies to help me do just that . i'm now looking for homemade dog food receipes and have started making some myself this past week . i hope this was helpful to you .

shipped fast , no weight specified i received the shipment quickly ; however , i was a little disappointed when i opened the box as it was only a 5 ounce package . i bought another color of sprinkles from a different company , paid the same price and got 16 ounces . the seller did not specify in the description how many ounces was included in the price . i took the risk because i needed the sprinkles and couldn't find them . i will know next time to ask the question before purchasing .

surprised at sugar content i picked these up at the health food store - as the dr . sears reccommendation caught my eye . my eight month old son immensely enjoyed them , and i looked at the ingredients and was really surprised to find sugar listed second , right after the cultured milk . it is organic sugar yes , but still added sugar - and i'm bummed as this was not something that i wanted to introduce to his diet yet . my fault that i was swayed by advertising , and didn't read the back .

great yummy product , insane price ! i have been eating the pik - nik shoestring potatoes ever since i was a kid . i always liked them better then potato chips . i can buy these in the store but since my family eats a lot of these i was hoping to get a good deal thru amazon . not ! ! ! the price for these when shipping is added does not make for a good deal ! matter of fact , i'd consider these at $ 40 . 16 for a case of 12 , from the distributor that is carrying them , to be a huge rip _ off ! that makes each 9 oz . can cost $ 4 . 16 each ! ! ! i can buy the same size can at my local market for 2 . 49 each . so don't get ripped off with this one folks ! remember , the product is great , the price is not !

taste is extremely unpalatable . . . i haven't been taking this supplement long enough to confidently say that it's made a huge difference in my energy level but i haven't seen any negative side effects so i've continued with it hoping to see a difference soon . however , one thing i can confidently say about it is that the taste is so unappetizing that i have a hard time drinking it . there's a cloying sweetness to it that is reminiscent of cherry flavored cough syrup , only it's green and in powder form . . .

cat loves but it makes her throw up i've been buying thus for my cat for about 6 months now . she's always had a bit of a problem with throwing up so i didn't notice itr at first . but now that i've had a few months of experience with it i can confirm that it makes her throw up . i would say 7 out of 10 times she throws up not even after , but while she's eating it ! at first i didn't think anything about it , i thought she was just randomly throwing up . but today i noticed she threw up while she was near finishing what i had put down for her . so just as a test i decided to give her a little more and she threw up in less than a minute of eating it . so , i don't know what to tell you . maybe it's just my cat . i can't imagine they sell this and it happens to every car ! my cat is 16 and in really good health considering her age . but maybe it's age related , i don't know . i just know i won't bed able to give her this anymore . but i'm going to have to find a good substitute fast because she's so addicted to it , she starts yelling for more every day at the same time ! !

not what it claims or a bit deceptive we tried this product , a bunch of us . and we are all vegetarian . we also do not like onion or garlic ; one of the friends esp . is sensitive to this . well , even calling the company , they are not forthcoming , because we could taste garlic in it , and compared to " tasty eats " soy jerky , this does not even compare . so first , the ingredient " vegetarian spices " includes granulated garlic powder , possibly onion . in ayurvedic terms , this is not sathwic for one's body . we totally recommend the soy jerky by tasty eats . we ordered six cases of the ginger . they use no onion or garlic in any of their products . most companies do list " spices " but they will almost always label garlic or onion powder separately . this company who makes the primal strips does not . after all the comparisons , we found tasty eats soy jerky to be the best taste , quality and texture . in fact , they are out of teriyaki , their best selling jerky , the original flavor , peppered and hot n' spicy . but we will order cases of them when they become available . they provide a first class jerky that is healthy and proper for everyone ; esp . vegans and vegetarians .

new recipie is not as good as the original this used to be awesome . . . the dumplings were soft little morsels , the broth was creamy and rich , and the flavor was unstoppable . then they went " organic . " it's not nearly as flavorful as it used to be and the only real spice you can taste is black pepper . it still beats campbells , but for one fatal flaw , i simply can't recomend it anymore : this reformulation has the worst dumplings ever . they're hard , rubbery , flat slices off a larger " dumpling stick . " the texture isn't entirely different from octopus or a really dense soy . overall do i like it ? yes . would i recommend it ? no .

fixed i ordered this for my boyfriend for father's day . the food was disgusting . we didn't even bother trying the " black taffy " , which was nothing more than very bad licorice . the next were some kind of nuts with a sweet shell around them . they were disgusting . they had no flavor and what flavor they did have tasted a bit like dirt . the next two things were chocolate chip cookies and some other type of cookie . we figured how bad can they screw up a chocolate chip cookie . . . . well they were dry and tasted horrible . i ended up throwing out everything , and you have to understand we don't throw out food , at all . i was terribly disappointed . i just figured that i trusted amazon , so i should be able to trust the products they sell . this was not the case . after leaving complaint with this company they refunded my money and were very helpful .

large , but not 'boba tea' large good - tasting tapioca , but definitely not the size for boba tea . you can maximize their size by letting them soak for several hours and then boiling them ( or the opposite order ) ; this size is acceptable for boba tea , but not optimal .

the sweetener seems to be of average quality . the sweetener seems to be of average quality . the cost is more expensive than at the local store . so if you have a hard time getting this where you live it may work out for you but please compare the price at the local grocery before buying . thank you for your time .

wish it had worked this food has such high ratings , i wish it had worked . i have a black lab / weim mix who is over 2 year olds and about 100 lb . as he aged ( turned 2 in april ) his ears kept getting worse and worse with black smelly gunk and nothing the vet gave helped . he also started chewing feet and legs ( made a bare spot on one leg ) . after researching i decided it must be food allergies . i changed to dr . e's great life grain free potato free limited ingredient buffalo - worked great ears cleared up . no foot / leg chewing , skin wasn't shedding white flakes as much . but . . . he hated it . he would dribble pieces on the floor - i had to mix it with stuff ( i'm just not the type who will starve my dog till he eats ) . he also leaned up quite a bit though he wasn't an overweight dog . i figured since his ears were clear but he hated this , i would try this food as it sounded so good . what a disaster . he loved it . gobbled it down and wanted more . he gained weight ( not in a good way now he looks fat ) , his ears got stinky , his feet got itchy and his skin was so dry and flaky he looked like a partially white dog and his hair was flying out in handfuls . am going to keep looking as i don't think i can keep feeding him the other as it was such a struggle but really disappointed this didn't work . as a side note , we were at the bottom of the barrel with his old food and i didn't do a two week intro as i usually do , plus his probiotics had run out but he had zero diarreah issues switching over to this . i did mix it with grandma lucy's grain free chicken dog food but he was having that on his food before and was cleared up so i don't think that was it . also , some have mentioned not to mix this with water so i'm glad he didn't have bloat issues though i did ( as the grandma lucy's is a dry flake you rehydrate )

enough transfat to stop a train in its tracks ; enough sugar to induce diabetic shock , enough flour to block an artery but that irresistible dickensian odor as it warms . . . british culinary experience is not world noted . from london's bangers and mash to liverpool's scouse to glasgow's haggis , this isle of bad teeth is not normally sought for its kitchen fare . and so within this small can it comes to us . in dickens we read of the ravenous appetites consuming the most bizarre items , of tiny tim's bag of lard boiled with brandy and a plum , of whatever it was fagin gave his small boys in london's slums . here we share a taste of those delights . do not let this discourage you . let a can of this sit ( opened ) in a pan of bubbling hot water , alongside a can of evaporated milk . this in itself makes an adequate holiday pot - pourri , filling your house with cozy warmth , and this is undoubtedly the only safe manner to consume it : olfactory rather than gustatory , considering the transfats , sugars and flour . ( remember my child the warm mothering spirit of adele davis , she of let's eat right to keep fit , warning us of the three white poisons : salt , sugar and refined flour , oh yeah and fats ) . yet , for those who truly find this " to die for " place the pudding on one bowl , pour the milk on top , add extra cinnamon , and as desired , honey or molasses over all , and enjoy . best thing since indian pudding !

great ( compared to other instant coffees ) i rarely drink instant coffee , but sometimes go to rural india on medical trips . outside of starbucks cafes and large western style hotels ( in all cities , but not in rural india ) it is nearly impossible to get brewed coffee in india . ask for coffee , and you get instant , everywhere in india ( except as noted ) . anyway , to get a coffee fix on the go , i've tried the starbucks via columbia packets , and ( for instant coffee ) they are wonderful , won't fool you into thinking you've got a good cup of brewed coffee , but better than common western office coffee , and much better than the instant served in rural india . the starbucks packs cost 75 cents to $ 1 each , and i was hoping the nescafe clasico packs would be nearly as good , at 1 / 8 the price . unfortunately , not . if you want something that reminds you of brewed coffee , bite the bullet and pay for the starbucks .

not as good as before saw this in the grocery store recently and was very excited . as a fan of the previous fruit filled version , i was eager to try a bowlful as soon as i got home . the mixed berry flavor was very sweet & artificial , and by the time i'd eaten less than half the bowl i'd had enough . the flavors from before like strawberry and raisin tasted very fruity and complimented the frosted shredded cereal perfectly . when there is already frosting on the top side of the square , the filling doesn't need to be super sweet . it tasted like a frosted mixed berry pop tart , so i'm sure kids and younger folk will be a fan on this cereal , and perhaps that is who it is marketed to now . 
=================
half filled my first time ordering / using this product as i am restocking for my seasonal / holiday baking . hoping i'm not going to be disappointed how ever i'm confused about the size of the apple pie spice , it's in a 16oz bottle but the label says 8oz when i compare it to the 8oz bottle of pumpkin pie spice it's about 2 - 3 oz less . i intend to contact the seller about this matter because i have more items in my cart i want to purchase , hoping i don't have to change my mind of course . i will keep you posted on the outcome . 
=================
warning - open mesh coffee pods , not k - cups i've urged amazon to change this product's listing so as not to trick anyone else into buying it , but until they do , i want to add my voice to the revelations hidden in a few reviews that are already here . please be warned that while the first cup of this coffee is tasty , the second is unlikely to be as good , and the twelfth is almost guaranteed to be disappointing unless you're the twelve - cup - a - day sort of household . why ? simply put , these are not k - cups . they are not individually sealed portions , but instead are open mesh coffee pods , not dissimilar to senseo pods , topped with a k - cup - like plastic ring and foil cover . that cover does make them work in keurig brewers , but you lose the important freshness - preserving feature of k - cups . the company could lessen this problem by putting its pods in a resealable plastic bag , but they chose to instead use a plastic bag reminiscent of those in cereal boxes - - just much , much harder to open . that's especially ironic given amazon's recent move toward frustration - free packaging . i strongly encourage you to move on to another product until the san francisco bay coffee folks can temper their ( laudable ) green - focused pod design with some reasonable solution for keeping the coffee fresh for more than a day or so once you open the box . 
=================
never received it i received half of my order , this product was never received . my experience with the product in general is fantastic ; the dogs love it and the time it took them to adjust to their new food was only a few days . it doesn't have an overwhelming smell and it's a fair price . 
=================
good , but not as advertised this is a fairly good asst . of teas , but they sent me an updated version of the product , and i'm not happy with the new asst . it's not as described in the desc . it has pomegranite tea instead of apple cinnamon , and i was buying it to get the apple cinnamon , so i hope someone reads this and doesn't make the same mistake i did . i want my apple cinnamon tea
=================
expansive expansive about the quality it is same as available at any other store , but it is much expansive here so i advise just to visit your local walmart and buy it from there
=================
communication between distributors ? communication problem between amazon and distributor , who has what . product great . price great . problem , only half , ( 12 bottles ) of the order showed up after full payment . when inquired at both amazon and manufactuer , i played middle man to resolve the issue . amazon offerd to pay for the other half of the order or i could return the product . i do not want to return the product , its not the product i dont like , just make it happen so that the rest of the order is here timely . end result , i kept the 12 bottles and was refunded the other 12 . product not the problem . not resolving the problem is . 
=================
a wonder a friend of mine recommended this product to me . she said she'd lost 20 lbs in a matter of months just from using it . i was skeptical , to say the least . i'd heard all of the bad stuff about coconut oil , but i was curious enough to research . in the meantime , another acquaintance told me about a mutual friend who'd lost 75 lbs from using nutiva . after that , i was more than curious - - i wanted to try it . i'd tried a different brand of coconut oil before and was not impressed . it was very grainy and hard . nutiva is very smooth . it's got a beautiful creamy texture and is very white . it also doesn't leave a smoky smell in my home - - in fact , i love the way it smells when i'm sauteeing food . what sold me on this product was that i read you could eat it on toast . i thought that was weird , but decided to give it a try . the first time i tried it like that , i had meetings all day . i am always hungry , and always snacking . i really eat about every 2 hours . well , that day , about 5 hours had gone by before i realized i was hungry ! i thought it was a fluke since i was so busy that day . a few days later , i tried it again . and once again , several hours went by and i wasn't a bit hungry . i am convinced there is something to weight loss with this product . i've already lost 15 lbs in the month that i've used it . i would ( and have ) recommend this product to everyone . 
=================
not so perfect tea everything about this product is perfect , price , ease of use , portion size . everything except the taste . not as strong as other brands , which is fine , but the acidic / lemony aftertaste is too much to bear . very disappointed . 
=================
head to the drug store and buy some pretzels . you'll be better off . the presentation is top notch but the quantity and selection of treats is awful . i gave this and a ferrero rocher 48 piece gift box to somebody . their face lit up upon opening the ferrero rocher , but there was no similar face - joy upon opening this gift tower only to find a small bag of popcorn and a couple little handfuls of other bits . also , the ferrero rocher costs less . this gift box set would be a decent deal for $ 5 at a drug store just b / c of the great presentation / packaging . but you could buy its contents for only a few bucks . if presentation is what counts , buy this for sure ! ( i did not sample any of the goods , so i can not comment on quality . ) 
=================
expensive why is this so expensive ? the average price i have seen for this exact product is $ 4 . 99 . i have never seen it for anywhere near this price . 
=================
dried out mega bone ! when i received this product it was old and dried out ! dingo makes a good product . i buy them all the time and my dog loves them but this supplier should pay more attention to what they ship . 
=================
how can dark chocolate disappoint ? i was really disappointed with these cookies . i love anything dark chocolate , and the fact that they're organic was a big plus when i was contemplating the purchase . however , some of the previous reviewers were right - they are over the top sweet ( and i've never felt this way about any other cookies , especially dark chocolate ones ) . i've never tried gluten free cookies before , so maybe that's why they don't taste as good as i expected . usually chocolate cookies go very fast at our house , but i still have most of the box sitting around . 
=================
more sweet than salty was hopeing it was more salty . the bag opens and rips easily . once open it needs to be poured into a zip lock quart sized bag . some saltiness but more sweet than i was expecting . i'm ordering a different brand next time w / hopes of a saltier flavor . it's good for what it is . . . downgraded because of the poorly designed bag . it can't be resealed and usu makes a mess . 
=================
pricey , but may be worth it my 16 year old cat has been eating this dry food exclusively for the past month . he's regained some lost weight and voraciously awaits the next scoop . this food even smells more like " real food " than any other dry cat food i've used . 
=================
awesome colors , but note the set # 2 part ! i'll go into more detail as i try the various shades . i lovelovelove gel food coloring ! they don't get funky tasting and not being liquid , it doesn't changethe consistency of the food you are putting them in . that being said , just pay close attention to this listing . truly , i was just looking for a 12 - pc set and thought they were all the same . they aren't ! notice what i didn't notice - set # 2 . the colors listed are exactly what i received , so that part is great . but i was looking to get a base of more basic colors and build on that . i already had black , or i would have been very ticked that it wasn't in this set . ( and it would have been my fault for not reading more carefully ) . so , just pay attention to what colors you are buying in any given listing . they are all good , and i certainly won't return them . however , i also wasn't truly looking for many of the colors in this set . 
=================
canceling my shipment i order the 192 box of these every month . i'll get them the same time of the month for a couple of months and then they send me an email that they have canceled my order due to payment problem and i have to reorder and loose a month . i don't understand since i havent changed my address , card number or anything . does anyone else have this problem ? 
=================
impossible to open ! this is a fantastic product , and has the benefit of being useful for travel . the product is unlikely to clump because it has a plastic liner which keeps it dry . however , this plastic liner makes the packet impossible to open without scissors ! and who travels with scissors ? this product could be greatly improved if there was an easy - open slit in the packaging , and would be more environmentally - friendly without the plastic . people who are interested in their health might also be interested in a more * green * product . i also will not buy this product again in its current state . it really boggles the mind that they would put this into convenient , portable packets , then make it so maddeningly difficult to open the packets . packaging fail .

familia muesili excellent cereal . dense , stick to your ribs . oats & nuts . no added sugar or junk . difficult to find in stores in some locales .

love cracker . . . most of them were broken over half the crackers in each of all six boxes were broken . i want to spread different things on these crackers and can't with pieces . i love the crackers though . i'll just have find somewhere to buy them where the breakage isn't so severe that i feel ripped off . obviously i won't be ordering them again here . 
=================
makes our dog sick . . be advised made in china . . . so we've purchased this product ( not from amazon ) for our scottish terrier and he ate them with gusto . but he has gotten violently ill several times after eating them . regrettably as much as he loves them we're not going to give them to him anymore . he was very ill and i've never seen a dog throw up like these made him . usually our dog throws up whatever makes him sick and moves on none the less for wear . . . these however had him shaking and projectile vomiting , and whimpering and crying in pain . . we were very scared for him . . . as a matter of fact he just got sick and that's what made us write this . . . we are watching over him right now as he pulls himself together . in any event , unfairly or not , anything foodstuff made in china is suspect and these are made in china . we are not going to purchase these again and would recommend strongly that no one else purchase these or any other treat / food made in china until quality control is much improved . . . thanx . . .

decafs and iced coffee's fyi . . . . this product came to me with 9 decaf cups and an iced coffee . i did not realize there would be decafs and if so wouldn't have purchased . that being said . . . the other coffees have been great so far and i'm happy to get a sampler before spending my money on a large box .

san francisco bay rain forest keurig coffee i found this coffee too bitter and strong . it was described as mild but i did not find it so . 
=================
vegetable beef soup - didn't like the flavor i am a huge fan of beer creek's chicken noodle soup . the soup is delicious and i buy it by the case . i decided to try the vegetable beef . bought a case and ended up not liking it at all . it just seems to have a horrible taste - no vegetable or beef flavor at all . so if you happen to try this one first , don't use it as an example . . . . . . it's just a matter of personal taste because the chicken noodle is a 10 - star soup ! ! 
=================
dry , dry , dry ( but at least it has strong cocoa flavor ) the eat . think . smile rich cocoa chewy granola bars sounded so promising as i like the taste of chocolate and cocoa . the cocoa taste did not disappoint , but the rest of the bar did . this is dry , dry , dry , and even more dry . perhaps these were intended for astronauts in space ? unlike their mixed berry eat . think . smile . chewy granola bars , mixed berry , 7 - ounce boxes ( pack of 6 ) granola bars that were saved by the fruit bits , there are no fruit bits in this one , so it is very dry . eating it with water or milk , or dipping or dunking can help a little bit , but still . i wouldn't throw it away but i wouldn't buy it either . if they fix the recipe , this has promise on the strength of the cocoa flavor . there are five individually wrapped bars in a nicely designed cocoa color themed box . each bar has 160 calories with 4 . 5g of fat ( 0 . 5g saturated , 0g trans ) , 0mg cholesterol , 60mg sodium , 26g carbs ( 3g dietary fiber , 7g sugars ) , 4g of protein , 10 % magnesium , 8 % iron , 4 % vitamin e , 2 % calcium . the back of the box states that one bar has more antioxidant power than a cup of green tea .

item is delicious ; price is ridiculous during my recent visit to new orleans in june of 2012 , i fell in love with etouffee' sauce on redfish . oh my goodness . delicious . i picked up a few packages of the louisiana cajun etouffee mix , for $ 2 . 00 per package , and made it at home . it was fantastic . i ordered the product on amazon from a particular seller and for the price of more than 7 dollars , was delivered one package . the product description on the website did not clarify the number of packages to be delivered for this amount . . . i assumed three packages for that price . i received one package and returned it to them immediately . you can purchase this product on line from the retailer for less than two dollars per package with free shipping . so , avoid purchasing this via this seller . great product however . 
=================
mostly chocolate i bought this because i tend to like chocolate coffees . that said , this one was a little too bland for me . 
=================
just sugar and salt . if you read the ingredients it says sugar and salt . so , you can buy sugar a salt and sprinkle it on your popcorn for cheaper . i can't believe i bought it ! 
=================
great product crummy price i started buying cib from this merchant in march because it is sometimes hard to find in the store . my first 2 orders were $ 15 . 90 for the 3 pack , my third order in june was $ 17 . 92 was $ 17 . 92 for the 3 pack which was cheaper than my local store . so when i went to reorder today i was shocked that it has gone up to over $ 23 for the 3 pack making it much more expensive than buying it at my local grocery store . so while i love cib amazon will no longer get my business for this great product .

compare price durkee cinnamon sticks , 9 - ounce containers ( pack of 2i have purchased frontier cinnamon with the other supplier durkee cinnamon because cinnamon helps in my neurological problem ms , so i wanted to compare and find out best valu for my money , i found out that frontier cinnamon is as good as durkee ( unless durkee explain me the diffreance ) frontier cost me almost half the price of durkee , and more over durkee's is not returnable as per amazon policy . 
=================
got my hopes up for nothing i am in the process of switching over to a meat free diet . i love tom gum soup and i have been making it , with out fish sauce . it's delicious , but i heard that there is actually a vegetarian version of fish sauce that i could use . so i researched and found this . i ordered it immediately , when i recieved it i was dismayed to find that it contained msg . a big no , no , for me . i never tried it so i don't know if it tastes good or bad . seeing msg listed as an ingredient was enough for me . 
=================
not so great the primary problem with this food is it's high concentration of corn - - cats are meat eaters and ideally most of their food should be meat . this food substitutes corn as a filler . over half of this product is most likely corn filler . this is pretty standard for cat food at this price level . they also use the less preferred method of safety testing their product . the best thing is to do actual feed tests where in a laboratory they feed cats the food and see if it's nutritionally adequate or if it kills them . instead this product is chemically analyzed in a laboratory and certified " safe " that way . this testing is inadequate and results in death for many people's pets . no evaluation is made of whether the food is digestible or not , if it is contaminated with poisons , toxins , or heavy metals . chances are this food won't kill your cat , but since they stopped feed testing , there's no way to know if future batches are safe . the nicest things i can say : the high filler means it firms up runny stools moderately well . it's somewhat better nutritionally than most generic grocery store brands
=================
other flavors are good , but not barbeque ! i bought 3 different flavors as i'm gluten free and they seemed safe . the pb & j was the best although it's kind of expensive when you are getting mostly peanuts but tasted pretty darned good . the almonds w / cranberries is pretty good too ! the barbeque i didn't like at all , they taste strictly like chipotle , you cannot taste any ranch , or barbeque taste . 
=================
processed taste , almost all fat , too strong smoke taste in my personal opinion , this is basically an overly processed fatty salad dressing made from a soybean oil base . i love mexican food generally and salads , but was put off by the label showing such a high fat content ( 11 grams for just a couple tablespoons ) and also the chemical preservatives listed on the label that i cannot pronounce . i tasted a wee bit on my finger and was kind of shocked by that strong " natural smoke flavor " and the vinegary , salty and bitter taste on my tongue . i noticed a little chili heat , which i like . since i was making homemade tostadas with fresh chopped lettuce , tomatoes , cheese , onions , guacamole , pico , sour cream and beans on a corn tortilla , i thought this would be the perfect compliment . all i can say is that for me it is not worth the dietary failings of the product as i don't like the strong smoke taste , even once tossed with alot of fresh ingredients , and it is high in fat and preserved . i would much rather spice up my fresh guacamole with cayenne / chili and know that the fat i am getting is a more healthful type . i will not be buying this product . 
=================
consistently good quality flax meal i got the 4 - pack some time ago , and i've been adding the flax meal to different foods . the omega - 3 oil increase definitely is beneficial especially if you're vegetarian , or if you simply eat a lot . some good ways to incorporate this healthy stuff into your diet : - soup . don't cook it into the soup , or you'll break down the omega - 3's - apparently cooking destroys the benefit according to what i read about flaxseed oils . add it to the soup around when you add cheese or croutons - sauces and chutneys . indian cilantro or mint chutney can hold a lot of flaxseed meal without its taste being affected . likewise for hot sauces , salsas and so on . - waffles . the flaxseed meal becomes a kind of solid fat that enrichens the waffle . i add it to regular , chocolate , or oatmeal flour waffles . yes , the waffle maker may affect the flaxseed meal directly in contact with the hot plates , but the rest of the fsm is not exposed to as much heat . - as they suggest , breads of all kinds . - if you're grilling a cheese sandwich , might as well up the fiber content and get whatever omega - 3's as you can salvage . stick it in the cheese . - believe it or don't it incorporates into nachos and pizzas too . if that's all your kid eats , maybe a flaxseed meal infusion will help ( but do fix the food habits , fsm is not a fix - all ) don't : - try to eat it plain , i tried it , and it's about as disgusting as trying to drink vegetable oil , plus it has fiber - add it to stuff that is still cooking . no benefit , the fat changes to regular unhealthy omega - 6 with the high heat from contacting the pan surface - overdo adding fsm to stuff . i tried to push the envelope , and if you overdo it , the food tastes slick and even a bit soapy , kind of like it's gone bad . - add it to clear liquids or foods . sounds obvious , but once you feel a benefit ( it can take a week or so ) you can get carried away . the last thing you want is to be disgusted by it . 
=================
bad delivery i haven't tried the ice cream yet , but it was delivered today - all mushy and the ice was nearly melted , there were just a few small pieces of dry ice . . we were at home all day today but our doorbell didn't ring except for another delivery . the box sat on the hot porch . the fed ex office said that the delivery didn't require signature . i'm on a special diet and on social security disability and can't afford to pay this much for ice cream that is nearly ruined ! 
=================
dry , small and quality varies a lot i have had these from trader joes few yrs ago when they carried them . they were big juicy and yummy . navitas ones that got shipped ( had 2 bags ) were small , more bitter than sour and dry . i will be in search ofbetter ones . update : i got the same 8 ounce pack from whole foods . 10 times better . most are juicy , soft and consistent quality . fyi the lot # of whole foods ones is 2521 and one from amazon is 405 . that may explain the dried berries from amazonseller .

oatmeal and lamb lamb and rice formula was awesome , used it for years without any doggy digestive problems . the photo and description on amazon are wrong now though . amazon is currently shipping out the new oatmeal and lamb formula which my dog cannot eat because of digestive issues with oatmeal . 
=================
sugar sauce this sauce is fine for small children to dip chicken nuggets in . it's basically karo syrup with some soy sauce added . nothing personal mr . yoshida , but this is just another reason that americans are overweight . we love anything that's just too sweet . 
=================
remember how much you're going to have to pay to ship this to the uk ! the cow tales themselves are as delicious as i remember . when i bought them the price i was given seemed a little expensive but ok . i carefully checked the bill and duly paid for them only to discover i'd been charged another whopping £30 + p & p without any prior notification . all i can say is 'buyer beware ! 
=================
not much to say clearly , this sauce provides an alternative to traditional non - franchised sauces . it's a runny salad dressing that has some tang and a lot of calories . whereas adults will find the taste , color , and texture largely unappealing , children may like it based on their experiences with taco bell . this sauce is not " hot " by any measure and not even close to any real mexican sauces . i consider myself a fan of real mexican food having lived in san diego for 13 years . this sauce is garbage compared to what any small restaurant or even street vendor on the border can produce . as with any processed food , the nutritional value is horrible and i doubt i will use it again . in 2 tbsp , which is not a lot , you will consume 110 calories , 300mg sodium , and 11g of fat . who eats this stuff ? these nutritional facts do not seem apparent on the amazon product page . bottom line - if you your eating habits are garbage , this sauce fits right in . if you try and eat healthy , stay away . you will find very little return in terms of taste versus nutrition . 
=================
too expensive i love cerelac . this price is too much though . they sell these at korean stores for $ 4 , 99 - $ 5 . 99 . go to hmart grand mart
=================
not a rip off ! ! ! to the person who states that the price is a rip off . . . if you can read you would see that amazon offers a six pack and if you can also multiply you would also know that six times three is eighteen . . . i love the taste and the fact that there are whole grains , plus soy , so i dont have to use milk , also there is honey and cane juice included so there is no need to add sugar either . . . 
=================
dont buy coffee on amazon . two bags of dried beans later i have learned my lesson . costco has very nice fresh coffee beans and amazon does not . 
=================
too weak these pricey little air - tight pouches reveal a delightful scent when opened , but the flavors are too light . neither the tea nor the spices are sufficient to make an enjoyable cup . i have used more tea bags and less water , and finally got to a strength that is palatable , but there isn't enough juice in these things . and the flavor isn't that great . i am not a huge fan of flavored tea ; i drink a lot , but usually just straight black tea , . however , back in the olden days i used to drink constant comment , and i've enjoyed many cups of chai at my favorite indian restaurant . it is much better than this stuff . 
=================
bottle pictured is wrong ( my 5 star rating is based on mega death . haven't tried ultra death yet . ) the bottle in the picture says jersey death sauce , not ultra death . why isn't there a picture of the ultra death bottle ? it is true that blair makes the hottest death sauce out there . we have mega death but my husband only uses it occasionally . i won't touch that one . if i want to " feel alive " . . . i'll get another tattoo . : - di'm was looking here at amazon for the ultra death sauce but since the picture here is of jersey death sauce , i'm not sure which one i'd receive . amazon - please update the picture there to show blair's ultra death sauce ! 
=================
zoe olive oil we bought it through amazon . it's seems to be very strong , but to us it tastes rancid . it spoils pour salads . 
=================
not that good i don't understand why everyone says these are sooo good - they smell and taste like the bean flour - which is very hard to mask - and they are grainy - not at all like regular wheat flour . my husband won't eat them - and my kids complain when i make them - the only thing i like about them is that they are fluffy . 
=================
the kiwi slices are not sugary i have ordered this product many times . i have eaten many bags of these . the dried kiwis are not sugary . they do taste like kiwis . i don't know what the other reviewer is talking about . i am addicted to these and to the dried cantaloupe . 
=================
light light on flavor this product needs to taste more like coffee . it is very light on flavor and aroma . it needs to be robust enough to handle a decent shot of half and half . 
=================
fulfills the " health food " stereotype confessedly i rarely to never eat health food ( certainly not if it can be avoided ) , so the fruitation strawberry bar met every one of my stereotype expectations : awkward taste , terrible consistency , and wholly unfulfilling . light on strawberry and heavy on . . . dates , barley , and other unpallatables , this bar doesn't really deliver on its flavor promise . much worse though , it has the consistency of instant oatmeal that's been left out for 2 or 3 hours , then shaped into a bar - soggy and moist - ish , providing enough solid substance to chew against , but barely . i do give the bar props for the whole no - gluten , no - sugar thing , and again my view could be wildly skewed by my virgin innocence to health food stuffs . for me , trying the fruitation bar was a less - than - pleasant experience i shan't repeat . 
=================
lipton to go stix need to go somewhere else ! these are convenient to carry in your purse or pocket , but i expected them to taste more like green tea and less like fruit juice . i didn't care for them at all . 
=================
item is wonderful , don't buy here though i was looking to see if i can get a better deal than 2 . 79 a box that i pay at my local , regular , supermarket . i will check the hodgson mill website , thanks other reviewer : ) sorry amazon , usually i do very well here but not for this . 
=================
they lose a star for having so many types of sweeteners . . . we tried this recently . i have to say i was pleasantly surprised . first off , i am allergic to aspartame , so most of the great flavors of drink mixes out there arealready off my radar . after living in a place with nasty ol' well water for a few years , i developeda soda habit that i am trying to break . i've tried plain tea , don't care much for it , so looked fora decent flavored tea that i didn't have to boil water for ( partially disabled , and no stove , etcwhere i am most of the time ) . last time at the store , i saw these . the package is a little deceptive , so be aware ! that " five calories " is not even for one whole bottle of water - it is for half of a bottle of waterwith one packet mixed in ! i guess they didn't want to post double - digits of a whopping ten calories , but that's what it is for one packet . the sweeteners are three kinds - honey , sugar and sucralose . why they needed three , i do not know . it actually ends up being a little too sweet . i make it , them dilute it with more water thanit technically needs . not sure why lipton can't just make something all natural , or use stevia , which has no effect onblood glucose . they seem to be hesitant to use it for some reason , but i don't know why . they have noproblems loading up the other drinks with chemical sweeteners , but avoid stevia ! weird . . . i have had a lot of problems with my throat swelling up this week , but i have been sick . i am not sureif it is related to the illness , or because i've been drinking this tea almost exclusively for the lastfew days . aspartame makes my mouth , tongue and throat swell up , which is why i read every label now . not sure if the sucralose is doing anything or not - i would tend to think not , because my lips are notnumb nor is my tongue swollen . still , i'd avoid the sucralose if i could . the flavor is really sweet , but i like it . it is refreshing and tasty . again , a little too sweet for mypersonal tastes , so i " water " it down with lots of ice , and it makes it very good ! it's worth trying . this is the only flavor we've tried so far , but will definitely give the others a shotas well . if it helps me give up soda , then that's even better ! : ) update july 9 , 2012 : well , it has been incredibly hot here in the midwest , with a heat wave that broke all kinds of records . of course , i was drinking a lot of tea . these packets are 10 calories each ( that " 5 calories " on the box refers to halfof one packet ! ) , and i had either one or two packets each day for the last month , perhaps . we also tried the peach flavor now , and i don't care for it , but my husband and son like it better than this one . i had to come back and add to the review because of something kind of odd . now , i am hypoglycemic , so maybe that is part of it , but i have to mention it in case others have this problem . i got this tea originally to help me get away from my pepsi habit . the 24 - oz bottles of pepsi that i buy have 300 calories in the bottle . i make the tea kind of weak , so one packet actually makes closer to 32 ounces of liquid for me - i like the flavor better that way ( just personal preference ) , so by comparison , i am getting just 10 calories for 32 oz , vs the 300 in the 24 - oz pepsi . savings of about 97 % of the calories , which should be a good thing ! here's the kicker - i have been gaining weight since i changed over to the tea ! nothing else has changed . i didn't suddenlytake up eating endlessly , etc , and in fact , have eaten a little less during this heat wave . i put on almost five pounds in the last few weeks of changing over to this tea . now , from a caloric standpoint , it doesn't seem possible . however , i am one of those people who does much better on high - protein , low - carb . if you have a similar type of metabolism / body , then be aware of these little packets ! i think it might be the honey in them creating a non - stop ( because i sip tea all day long to keep cool ) assault on my blood sugars . i've noticed that i feel hungry more often as well too . i normally don't get all that hungry - just have a few hungry days once in a while . with this tea , it almost gives you the munchies . i haven't indulged , so it isn't from extra food . it has to be the tea . again , i have to say that i don't think that everyone will experience this effect , but wanted to bring it up . i think the combo of the three sugars lipton has chosen to use for reasons unknown are having a negative effect for me personally . i still like the tea , but have now been cutting it down even more , to see if i can lessen the effects of the sweeteners . i find it odd to think that i could cut out 590 calories a day ( i usually drank two of those 24 - oz pepsis ! yes , i was bad . . . ) and gain weight . it has to be the way all those sugars are interacting with my system . so , if you are one of those folks who do really well on a low - carb diet , be aware that this tea could cause you to lose progress , or even cause you to gain weight . i have also warned my husband , who tends towards higher blood glucose , to only drink it with meals , never alone like i do . just an important heads - up on what could have been the best thing to happen to tea in a long , long time . lipton - please try making something with stevia , which has no impact on blood glucose levels and has no calories . why put sucralose into your items , when stevia is so much better ? i don't get it - it can't be that much cheaper to use ! and i'd pay more for an item that used stevia . . . what a shame !

seriously ? ? i honestly don't get the popularity of this item . it is nothing more than b complex in liquid form . i guess it's something to take if you don't carry around a small bottle of b vitamins . maybe i drink too much coffee and that is why i can't appreciate the energy effects of a b complex , i think taurine and guarana are much better energy sources . whether you prefer b vits , caffeine , taurine or guarana , below are products that will give you what this product gives you ( or more ) at a much more reasonable price . b supplements : b - 100 complex 100 capssuper stress b complex 100 capsliquid b supplements : nature's bounty b - complex sublingual liquid 2 fl oz ( 59 ml ) world organic - liquid b complex , 16 fl oz liquidcaffeine , taurine & guarana : red bull energy drink , sugarfree , 8 . 4 ounce can ( pack of 24 ) diet rockstar energy drink - double strength energy drink 16oz , 24 packmonster lo - carb energy 16 - ounce . , 27 . 5 lbs cans ( pack of 24 ) now foods taurine pure powder , 8 - ouncesuper guarana 1200mg - 90 tabs , ( good n' natural ) personally , i think it's silly to cough up two dollars for one shot of this when you can have the same level of energy , through the same vitamins at a much cheaper price .

no crap fillers or junk ingredients and made in usa one jar is a 30 - 60 day supply for your dog . 60 days if your dog is 25lbs or less . the instructions give weight ranges from dogs under 10lbs to over 75lbs . it says for maximum benefit to double usage the first 4 - 6 weeks . for freshness after opening , keep in the refrigerator . no fillers , sugar , artificial colors , preservatives , sodium , wheat , corn or soy . this powder comes in a plastic jar that is halfway full - - not sure if it settled during shipping but it's always a disappointment to open something ( like potato chip bags ) and find it's not quite full . despite my initial impression , it seems that this is a really good product . it is made by the same company that makes the vitamins that i take myself . my dog didn't seem to interested in it - - he sniffed it and walked away and then came back later and ate his food . it says it's salmon flavor but it smells a little chocolate - y to me . i've used other treat type supplements and my dog gets really gassy . i'm hoping this is more gentle on his stomach . i'll update after we've used this product for a while . 
=================
no salt . vodka taste ? oh yeah . i tried a couple of spoonfuls with this by itself . the first few were like a shot of vodka . . . straight . yeah . . . baby ! all my boyfriend could think and say was " fish eggs " , and " yuck , not me " . where i come from , that just means all the more for me . i got the 4 - pk subscription . it is almost as if there is no salt at all , but the vodka may be strong for some . since i am the only one who has the taste for it in my home , one jar can last for 2 days . by the way . . . not for kids . 
=================
fantastic taste , unfortunate about the msg , though . . . i used to buy the big bags of these and eat them constantly , then i looked at the back of the bag and saw they used msg in the cheddar kind , but not in most of the others . i ate chex mix as a healthy alternative to chips and other junk food so them using something like this basically had me switch over to another snack . you can have your own opinions about msg , but i think it's lazy personally when they don't even have to use it but they do anyways . they did taste great , though . maybe if more people complain about them using msg they'll release a new formula without it . and no , i don't mean take mono sodium glutamate off the label and replace it with yeast extract , or autolyzed yeast extract when it's basically just a different name for msg . i'd buy them again if we got a no msg formula . 
=================
no better flavor however , it took amazon 7 days to even ship the product to arrive in another 7 days after that . i'll check with my local grocer to see if they can special order a case next time . it's been almost two weeks since i placed the order and it's still floating around the us postal system . the package is actually further away from me now then the point of origin ! ! !

unusual flavor with a pretty good boost ! i've tried a few of the energy drinks . some are pretty good , some are yuk ! some worked while a lot didn't . now this one , it works . it gave me a good kick in the backside to get me going and tasted pretty good too . it did have an unusual flavor that i can't really describe , other than to say it was something different and i liked it . i only had one can of it to try and its kinda hard to be more specific from just that . i've looked for it in the stores around here where i live in colorado but haven't found any yet . at $ 28 for a 12 pack , that's really high for me and way out of my price range . there's several energy drinks out on the market now and a lot of them are priced far below these . if they bring the price down then i'd think about buying some more to try out . over all , this one gave me a good lift to get me going . it did give me a small dose of the jitters and my hands a minor case of the shakes for a little while at first . or as some people would say , a slight case of the tremors . but that calmed down after a little while and i got a lot more done around here than i usually do . i suppose that jittery feeling and shaking hands , or tremors , would go away if you used this regularly and got used to it . i don't have any problem with recommending this no fear , super energy supplement . except for people that have high blood pressure . this could cause your blood pressure to go up from a little to a lot . so be sure to check it a few times when you first use this or any other stimulant .

wouldn't have believed it if i hadn't tried it myself ! i kept reading recommendations for valrhona cocoa powder and what a difference it makes in baking . frankly , i thought the recommenders were embellishing a bit . . . . until i tried it . i have only found it online and at gourmet food stores and since using it in baking recipes , i will never use any other cocoa powder . it is truly the difference between a good product and an outstanding one . i ran out of valrhona in the middle of making cupcakes for a wedding shower and rushed back to the gourmet shop for some more , they were out of it and sold me a " comparable dutch processed " cocoa . it was not even close to being a good substitute for the valrhona . i will not run out of it again . if you haven't tried it , do yourself a favor and get some !

poor quality i carefully read all the reviews on this item before ordering ! i must say , there are not that many real tea drinkers writing reviews for this particular item . sure , if you are a lipton dipper , this is a great tea . but if you know what a quality tea should offer , you would not have given this product more than 2 - stars . the aroma when first open the bag , is quiet decent , but when the tea is brewed , the flavor is a disaster . it is basically a lipton like flavor . the color , is also unlike a good quality earl - gray ! which it should have an amber color , that can be anywhere from light , to deep end of the spectrum , depending if the tea is a single body , or need to be mixed with another tea for potentiation of color . at last , the tea leaves are not uniformly sized , which basically means this tea is probably a mixture of low quality teas , just flavored as earl - gray ! coffee bean direct should consider offering a better tea , for a few more $ $ $ ! ! ! at least 2lb of tea would be worth brewing !

huge price increase ! this is great soup but not worth $ 2 . 77 a bowl . i bought 2 cases because the price was so good , walmart was the only place that i found it for less but amazon delivers to my door . i paid $ 18 . 00 per case of 12 on 12 / 10 / 11 , today when i went to reorder the price had jumped to $ 33 . 21 ! almost double in a little over a month . i won't be ordering at this price , it's back to driving to walmart or finding another soup for my lunch .

only the truth i had been looking for an all natural moisturizer for a while so i ordered this . first of all , it is very impractical . you take a piece out of the bucket and then try to melt it between your hands as you rub them together . it takes a while to get this to disintegrate . then your hands end up greasy feeling . back in the day , i use to use palmers cocoa butter lotion and loved the smell , so i thought i'd like this product . well , i personally didn't like the smell of this . it was kind of a heavy annoying smell ; to me anyway .

worthless and ineffective my wife tried cutter advanced over a period of 2 - - 3 weeks , and found it to be completely without any mosquito repellent qualities , despite slathering the spray on in hourly doses . today , i got deep woods off with 25 % deet , and that product worked well , no mosquitoes or other bugs even landed on her . i called our local agway and told them what they had sold uswas useless , the manager said ours was the first complaint he had heard . however it works for other people , it sure didn't work at all for us . deep woods off 25 % was very effective , and next year we'll try the avon lady's " skin so soft " which is supposed to be even more effective . maybe i'll mix up a combination of that avon , plus some deet 100 % and really get something worth putting on . .

hot cocoa blahs i just love my keurig and i've enjoyed tasting all of the different coffees in the sampler pack so when i ordered this hot cocoa i thought it would be as good as the coffee . i was wrong , dead wrong . this cocoa is terrible and tastes like sugary hot water . you honestly get no chocolate taste at all . i had such high hopes for this hot chocolate and all i have now is the hot cocoa blahs .

4 greasy slim jim minis per pack - dog loves 'em these were to be my guilty pleasure ; haven't had a slim jim in years . the " mechancally separated chicken " as the 2nd ingredient is a little bit unappetizing in light of the " pink slime " enlightenment . they also contain wheat and soy . these are much greasier than i remember , so my dog got to sample them . my fur - baby loves them and will get the rest of the minis for treats . 
=================
all flavored coffees are not the same i ordered these 50 ! k - cups of flavored coffee because i liked some of the other flavored coffees that arrived in my starter kit when i got my b60 . apparently , the brand does matter . i like a stronger coffee and these are quite mild towards weak and thats on the small cup setting . i recommend doing some taste testing before committing to a 50 pack !

bog standard green tea and extortionate price before i begin to review this product let me clarify one thing ; i love green tea and and have tasted many different teas of various types . this tea is little better than something you would buy from tetley or any other bog standard tea purveryor who spoil what should otherwise be a noble and fine beverage something to enjoy as you contemplate the wonder and miraculous nature of your own radiant god like presence : - ) this tea is exactly that - mediocre at best with questionable quantities of reishi the much lauded medicinal mushroom used as a unique selling point . and the price they ask for this tea further exacerbates matters - i dont know about you but if i pay on average $ 1 . 50 per tea bag providing one cup of tea which tastes like something you would get at aldi or lidl then need i say more ? buy something else until organo gold get their act together and stop ripping people off with their cheap tea and fancy packaging which probably costs more than the tea itself !

a s . . . . . . t h e . . . . . . s t o m a c h . . . . . . t u r n s . . . . . . . . . . . . baar cola syrup at least tastes good . i agree with my fellow reviewers who say it tastes good . it's exactly like coca - cola in flavour , except that it's not quite as sweet . ( and thus , doesn't even approach pepsi - cola in intensity of sweetness . ) no matter - - i just add a few packets of my own favourite artificial sweetener . . . . this syrup , however , lists " high fructose corn syrup and / or sucrose " as its first ingredient . sucrose is another word for sugar . . . . bad enough , but at least it's been used for thousands and thousands of years , and most people , throughout history , who have imbibed sucrose / sugar , have lead relatively normal , ( and normal - length ) , lives . but high fructose corn syrup , though also natural , is a somewhat modern invention . thus , the claim above the name , " cola syrup " , right in the middle of the front of the label , ( that this is an " old fashioned remedy " ) is patently false . ( h . f . corn syrup was first - - unsuccessfully - - produced in 1957 , and then sucessfully mass - produced and introduced into foods in 1975 . ) even if you are born in 2010 , anything that has been around in foods for only 35 years , ( since 1975 ) , can hardly be called " old - fashioned " ! also , the listing of two ingredients , ( " high - fructose corn syrup and / or sucrose " ) , as the possible number one , ( largest amount ) ingredient , is misleading , confusing , and ( almost ? ) a violation of the law which mandates ingredients in food be listed in descending order of their amounts . are these " and / or " ingredients listed alphabetically ? in order of how many bottles have hfcs , and how many have sucrose ? and how does one know , ( if one is not a celebrity and is possibly being given the bottle for advertisement purposes ) , if the bottle one has purchased have the hfcs or the sucrose ? it is also totally astonishing to me that , according to the bottle , this product's manufacturer , baar , is the official supplier of edgar cayce products ! the insignia of " cayce care " is , indeed , on this label ! and although the insignia is quite pretty , ( a gold - outlined , white , horizontal oval , with a pretty little maple - leaf between the words " cayce " and " care " ) , i simplycannot believe that those who presently run the " edgar cayce foundation " would ever condone the use of high - fructose corn syrupin any of their products ! ( edgar cayce himself probably neverheard of h . f . c . s , as he himself died in 1945 . of course , mr . cayce is justly famous for his predictions of the future , ( which he found whilst sleeping ) - - but i am quite certain , ( after reading up on h . f . c . s . , on wikipedia and elsewhere ) , that if mr . cayce ever did dream of h . f . c . s . , he probably put it in the " nightmare " classification , and tried to forget all about it as much , and as soon , as possible ! in his place , i know that's what i would have done ! ) to find high - fructose corn syrup in an edgar cayce product is totally beyond belief . for myself , i will continue to admire , and research the modest , but completely genuine and gifted genuis who was edgar cayce - - but i will get my cola syrup elsewhere ! and , where elsewhere ? from sodasteam soda mix ! slightly more expensive than this " baar " cola syrup , it gives one : 1 ) a much , much thicker syrup , but the same 16 ounce size 2 ) sweetening with splenda . many people are down on splenda , but it has been cited as the safest of the artificial sweeteners by david zinczenko , of the " eat this - - not that " series of books . too much of anything is not good , of course , ( i found that using too much splenda gave me , personally , elevated readings on my liver tests . . . . so i cut down ) - - but from all i've read , splenda is better than high - fructose corn syrup , by a couple of miles ! so , it's sodastream soda mix cola flavour for me . if i find a healthier alternative than that , i will switch , ( and hopefully be able to share my discoveries in an amazon review ) . but , as of now , i don't think i will buy baar cola syrup , ( old - fashioned remedy . . . . ? ? ? ? ? ) , thin , watery , and most probably laced with high - fructose corn syrup , ever again ! near the bottom of the front of the label , it proclaims that this cola syrup , " soothes stomach upset " . but knowing i know now , this effect is , for my stomach , very , very temporary , at best . h . f . c . s . - - " high - fake - customer - switcheroo " syrup , is not something that i recommmend . . . . for anyone !

it's not very " green " to have to throw out toxic broken bulbs . . . or buy replacements for them ! these bulbs do have a lovely , bright light that is much warmer and enjoyable than the traditional eco flourescent bulbs with their cold blue light . that's what i usually hated about the compact flourescents , so i was super excited about these bulbs . but with amazon's terrible packaging , plus earthmate's equally terrible packaging , i got * 3 * of 6 bulbs broken on arrival ! what a waste . i have a baby around and besides the inconvenience of a return , it's dangerous to have these shards pouring out of my package as soon as i open it . not to mention apparently these things are toxic once broken . so a big fat thumbs - down on this purchase , despite the beautiful light of the remaining three . i will be looking for another site to purchase them from , one where the packaging has a better reputation . on amazon's good side , though , is that the customer service was very helpful and i got a full refund with one phone call . yeah , ps - it's hard ( impossible ? ) to find anywhere to dispose of broken mercury - containing cfl bulbs . so i tried to contact earthmate to figure out what to do . guess what - no phone number on their website . not even an email address unless you want to be a wholesaler for them ! so a word to the wise . . . never trust a 7 - year warranty from a company that doesn't have a phone number ! ! i did some detective work and these lights are made by a parent company called litetronics ( not to be confused with the apparently reputable lightronics ) . their number is ( 800 ) 860 - 3392 if you would like to pursue a similar complaint .

perfect taste but texture was pretty bad i was really disappointed with this mix . while mixing it , the consistency was just right , and the taste was perfect , there was a hint of maple . i added a little vanilla and i was so excited about the taste . after i made them , my mom tried one before i did and she spat it out and told me it still wasn't cooked all the way in the center . . so i tried one and found the same issue . then the next batch , i left on until they were more golden brown and crispier , and they were still very dough - y in the center . it was like eating raw dough . the only thing i really liked was the flavor , with maple syrup it was wonderful , because i made myself eat them not wanting to waste money . i usually love king arthur gf flour - i think it's amazing . i use it to bake a lot of regular things and substitute it for regular flour , but this pancake mix was a real letdown . i hope others have more luck than i did .

not for adults ! this keurig is the b - 44 classic for those of you wondering . my wife's shop has a keurig in her shop and she loved it . she wanted to buy one and only went off visuals . ( it's black and had two cup sizes ) so to my happiness i found it on amazon . a taken aback was i after two weeks of backorder i finaly use at home . in the instructions it says this is keurig classic b44 . brews two cup sizes small and smaller . 7 . 25 oz and 5 . 25 oz respectively . so , it is great if you want to have tea with your imaginary friends and plastic barbie china ware . not so great if you need it for your morning cup of jose . heck fire , it will not even fill up a normal sized travel mug / coffee cup . i would recomend the keurig elite b40 for people wanting to have their coffee closer to american proportions . the b40 will brew 10 . 25 oz . this classic b44 is a waste of k cups ; i will not reccomend to anyone other than for tea conasewers . at least amazon steeped up to the plate and gave me a gift card refund so i can purchase the correct one . thanks amazon ! boo keurig classic ( thumbs down ) .

not as easy as the box reads first off , this is available at your local supermarket ( we bought it at walmart for $ 5 ) . we decided to give it a try today and was quite surprised that the boxes 4 easy steps isn't at all true . you get a sheet with the steps . they range from a 30 minute wait to let the dough rise to making the pretzels and being told to mix a packet of baking soda in hot water and having to dip pre - made pretzels in the solution which makes them super soft and the stretch immediately . after making them we both agreed that they tasted exactly like a pillsbury croissant that you can get in the tube and roll out for $ 2 . needless to say , we were very disappointed . we love our auntie anne's pretzels when we travel or go to our local mall but at home - this is not worth it . i will say , we had enough dough leftover for two medium sized thin crust pizzas which we froze for a future trial as a pizza dough . hopefully that works out well .

check on side effects before purchase the flavor of this tea was excellent . be sure to check the web for side effects and conditions that preclude the use of this tea . i had a bad reaction after drinking one cup and found out that not everyone should be drinking it . it took me a full day and night to recover . for some of us this tea is like taking a very strong medication .

no plum taste , just full of salt this is very cheaply created umeboshi and no true taste . it has uncured runny meat , just full of salt . obviously it was not sundry - typically at least for 7 days which will shrink the meat more compact and has to be cured for 6 month or more with each shiso - wrapped in ceramic barrel . that's the way it's done in true japanese umeboshi which bring out great sour flavor in the first bite as well as true health benefit of umeboshi and will not have the taste of salt . my family or many of people who really know how to make umeboshi in japan , will cure umeboshi for at least one year and some are up to seven years . you only eat the one from the prior year harvest not from the same year harvest . most of health benefit of umeboshi can only be true in well cured umeboshi of 6 month minimum , otherwise you get the symptom of uneasy , queasy stomach taste . normally children are advised not to have more than one umeboshi for this reason . hope eden people rework on how to make umeboshi properly .

it's cheap , and it's bad for your cat . i was raised in a house that always had at least one cat being fed meow mix . owning my own cat now , i've done some research on available food choices . meow mix is one of the cheapest - - and one of the worst . not quite like humans , cats will eat until they are nutritionally satisfied * or * full . the problem with cheap brand cat foods is that they use synthetic products , carbohydrate - based fillers , and processed meat by - products . cats are obligate carnivores . the first two ingredients on meow mix's list ( the ones used in most abundance in the product ) are corn . as a result , cats are getting fewer needed nutrients per serving , causing them to eat until they get full and to eat more over the course of the day . healthy food results in a healthier cat . weight control , shedding , disease development , and more are all influenced by a cat's food . the excessive use of carbohydrate - based fillers in cheap cat foods , as part of this reality , can lead to weight gain and a higher risk of diabetes . many cat owners use meow mix without experiencing some of these problems - - but very few will use it without noticing * any * of them . brands sold in quality pet stores start with iambs as the " baseline , " and even iambs isn't what i'd call good for your cat . many of my local shelters feed their cats iambs as the least expensive acceptable cat food . even better , companies such as orijen and evo make premium cat foods made with very little or no grain content , which are ingredients cats would not naturally eat . whatever you decide , check the ingredients list . make sure some kind of meat is listed as the primary ingredient with other meats as close to the top of the list as possible . also make sure those are actual meats . meats are better then meat meals , and meat meals are ok ( and usually unavoidable ) . meat by - products are what you want to watch out for . the reality is that your cat is not biologically designed to eat a diet consisting mostly of corn or grain . healthy cat food is more expensive , but your cat will eat less of it , helping to mitigate the cost a bit . i recommend premium cat foods for this reason . they're better for your cat in every conceivable way , and they won't break your bank . even if you are on a budget , consider the cost medical concerns due to obesity or diabetes could incur . if you are currently using this food , maybe it's time to switch .

smell of the year ! i've been using this deodorant for 2 years now . i am a person that shops by smell when buying deodorant , so other features don't matter much to me . i first got a small sample of this deodorant and brought it along on my vacation . i came back associating my vacation with the smell of this deodorant . it smells amazing and reading the other reviews here , i felt compelled to write my bit in agreement . when i put this deodorant on , i feel like it would last until the end of the day . i would never have to worry about re - application ( " 24 hour protection " ) . it gives you confidence and makes you feel good knowing that you smell great , not to mention that it is composed of 1 / 4 translucent moisturizer ( " smoother underarms in 5 days . go sleeveless ! " ) .

new smaller size but same price anyone notice that kashi golean just lost some weight ? new box size is 13 . 1oz rather than 14 . 1oz guess they figured 7 . 1 % decrease in size would be more economically - friendly than a 7 . 6 % price increase ( the math here is a bit tricky but this is the true increase in price ) . # 8 / 29 / 12 # price has returned back to old price .

good toast chips old london melba toast is good tasting if you like small pieces . it is packed loosely in the box and so far out of 6 boxes i've only found two slices not broken into pieces . nothing like paying high dollar for toasted bread that is basically small pieces when you open it up . they definitely need to work on their packaging .

what every consumer should know - not economical the taste of sodastream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands . this becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of diet coke or diet pepsi . yet that isn't the main problem with the sodastream offering . the truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for c02 refills - - sixteen times ( 16x ) too much . while the general idea of at - home carbonation is solid , consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for sodastream carbon dioxide refills . in fact , the prices charged are sixteen times ( 16x ) wholesale costs or many , many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay . in europe , frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant - sized co2 refills . in the us , we aren't so frugal . other than the outrageous costs for the co2 refills , there are other issues with the sodastream fountain jet . one is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight . additionally , the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products . below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of sodastream soda . this includes the cost of the consumables and the equipment costs . i have used very generous assumptions , including a low discount rate ( i . e . cost of money ) . transportation costs were not factored because 1 ) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2 ) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3 ) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store ( i walk 100 ft . for groceries and drive one mile for bb & b ) 4 ) the reverse logistics for the co2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer . one of the reasons bed bath & beyond , macy's and crate and barrel choose to carry sodastream is that they want the consumer to make more frequent trips to their establishments for consumables . instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months , customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months . that makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers . one could argue then that transportation costs could increase for the individual consumer . total costs = $ 1 . 73 per two liter - - more expensive than retail * concentrateflavor cost bottle of concentrate $ 4 . 99liters of product per container 12flavor / l $ 0 . 42 * carbonatorvolume of co2 130cost of co2 per refill ( 130 liters ) 29 . 99co2 cost per liter $ 0 . 23 * sodastream equipment costs - amortization per literequipment cost $ 89 . 00equipment life ( years ) 5discount rate ( cost of money ) 8 % liters per month 10 . 00monthly amortized cost $ 1 . 80cost of equipment per liter $ 0 . 18 * water cost with brita filtrationmunicipal water costs per liter in us $ 0 . 0004brita filter three pack ( 454 liters of water output ) $ 16 . 95brita cost per liter $ 0 . 0373water and filter costs per liter $ 0 . 0377 ( assumes you already own brita pitcher so no equipment costs , just incremental filtration ) * * * total costs per two liter = ( flavor + co2 + equipment + filtered water ) * 2sodastream total cost per two liter = $ 1 . 73without filtered water : sodastream total cost per two liter = $ 1 . 65 * * * * * what does co2 really cost ?

too much of a " not so good thing " i wish i had not ordered in bulk . the recipe ( for cornbread ) came out bitter - tasting , and the only " new " ingredient was the flour , so i assumed that was the cause . i'm not sure , and i hate to " blame " this product , but i am hesitant to use it again and i have so much of it ! it would be great if we could get " trial " sample or variety packs of some of these products !

yorkshire gold tea i came across this tea in the grocery store just a few days after reading all the great reviews here , so i had to buy a box . but now that i've tried it , i have to ask : are we drinking the same tea ? because this tea has no aroma and very little flavor , and i would rate it below lipton's , if you can believe it . my recommendation for a great black breakfast tea is numi's morning rise breakfast blend , available in some stores and also here on amazon .

don't do it . greenies addiction is very real . the treats are nutritious and any cat will go bonkers over them . the downside is that your cat may very well stop eating his regular food . my cat litterally begs for greenies and even wakes me up when i'm sleeping . when i don't give him any , he goes off and mopes until he decides to try again . this whole issue has caused a lot of tension in our relationship , and i've decided to just go cold turkey . i just cancelled a $ 60 order of the treats . i want back my cat that loves me . . . not the one who goes through the motions until i break down and give him treats . he no longer displays real affection . many , many people give their cats these treats , but do some searching online and you will see stories similar to mine . they don't call it " kitty crack " for nothing . best of luck .

deceiving , a pity , really . . . well , back to mama noodles we go . . . i had high hopes when my friend i was visiting in portland was using these for a quick long - day - at - work meal - between - meals . then i read the label . hydrolyzed soy protein . not only is soy already bad for your health beyond a quick - reached 10g a day " healthy moderation " level , but hydrolyzed soy ( hydrolyzed " vegetable protein " almost always being soy , too ) is full of msg . it's not alone - - autolyzed yeast , corn - sourced maltodextrin ( which is nearly all maltodextrin anymore ) , the list goes on , but in short they are all msg . . . only unlike europe , america does not require that special " enhancer " code for various food additives and we as a result have to constantly be stealthy ( thanks , monsanto ) . so that said , i did taste a bit of it , trusting his comment of no msg ( it makes my head and stomach both feel like a vice grip is being tightened on them ) . . . and as i am sensitized to the weird not - salt flavor of it , i stopped and asked politely to see the package . sure enough , glaring at me is msg . . . for taste , i'd give it 3 stars overall - - the msg taste isn't super - strong , but it is apparent enough to set off all my alarms nonetheless , so i couldn't enjoy it . for ethics , it's a miserly negative 10 stars . . .

why would i want to eat peanuts with milk ? as advertised , crunchy nut smells and tastes like peanuts - - something i don't find very appetizing when mixed with milk and ingested in the morning . i eat peanuts with beer at bars , not at breakfast . i'm guessing that the honey is supposed to cut the flavor of the peanuts , but it is hardly detectable . people will of course disagree with my thoughts on peanuts in the morning , but let's take a look at the side of the box . to keep the calories per serving at 100 ( without milk ) , kellogg's has shrunk the serving size to 3 / 4 of a cup . that means with milk , a bowl of crunchy nut is going to be 300 calories or slightly more . so if you go back for a second bowl , that's a pretty high caloric breakfast . further , the base ingredient is yellow corn meal , which doesn't have much nutritional value . while there are certainly much more unhealthy cereals out there , in this day and age i'd like to see a more healthy , lower caloric cereal .

very large berrys , just not as tasty as they look the berries were packaged very well . they looked just like the photos on the site when i pulled them out . the berries were so large , that my guests were cutting the berries in half so they could eat them . that is when i noticed that the chocolate coating started falling off the berries . the chocolate will also start falling off if the berries are left out on the table for to long . i glade i got them but i do not see myself buying them again .

larger bottle is diluted i ordered the 2oz bottle as opposed to the . 5oz bottles , and it was very diluted . a couple family members of mine use it and buy it in the smaller bottles . it's like each bottle has the same amount of sucralose and otherwise is just diluted with water . my favorite product is sweetzfree that can be bought at sweetzfree . com . it's consistently sweet ( almost too sweet , but you can dilute your own to your liking ) . it's more expensive but is still a better value because of the amount more sweet that it is . to quantify it : to equally sweeten something , you would need 8 drops out of the 2oz bottle of ezsweetz , 4 drops out of the . 5oz bottle of ezsweetz , and 2 out of any sweetzfree bottle ( and sweetzfree is not twice as expensive per ounce ; hence the better value ) . however , ezsweetz is leaps and bounds better , cheaper , and is actually calorie - free as opposed to splenda which is expensive , nasty ( starchy ) , and actually like 200something calories per cup ! that's why it gets 2 stars instead of 1 for inconsistency . hope this review is helpful !

very high maintenance this product cannot be cooked more than 1 package at a time , and even then you will need to watch and stir it lot ( be prepared for a workout ) . the consistency is like rice not pasta . so the water becomes milky and if you don't cook it correctly ( which is difficult if you really want it al dente ) , it can be very chewy . the taste does not lend itself to authenticity . i wish i had not bought it and am stuck with the other packages : (

unhealthy ingredients chicken by - products , wheat gluten , meat by - products . not for my dog . the problems with meat by - products are that they may include indigestible or poorly digested parts of the animal ( think hair , beaks , hooves , teeth , etc . ) and it may include outdated meats from markets . dogs can handle the outdated meat fine , but the problem is in the packaging . one report i read said that some styrofoam from meat trays gets inadvertently included with the meat at the dog food factory . it is then very finely ground with the meat , with unknown effects on your pet . finally , dogs don't digest wheat gluten ( a thickening agent ) . wheat gluten from china has , in the past , included highly toxic melamine . the source for ingredients isn't on iams pet food cans . sometimes you get far less than you pay for . dogfoodadviser rates canned iams at 2 out of 5 , " below average for canned dog food " at [ . . . ] . the price certainly is above average for canned dog food .

boy , should you read the disclaimer ! there's a very good reason for the disclaimer on this website . these pumpkin seeds are imported from china ( ! ) by a company called yankee traders . ignore the fact they're called " pepitas " which made me think they might be from mexico , if imported ( which wasn't mentioned , either ) . then there's the label which mentions that these seeds are processed in a facility that " also processes products containing peanuts , tree nuts , soy , fish , milk , egg , crustacean shellfish and wheat ingredients . " i'm not allergic to any of those , but nonetheless after consuming about a half cup of these as a snack in the afternooon and at bedtime , i woke up with a headache , upset digestive system and other unpleasantness . considering all the accusations regarding poisoned pet and for - human products that are chinese - grown , made or processed , which have been in the news over the last few years , i can't help but worry about these seeds . i guess that's what i get for not wearing my glasses to examine the label carefully before consuming a new product . so much for healthy snacking - - you shouldn't buy these if you do have allergies , or if you have concerns about chinese food - related imports .

good enough for a light snack this are skinny little chew sticks . since i have a big dog who's an aggressive chewer , they don't last very long , but she likes them . of course , this is a creature who will eat cat poop so she doesn't exactly have a discriminating palate .

hit and miss - mine was a miss it seems like whether or not this ( or any of the other crazy cups samplers ) are worth it depends on the day and who packs your orders . i wasn't one of the lucky ones - over half of what i received were a vanilla flavor . sure , i've got vanilla cappuccino , regular vanilla from three coffee manufacturers , vanilla iced - coffee , decaf vanilla . . . i assume they were out of the other flavors that day and substituted all vanilla . quite a disappointment since i was hoping to try a variety of flavors before deciding what to order .

tofu shirataki noodles i first heard about shirataki noodles years ago and decided i would try it . i went to fiesta and got these tofu shirataki noodle . shirataki are made from konjac yams and the added tofu gives it a harder texture . the noodles without tofu added is 0 calories . the one with tofu is 20 cal per 4 oz which is low in cal . i always rinse the noodles first . i never cook it longer than 3 minutes . the first time i ever made shirataki noodles i cooked it like regular pasta and it turned into a gel - - this was years ago . i learned that was the worst mistake to make and changed how i make these noodles . the next time i made it correctly and tried to eat it with pasta sauce . that didn't work for me , since the flavors did not merry and i was accustomed to the hard texture of pasta . the noodles are similar to the texture of vermicelli rice noodles . i personally prefer it in soups and not as a substitute for spaghetti . i would sometimes eat it with a sauce i make with soy sauce , shredded ginger , chili paste , and sprinkle green onions on top for looks . i have tried this rinsed without it being cooked and it has no flavor whatsoever . it isn't like ramen noodles which as a flavor without anything added . even though i still eat the tofu shirataki , i just got the one without tofu and it is very similar . the one without tofu is 0 cal which is a plus . update : i did some more research on shirataki noodles in order to expand my ideas with recipes . i found that the reason that my shirataki noodles may have turned into mush was because it expired . it seems shirataki noodles is still good for a year and even after it is still edible however it would turn to mush if cooked too long . these noodles also apparently shrink and become thinner , something it seems some people like . i went to the store that i used to get my tofu shirataki noodles , and looked at the for an expiration date . lo and behold , it was expired by over a year . i even saw some in the store expired by over 2 years . it seems that non expired shirataki noodles will become alot more chewy if cooked too long . my mom used it in stir fry , and i have also tried it baked which is also a great idea . i been lazy and not just use any boullion cube with the noodles and that works fine . . . i just let it sit in the seasoning for a few hours to take the flavor of the soup .

misses the mark i switched our 10 week old kitten from science diet kitten to wellness kitten because she had the runs from the 1st day we adopted her . the shelter first said she never had diarrhea , then admitted she got the runs when she was spayed 2 days before we picked her up . so we are dealing with the unknown . two stool tests were negative so we feel this might be food - related . this kitten was also being fed wet food with the kibble ( purina pro plan kitten ) i did some online research and decided to stop the dry food as it contained grains which is very bad for the runs . and i also stopped the wellness dry as it has grains . the diarrhea has lessened , but it's been 2 weeks now & i'm still stumped . i did add some dry baby rice cereal into her canned food , and also include a capsule of probiotics ( spread out over 4 daily meals ) . she had a more formed stool today , so maybe she's turning the corner . i also question wellness putting vegetables / fruits in this kitten food ! these are not foods cats would eat in the wild . is this just another company trying to make a buck off us by putting in things we know are good for human health ? that would be the ultimate con job . i truly don't think cats need to eat fruits & veggies , so wellness is fast going to the bottom of my feeding list of good foods for cats . in fact , almost all cat food companies put out junk food for our beloved forever friends ! i will continue to try to find something more appropriate for this kitten , and another kitten , adopted a week later , from a different litter ( and w / no digestive issues - she was / still is being fed petsmart brand authority wet & dry - the dry contains grains / corn , but i won't switch her as her digestion works great on it ) wellness came highly recommended to me , but my search for a grain - free / veggie / fruit - free / wheat - free kitten dry kibble continues . . . . so wellness kitten kibble is off my list . i will try their canned kitten formula but not easy to find thus far .

beery flavor 17oz i have to admit , personally this wasn't very good . i tend to gag ( very slightly though ) so don't get me wrong ! some people may not agree . for those who prefer taste , i would skip on this and go with the other flavors like chocolate . i don't know what it is . . i find it kinda bland . even when mixing it with other juices . i give this 4 out of 5 . minus one star cause of the bitter / dirt flavor or something i can't explain it . i would rather drink / buy the 15 , 000 orac or chocolate flavor .

too costly on amazon this is a really good oolong tea . i love the sweet flavors that are inherent in the leafs . it is good for at least 4 brews if not more . i just follow the instructions on the packaging and it comes out tasting great every time . i use just over a teaspoon of leaves because the leaves are not balled up like some teas , they are more loosely dried . i bought this directly from the company , and i did the math . on amazon 1 . 75 oz * 3 cans sells for $ 24 . 61 as of 9 / 6 / 11 . however , if you were to buy directly from rishi - tea . com you would actually save money per ounce . this is the link - [ . . . ] on amazon : 4 . 69 per oz and you get 5 . 25 oz . at rishi : 4 . 25 per oz and you get 1 / 4 lb . if you want even more of this wonderful tea , you can buy in bulk and get the tea for even cheaper ! the only reason to get this tea on amazon at the current price is if you have free prime shipping , want to share with 3 people , like the tin cans , or like to burn money .

my lab just ate the whole thing ! omg , i gave this to my 1 year old , 110 lab and he ran outside with it . i got distracted and when i went to check he had already eaten the entire thing . the only thing i could find were two horrible splinter pieces ! ! now i'm at this moment terrified ! ! ! i read the other reviews where some dogs have had to have surgery because of these . . . i'm hoping and praying my dog will be okay . it's only been a hour since it happened and now all we can do is wait and watch . i've given him some bread and he gets pumkin every night anyway . plus he had already eaten his dinner so i'm hoping his " full " tummy will help the bone to pass . needless to say my husband is mad at me for not showing it to him before i handed it out . but we've been going through some major life issues the last couple of weeks and i'm not thinking clearly as it is . i soooo wish i could turn back time and have never given it to him ! ! please stay away from this bone and please , if you are reading this and have any good thoughts to help while i wait , i'm open to them as i am worried sick ! ! ! i've already lost my 14 year old lab in sept and this one we got in oct and he his my angel ! ! ! i would die if anything happened to him ! ! !

what happened to the price ? ? ? the price was considerably better a while back at $ 19 . 44 . how can they figure the original price was $ 6 . 30 per bag , when the company who manufacture's this product sells it for $ 3 . 99 per bag plus shipping . for the price they are charging now , i can get it at my local healthfood store for much less . the product is excellent and have used it for many years , but amazon's price is not a deal anymore !

disappointing flavor . not what i expected at all . i love coffee people's annual k - cup of their " santa buzz " which isn't a flavored coffee , just a nice bold flavor tasty blend and a matter of fact to me their best flavored coffee . the problem is , it's only available from them around the holidays . so in desperate need to stock up on " santa buzz " after the holidays for a good price i contacted coffee people directly to ask if i can still buy this fabulous flavored coffee from them . sadly they advised to me that it was no longer available , which to me is a big mistake , this is my favorite k - cup blend ever ! so i asked them what would be the closest in flavor to the excellent " santa buzz " and was told that this " tree hugger " would be it . i thought by chance that maybe the rep was pretty much possibly telling me that it was , maybe " santa buzz " just with a year round friendly name . well i ordered ` tree hugger " from here cause it was a little bit cheaper and boy was i so disappointed by it's flavor . it is not at all bold and rather weak in flavor . this k - cup is lacking in almost everyway in the flavor i was expecting . " santa buzz " is rich , nicely balanced bold without being overly bold and goes down smooth and well just yummy . " tree hugger " taste like the bottom of a pot of weak coffee in comparison . " santa buzz " needs to become a year round blend , it is their best blend . 
=================
not as good as before the first few boxes of k - cups were excellent - - strong and rich . the last two boxes i've ordered were completely different - - not nearly as strong . even brewing on the smallest - cup setting doesn't yield a strong cup of coffee . what happened , timothy's ? ? ? i'm guessing timothy's has reduced the amount of coffee in the k - cup . or maybe i got a bad batch . too bad . . . now i have to find another k - cup for my coffee subscription . 
=================
great product - terrible price i can buy this at my grocery store for $ 6 a package . it makes the best chocolate cake - you'll never know it's gluten free . but this price is too high . 
=================
out of production ? i assume this product is no longer being made which is kind of sad . i enjoyed it when i was a kid ( about 70 years ago ) and enjoy it now on turkey , chicken and liver sausage sandwiches .

i should move to sardinia didn't really like sardines much till i found these . now i eat them all the time with salad and walnut oil dressing . hope they come back in stock soon .

great bread ! ! bad pricing are you joking about the price ? you can get this at fairway , wholefoods , and other health stores for under $ 5 bucks . so what's the deal with this exorbitant price . it's flat out ridiculous . iwouldn't purchase it here - no way .

disappointed in this first time honey purchase i thought i would try a different brand of honey from amazon . the package arrived in tact in the box with no outside honey drippings as i had read in previous reviews , so i thought the purchase made it fine . however , upon opening the package , i found that both cans of honey were placed in a single plastic bag placed inside the box with no cushioning wrap around them . this did not protect what was in the plastic bag . both cans crushed into each other in transit with one that popped open a leak in the top of the can , leaking half the contents out in the plastic bag inside the box . i was able to clean up both the cans , so i received a can and a half of usable honey for my purchase . overall , the honey is ok , packaging is not good , so i was very disappointed in this purchase . for the price of this honey , i would suggest for anyone looking for a daily honey to use trying the ambrosia honey from co . ambrosia honey from colorado is much better in taste , texture , price and packaging . 
=================
taste great , after effects horrible ! ! ! ! i tasted these and thought they were the just as good as the sugar ones , then , , , about an hour later i was running to a bathroom . my stomach started cramping and making all sorts of noises . i'll leave the rest out . i only want to say , try a sample before you buy a big bag of these . you may or may not have the digestive system to handle this . oh , by the way , i only ate about 10 bears . . . 
=================
good , not great . if you are like me and like your coffee " strong and black " you have to be careful as most coffees tend to become bitter when strong and black . melitta hazelnut creme brulee has a bit of a bite to it , but not as bad as most coffees . the coffee is pretty smooth , but the flavor is not as rich as i would like for it to be . this is an ultra fine grind so you won't use as much coffee . overall , this is not bad coffee , but i was hoping for something better .

good for a go around , but probably not the staple snack for charlie the lickety stick is truly a unique product . it's basically a rollerball bottle ( like some deodorants ) with different flavored syrups ( like chicken , beef , or bacon ) . i've never seen anything like it . the promo video says dogs love the taste and it's very low cal ( oddly , the video also warns of an epidemic of pet obesity , which while probably is true , i had never heard it described in such catastrophic and somber tones ) . the treat is on the high price end of what dog treats usaully cost , but the maker boasts each bottle contains over 500 licks . i've been trying to figure out if that's a good deal . normal - sized treat bags don't usually have 500 treats , but on the other hand , you would never just give your dog 1 lick off this thing . if your dog likes the lickety stick ( there are review testimonies here going both ways ) , then it's left up to you how long puppy gets to lick , so the touted cost - effectiveness could quickly evaporate ( there is no recommended serving size on the bottle ) . all in all , the lickety stick reminds me of a sugar free lollipop . they can have a decent flavor , but not everyone will like them ; they don't have calories , so they're " healthier ; " and because they're calorie free , they don't fill you up at all , which leaves me with a final thought . regular dog treats do at least have a substance factor ; they are a solid food . the lickety stick is a calorie free liquid , so the filling factor is missing . and so while charlie did enjoy the lickety stick , she probably won't be getting another one . she is already in great physical condition , eats an organic dog food regimented according to the bag - recommended diet , and is taking c9 vitamin supplements . basically , she gets enough health stuff is what i'm saying ; so when she does get a treat , i want her to enjoy it like the treat that it is . i'm not convinced the lickety stick does that . now , if you are trying to wean your pet off table food or lower their weight , this product could probably help you do that .

has anyone noticed the first two ingredients ? are glucose syrup and evaporated cane juice ? just because these ingredients are organic doesn't mean they're healthy . i worry that we are giving our kids the implied message that sugar is good . we already eat a ton of sugar , as a nation , and i don't have to mention what our obesity rates for kids are . why can't we get a wholesome alternative that doesn't have a ton of sugar in it ?

packing nightmare there was no bubble wrap around the bottles - they were just rolling around inside the large box . only a few air pillows were in there . - lucky they didn't break

skippy natural with honey is way too sweet ! my husband and i eat peanut butter by the spoonsful . we had been buying skippy natural creamy for several years and liked it very much . recently , when i bought it i noticed that it is now skippy natural creamy with honey . i like honey so i thought it would be the same wonderful peanut butter with honey instead of sugar . unfortunately , it is not . instead of replacing the sugar with honey , they have added more sugar in the form of honey . it now has 5 grams of sugars per serving instead of the 3 grams it did previously . and it tastes so sweet now that the sweetness masks the natural peanut flavor . if the old style is not still available at the same price then we will be switching to jif natural .

raisin bran . . uh . . where are the raisins ? i am still a fan of old school cold breakfast cereal , the kind that just needs milk . even as an adult i still love it . i have my favorites , mostly embedded from my childhood and new varieties that are newer to the market . i would say that kellogg's raisin bran would be considered a favorite from childhood . therefore when i saw this new spin on " raisin bran " i was quite interested . this " raisin bran " has the addition of almond slivers and dusted with cinnamon . well i cannot express my disappointment with this cereal . first and foremost the cinnamon , i am not sure i would use the term " dusted with cinnamon " rather " dumped with cinnamon " . this is all i tasted was cinnamon and it was very , very sugary . secondly the almond slivers were pretty much nonexistent , which is sad considering it is promoted on the box . thirdly this is " raisin " bran right ? where are the raisins ? did the two scoops that kellogg's has built their reputation on been reduced to two tablespoon scoops ? the taste itself isn't bad per se , if you love cinnamon . i would rather just have a bowl of normal " raisin bran " . kellogg's did a find job with their " raisin bran crunch " so i am not sure how they dropped the ball on this cereal . and not for nothing , but the box that the cereal comes in itself is very small . this seems to be the case for most companies nowadays smaller packaging , higher prices . but in the case of this cereal there is some major deception . the cereal is supposed to have almonds , raisins and cinnamon . well there are barely any almonds or raisins and tons of cinnamon . so it appears that kellogg's is getting away cheap with this product . simply by charging more , making smaller packaging and skimping on the almonds and raisins and bulking up on cinnamon and bran flakes . i would be really surprised if this product is still on the shelf in six months .

ok if you need gluten free , otherwise i would pass i bought a couple boxes of these ( creamy peanut butter ) when amazon had them on their gold box deals . i was looking for a protein bar to use after strength training workouts and thought i would give these a try after seeing some reviews . wow , i am surprised these get as high of reviews as they do . don't get me wrong , these bars have a place for those who need gluten - free or for those looking for a meal replacement and don't want to feel hungry , but if you are looking for a protein bar , there are much better choices out there that taste 20 times better . i'm guessing there are also better tasting bars out there for meal replacement , but i haven't been in search of that so don't know . these bars are somewhat waxy on the outside ( faux chocolate seems like ) , but i was willing to overlook this as a lot of protein bars on the market suffer from a similar fate . it didn't help that these had overheated at some point in amazon's hands and the outside was chalky but other than looks , this didn't matter so much . the inside of this bar , well . . . . . it just leaves a funky after taste ( distinctly whey protein ) . it wasn't different than the protein bars i had tried five years ago , but it's nowhere near some of the other protein bars on the market . i didn't find the bar disgusting although i've seen reviews on the internet where many people couldn't eat them . i could eat it without thinking it was horrible , but i found at times that i just keep eating and eating and the bar never disappeared . . . seemed a chore to keep eating . it is an extremely filling bar thus why i recommend possibly for meal replacement . since it has 230 calories , it was a little too much for me to eat as a post workout snack . i have found that i can buy pure protein bars that have the same amount of protein and range from 180 to 200 calories however they are slightly smaller bars ( 1 . 76oz ) . the taste of the pure protein peanut bars is the closest thing i've tasted to an actual candy bar without a lot of sugar ( they have 2g ) . i find it hard to believe people say the thinkthin creamy peanut butter bars are like a candy bar . . . . wow , i think perhaps people need to try some other bars for comparison because you don't really know what to expect until you've tried a few others . if you need gluten - free or are looking for a meal replacement , these are ok , but i think you can do better with other products . i'm looking forward to finishing up my last box of these so i can start eating my pure protein revolution chocolate peanut caramel bars and actual enjoy eating them and get less calories with the same amount of protein .

warning ! ! get ready , cause you can't just eat one ! ! ! ! crazy good ! ! ! i bought the 6 pack so i could share with mysister when i went to visit . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

save yourself some money save yourself $ 10 and make this at home . you can make your own syrup by combining two parts ( i . e . 2 cups ) table sugar to one part ( i . e . 1 cup ) fresh water and boiling in a pot on the stove for a couple minutes . this will keep in the fridge forever . if it crystallizes just reheat to dissolve . any higher sugar - to - water ratio will likely crystallize too easily , and less will dilute your drinks / recipes .

misleading website celtic sea salt itself is wonderful . we have used it for years . i was very , very unhappy that i clicked on purchasing a 5 # bag of salt as you can see for yourself . what i received was a half pound bag of salt . the company was willing to refund my money , but it would have cost me even more to return it than would have been refunded . i would never , ever trust this company again ! shopper beware !

pretty sure this has some sugar added despite the fact it claims to contain only coconut water and pulp , i am pretty sure this has some sugar added to it . it is way too sweet . . . unless these are some very special coconuts . i've never tasted coconut water this sweet straight from the coconut . i really hope i am wrong . . . but my gut tells me they've sweetened it to appeal to the american palate , and haven't mentioned it on the can so as to appeal to the diet conscious folk at the same time . to me , it is actually sickeningly sweet and i definitely wont be ordering again .

garlic garlic walnut acres pasta sauce i purchased a 25 . 5 oz . jar of this organic pasta sauce at my local whole foods market . . it contains organic ingredients . each 1 / 2 cup serving is 50 cal . , 280 mg sodium , 1 g fat , 10 g carbs , 1 g fiber , 6 g sugar , & 2 g protein . it has a garlic punch that is very pleasant , but it is low on real flavor . it contains chunks of tomatos and bits of garlic . this is not a thick sauce . it taste much like diet sauces , and it is made from mostly tomato puree ( water & tomato psaste ) . and that's what it tastes like - - water & paste . i give this sauce 1 / 5 for flavor , 2 / 5 for texture / thickness , 5 / 5 for organic integrity , & 5 / 5 for packaging . this sauce will require you to doctor it up to make it palatable .

molasses treats not a hit i wanted to give these cookies a five , but my dog just wasn't fond of them . they look appealing and have a good fragrance . these also aren't crumbly like some cookie treats . i took a nibble and think they're quite tasty . but , just didn't hit the mark with my shih tzu for some reason .

the best grain free dog food orijen makes by far the best dog food you can buy . it's expensive but well worth it , especially when you take into account how much you will save on vet bills and the great boost it will give to your dogs overall health and well being . . it is grain free which is very important as grain is not part of a dog's normal diet and besides mostly being filler , grains can cause allergies and other issues . my 5 year old german shepherd is on orijen adult and has done incredibly well on it , stunning coat , great energy , consistently firm , and virtually odor - free , poops . i also have a large male golden who is now 13 1 / 2 years old and doing fantastic . he at orijen senior until about 3 years ago when we switched him to orijen senior . other than a little arthritis in his hips and knees ( to be expected ) he is perfectly healthy and his last blood panel came back incredibly good . my vet says we are doing all the right things ( daily walks and exercise , filtered water , orijen senior food ) especially since large goldens typically only live to 10 or 11 . when we are out walking quite often we meet much younger goldens ( 6 to 8 years ) that look much older than he does . it really does show what a difference diet and exercise make both in humans and in our canine companions . we have a new puppy ( that we adopted from the best friends animal society ) and she is on a mix of orijen puppy and doing great . highly recommend orijen adult , senior and puppy . note : many years ago we fed our dogs canidae because it was decent quality and we were financial limited . but , when the canidae manufacturer suddenly changed their formula ( added more grain and fillers ) all of our dogs had bad reactions ( diarrhea , vomiting , scratching , skin allergies etc ) . numerous trips to the vet and lots of dollars for tests only to find out they were all having a reaction to the poor quality ingredients in their food . that was when i began researching dog food ingredients and decided to go grain - free with a company that only makes dog food . could not be happier with my decision to spend more on orijen . very wise decision on my part , and my dogs are much healthy now than they have ever been .

powdery taste to these chips ~ but my dog likes them ! i love hummus and garlic so i thought these chips would be just right for me . however , i did not like them because they taste like they are made with powder ingredients . the reason for that is that they are actually made with : " garbanzo flour , garlic powder , onion powder , soy flour , potato starch & corn starch " . hence the reason for the powdery taste . yuck ! but the good thing is that my dog likes them , but then she likes everything .

if you really like graham crackers . . . ? newtons fruit thins ( cranberry and citrus ) / b004fej968i was really excited about receiving these cookies through amazon vine - i'm a big fan of the newtons " fig newtons " line of products and always have been . it seemed like a transition to " cookie " would be inevitably good , but . . . these cookies just didn't do it for me or my family . i guess i should have been concerned when my husband bit into one of these and said , " these taste like sand ! " i didn't feel like they were quite * that * bad , but it's true that these are * very * dry and somewhat crumbly . they remind me a little bit of dry graham crackers or dry " nilla wafers " - i ended up dunking these cookies in milk to make them a little more palatable . the dried fruit bits in these cookies are nice , but not anything to really write home about . the cranberry and orange flavoring is very subtle and seems to come across more in the scent than in the actual taste . overall , i like the sweetness balance of these cookies - they're not overpowering , and the flavor is nice - but the intense dryness of the cookie combined with the sticky chewiness of the dried fruit was just too toothsome for me . if the cookie had been softer , i would have liked these a lot more - as it was , i felt like i was eating very dry crackers and i didn't enjoy the experience . i don't like to waste things , so i'll try to finish the entire bag , but the rest of the family has already informed me that i'm on my own . note : this review is based on a free review copy of this product provided through amazon vine . ~ ana mardoll

excellent product . . . until amazon ships it ! i want to start by saying that if i was reviewing the food alone , it would get 5 stars easily . it's a quality product and my picky eater cat ( as in , he would literally rather go hungry for days on end than be coaxed into eating something he doesn't like ) loves it . having said that , i won't buy this ( or any other canned product for that matter ) from amazon . com anymore , unless they were to significantly change their packaging method . normally i only review a product all on its own because other factors are incidental , but this time it seemed fitting to comment on shipping too because it drastically affected the overall quality of the product and is an unavoidable part of getting it to any customer . the product arrives in a small cardboard flat with 2 layers of 12 cans each , then the whole thing is shrink - wrapped in plastic . then they put it in a shipping box and put 3 air pillows on top . exactly 1 / 2 of the cans arrived dented ( the entire bottom tier of the flat ) , many of them so badly that it looked like they had been run over by a car . amazon . com customer service is great and responsive - they shipped the replacement out with complimentary next - day shipping . . . and it arrived in exactly the same condition . in the end , i got everything i paid for , but 1 . do i want to go through this every time i order it ? no . and 2 . it's hugely wasteful because of course the dented cans are unusable because the seal could be compromised , offering the perfect breeding ground for botulism . i can fairly say that this is typcial for canned products in general from amazon , too . i've gotten black beans , kidney beans , chick peas , tomato sauce , and tomato paste from them , and there wasn't one order among them that didn't have the same problem . again , customer service was great and sent quick replacements ( again with a high damage rate ) , but it's not worth the hassle and waste . if it ever occurs to them to pad the entire order and not just the top of it , i'll return to using them because the free shipping and convenience of subscription auto - order ( and subsequent additional savings ) really are nice .

take your dog out to dinner . its cheaper and lasts longer . i see many of the reviews of this product were for puppies . maybe they aer good for puppies , but not for dogs ! ! i purchased 6 quado dog bones . the dogs loved them and devoured them in only an hour . i was disappointed and disturbed that they went so quickly and went back to read the packaging to find a small blurb on the back of the package on the bottom right " quado is to be consumed over a period of time and not in once sitting or even on day . " ( 1 ) i paid about $ 8 for each bone with shipping . this was for a bone which lasted only an hour . i expected it to be a " bone " not a " treat . " i could have taken my dogs out to dinner for that price . ( 2 ) if the bone is meant to be consumed over time , please make that obvious on the front of the package and not in some small print on the back . it worries me now why they printed the statement on the back . i can appreciate the fact that they created environmentally - friendly products and trusted that i would be satisfied with my purchase . i buy the best for my dogs despite not being a wealthy person . i bought these bones because the shape is a great design . i expected a bone that would last . i am disappointed . i would requested a refund for my purchase price . i have yet to hear from the company n - bone .

almost a $ 17 hike in price ? i love this coffee and bought my 3 pack about 2 weeks ago for $ 18 dollars ( as i have for quite some time ) . now it is $ 35 ? what's up ? i am now on the hunt for cheaper - - and can understand a price hike but this is too much at once .

i love this stuff , but this last one i got what a mess . it arrived in the 'ready for shipping box' only the outside of the box was damp in places and the inside was very soaked from the leakage of the creamers . i have had to throw many away and some are not easy to see why they are leaking . for some reason the seal tops are on but not adequately and i go put into my coffee or tea and i get a clump of mucous like substance instead of creamer in my drink . . . another waste . . . that is not going to pass my lips . i love the creamers , love the subscription program as i change flavors and mix and match . . . plus i don't have a refrigerator so please do note this review is for this one delivery only , all other times i have been happy , but they all came double boxed and in good condition and most enjoyable . amazon has never let me down before on my creamer purchases this time just a mishap . . .

if you are a coffee hound go for the dark roast version i love my illy , but after drinking the dark roast version and trying the medium roast i felt like it was a downgrade . keep in mind that i like my coffee strong and the medium roast i could not bear to drink it black . i went back to the dark roast immediately but for the casual coffee drinker you might like it .

were these reviews written by dale's corporate ? short and sweet : my girlfriend sent me a bottle for christmas . she lives in alabama . i live in maine . i'm not a 'health nut' and i love good steak sauce . this is not it ! the stuff tastes like kikoman on steroids . it is so salty that i couldn't deal with it . the bottle says an avg serving has 1200 mg of salt ( sodium ) . that is more than half the daily allowance for someone with no heart problems , cholesterol , yadda yadda . this stuff is heart attack in a bottle ! it also has a bunch of msg . i am not concerned because i think the msg scare is a bunch of hoopla from the moonbat lefties crowd . if you're a moonbat type , be advised . my main complaint was the flavor . as i said it tastes just like soy sauce . not my first choice to flavor a good steak . i would strongly recommend a1 steak sauce or worcestershire sauce over this stuff any day . also , mccormick has some excellent marinades that come dry in an envelope . just add oil . sorry to dump on this stuff , but i am being as honest and objective as i can here .

very disappointed my case of wolf chili arrived yesterday . lets start with that . hey amazon , whoever works in your shipping department should be fired . this case of chili was in a box about 8 inches larger than the case itself , no problem there . but only 1 piece of brown packing paper was used , and it was placed on top of the chili . there was no packing around the sides of the case , so this chili was sliding around in this box and tearing the box up . a few of the cans were dented , but no problem there . i worked in shipping and receiving before , and if anything was packed in this manner , it would be totally unacceptable . i am surprised ups even accepted the package the way the case was sliding around in the box . ok , enough of that . on to the chili itself . i bought this because i had read so many reviews about how wolf chili is supposed to be the best . well , i gotta say that it doesnt even come close to the best . first of all , open the can and pour it into the pot . thats right , pour . the consistency of this chili is almost like soup . any other can of chili you would either have to shake vigorously out of the can or spoon it out , but this stuff just pours out . and i think there was beef in it , but it must have been ground up so small that it was hardly noticable , again , adding to that watery consistency . as for the taste , well , it aint bad , but again , nowhere near the best . but the consistency of the chili and the taste combined ? makes you wonder how anyone can rave about this stuff . 4 / 10 at best , and thats being kind . if you want the best , i would go with stagg . many different flavors and a much higher quality , and better consistency .

poison poison " chlorhexidine " poisonwe have two beautiful saint bernards . after using these for some time , it began to be a routine that they would both have to go outside to vomit after their supposed morning treat and dental care . we investigated this chemical that the package warns you about , " chlorhexidine " and stopped using the ignorantly designed dog hating treat . no more sick dogs . if anyone likes their dog at all , they will read the package . notice first the ingredient , " chlorhexidine " then the warnings . there's good vets who don't sell these , and bad vets who like the profits . of course , pharma and all their " vet / doctor " salesmen will say this product has been tested , used for years , found to be safe in thus and thus quantities , and on and on . well , the chemical chlorhexidine is used to kill bacteria . good and bad ! it's used pre - surgically , washing the body and prescription only mouthwashes . your dog , like all living beings has a body especially a digestive tract , full of very much needed bacterium . the company knows this , and to protect themselves even warns that " serious " problems may occur , especially if your dog " licks " the surface first ? wow , and how is a dog supposed to not lick a dog chew he's sucking on for hours and yet consume it ? do some research on what this stuff will do to your dog people . unless your trying to euthanize your dog with a long , painful , and ; " conveniently - racking up a massive vet bill to diagnose " and non treatable death sentence , stop feeding them this poison . and yes , they are the same " intellectual scientists " who've managed to put half our nation on " safe for you " psychotropic drugs . ironically , " prolonged use of this poison will cause tooth discoloration , " leading to possible other side effects of tooth decay . " japan stopped using " chlorhexidine " on catheters and other medical devices in 97' after many became sick and one died . causes numerous ( still discovering more ) problems with cats . deafness , respiratory problems , in 96 in mitchell south dakota they discovered it was the cause of a plethora of severe issues with cats and had to stop using it . the believe it was from the cats " grooming " it off their coats after surgery . too many problems to report here , do your dog a favor and do your own . and don't look get your information from the doggy sites . look up the problems with the chemical . is it like declawing your animal ? " and they tell you it doesn't hurt them when they rip the dew claws out at the puppy age ? " yeah , i'd like to declaw a few vets ( pharma salesmen ) and have them give me a report ? most importantly , you do not want to kill any bacteria in your dogs system . period , that's why they've generally for so long , been so healthy , let's not screw that up as we have our own body's with infections causing irritable bowel diseases etc .

broken shells i ordered a case of these and found that there were like 3 broken shells in many of the packages . there was no damage to the shipping box however , so i assumed that they are pretty fragile . get this : i emailed amazon about the problem and they said they don't take returns on groceries , but would send me another case for free ( overnight ! ) and that i could go ahead and keep the one i had . amazing

sometimes you feel like a nut . . . i am a big fan of the planter's nut bar , except when i was a kid they were big and lasted a long time . now they've shrunk ( but i haven't ) . so when i bit into the nut and grain variety i was startled . it was almost like my favorite nutty bar , but there was something strangely healthy about it , which went against my sense of delectable unhealthy eating . if i wanted helth , i would have bought a saw dust granola bar . not . i guess if your doctor prescribes saw dust bars and you want a little peanutty flavor to them , and chew instead of the delightful crackle , get this one . it left me indifferent to health and yearning for the parent product . sometimes the old family formula is best left alone .

paper bag instead of plastic previously when i had ordered this rice it came in a fully sealed plastic bag . i loved the rice and that is why i ordered more . . . . . but . . . without any change to the advertised description , the rice came in a paper bag . the paper bag was not made water / air proof in any way , even for shipping . obviously this does not seem sanitary at all and i will not be eating it . i have received a refund . amazon has not acknowledged that the photo for this product does not represent the actual product being sent , nor the potential health risk . i will still buy from lotus foods , but will be more careful to buy in smaller quantities less likely to be switched to inappropriate packaging . i will not mark down this organic item from 5 star , but others whom are concerned about the potential for contamination from packaging not airtight should be cautious .

nice for an occassional treat this is my first time trying any of the national foods coffees . first of all , be careful when you open the package . i peeled back the cover and powdery coffee went everywhere . making the coffee is very easy - just put a few teaspoons ( they recommend four ) into a mug with hot water . i really loved the smell of this coffee . the pumpkin scent is great , and really makes you think of fall . my problem was that it was really too rich to drink more than a couple sips . the coffee seemed very sweet , and didn't match the smell , meaning that the actual coffee didn't have that " bite " of pumpkin . i didn't find it very satisfying . however , a couple family members said it " wasn't too bad " and did manage to drink the whole thing . so i think a lot depends on your taste . overall , it is a rich coffee that is best used for an occasional treat rather than as your regular morning beverage .

product details are wrong the description is for " crackheads " candy , but this is " crackheads 2 " which has more caffeine . crackheads have 200mg of caffeine , crackheads 2 have 600mg .

additives shouldn't be here my husband accidently bought me the wrong kind , " sweetleaf " is the best . this columbian brand has maltodextrin , and there is no place for it , other than used as a filler when they want to go cheap on the primary herb . don't like this one , don't know what to do with all these . good grief . 
=================
i'm waiting for results increase in vitality , energy , stamina etc . were promised but to date , after taking the product for a month as directed , i haven't seen any change in my general health or fitness . either " salba super grain " is a total hoax or i'm just so healthy that i couldn't get any better ! i would not recommend the product to anyone except maybe cheyney and his silly sidekick . 
=================
great if you love to eat insects they use carmine ( cochineal ) to color this . in other words , crushed insects . i'd rather have it not such a vibrant color and insect - free . this product is not kosher or vegetarian . 
=================
tried once , switched brands . now happy . they sell these things at trader joe's , which is where i got mine originally . these are decent , if you don't already know about " mama lupe's " low carb tortillas . at only 3 carbs per tortilla , and with the closest consistency and taste of a tortilla you won't find anywhere else - other than in a regular flour tortilla - " la tortilla's " get their behinds handed to them by that brand . unfortunately ( because i love me some amazon so much ) , you'll have to buy them at netrition , where you'll have to pay a flat shipping fee of four dollars and ninety - five cents . in other words , it becomes very well worth it if you end up stocking up on them ; which you will . like this brand , you have to keep mama lupe's refrigerated or frozen . note to amazon : it breaks my heart when i have to purchase something that can only be bought online , from another website . bring mama lupe's to amazon , and show the people what a real low carb tortilla taste like . do it for us . do it for . . . america .

great concept - but low quality - will jam permanently i wish another company would make the same product with better quality . although the concept is spot on , there's a problem with the rubber o - ring inside the pump - it will slide out of place and jam up the pump so that it becomes unusable . my first one lasted about 9 months before that happened , so i was willing to try again . the second one , however , lasted less than a month before the o - ring slipped and the pump jammed . there is no way to open it up to fix it . so until they fix this problem , this product is hit or miss . caveat emptor ! 
=================
vitamins have a taste ok , i consume a lot of splenda every day . i eat some in my morning oatmeal , and i always make it a point to get the diet coke with splenda in it , rather than the aspartame stuff . i have been getting the fiber splenda . one gram of fiber per packet didn't seem to be much , but it was something to make the sweetener less empty , and it eliminated the gram of dextrose used to stretch the splenda to make it measure . you occasionally see the tablets of splenda , but they are rare , and they don't work on oatmeal . so i asked my wife , " please surprise me by switching to the splenda essentials with antioxidants some morning over the next week . " she agreed . on the third morning , i noted an odd taste in my cereal . not unpleasant , just odd . i asked her , and she confirmed , that was the first morning she had used the antioxidant splenda . so , unlike the fiber splenda , the antioxidant splenda has a taste . now , i normally only put sweetener in my coffee if it is nasty tasting . but i don't have any nasty tasting coffee , so i put the antioxidant splenda sweetener into regular coffee just to see if i can taste it . i am pretty sure i can taste it , but it is not a blind taste test . i am going by what i taste in my oatmeal . as i've said , the taste is minor and not unpleasant . it is hard to detect when i put one packet into 8 ounces of coffee . my opinion is that splenda is the best artificial sweetener on the market . the worst tasting is aspartame , then stevia because of the odd licorice overtone . then saccharine , and that only when a small amount of saccarine is used . i used to make ice tea with a half gallon of strong tea and one saccharine , and at that ratio , it was not bad . it took the bitter edge off of the tea . if you can get cyclamates , they go here , and then , at the top , splenda . nothing tastes like sugar , especially not corn syrup , but splenda has the most neutral sweet taste of the artificials . now that it is available , i try not to use any of the other artificials , and i am not supposed to consume a lot of sugar . so plain splenda would get five stars as an artificial sweetener . essentials with fiber would get the same score . antioxidant gets 4 stars because it has an off taste that is not a bad taste and because it is detectable other than sweetener . i believe that even with this off taste it tastes better than saccharine . so it loses one star for the detectable taste , but not more . this sweetener comes in a heavy , stiff , hard to tear bag , that could probably survive being kept in a wallet in the rain without damage , and the bag is stiff and strong enough that someone with bad arthritis might not want or be able to use the sweetener in the bag . 
=================
nice scent , gritty texture i'll start off by saying that i don't care that these are kosher . i bought them because i could get marshmallows in bulk for a gift idea . that said , i'll start with the good . these marshmallows are longer and skinnier than store - bought . they have a very pleasant vanilla scent to them as well . holding them , they are nice and squishable and if you need to rip them into bits , they're not as gooey - sticky as store bought . as for the bad , i tried these out plain and in hot cocoa . raw , they taste and feel like puffy sugar . when half melted in my drink , the sugar crystals really took over and i felt like i was eating sugary grit . kids might like this , but if you're expecting a soft , light marshmallow fluff sensation in your drink , either make your own or stick with store - bought . because of this , i probably would not buy these again and i most likely will not use these for my gifts . extra information : yes , these marshmallows state they are pork free , but to get the gelatin they needed , fish products were used instead .

great chips , but i prefer the bag with the blue chips included take them to your grocer and exchange these for the bag that also has the blue chips with the other chips . 
=================
it's just hormels chili i loved stagg chili but they all of them seem to have disappeared except this one . the chili is ok but it seems like someone took the average hormel chili with ground beef and beans , tossed in three to four chunks of tender meat ( quarter to half inch cubes ) , and tried to pass it off as something special . i would like to say next time i would just buy hormel chili and save a lot of money instead of this but i won't even do that , hormel chili was not what i was looking for . 
=================
the ad i know that the product is good but your ad says " 30sachets at 20grams each equals 300 grams " . well , 30 times 20 equals 600 not 300 . so what do you get for the advertised price , 600 grams or only half as much ? i asked this question two times last week , once by email and once by phone , yet i still have not received a response and i see no correction on the website . i want to buy , i just need to know what i am getting .

time saver : morning coffee & mouthwash all in one anyone who has enjoyed dipping a candy cane into a mug of cocoa and savoring that hint of minty goodness that blends so perfectly with chocolate is going to be really , really disappointed by this brew . the harsh artificial peppermint flavor tastes exactly like mouthwash . the coffee flavor is very faint , there isn't much sweetness either . this is a perfectly horrible beverage . i tried adding a little sugar , hoping more sweetness would cut the medicinal peppermint assault . it didn't . forget tv commercials that depict women sighing with delight over their steaming mugs of international coffee . if those women can drink this stuff without shuddering , it can only mean one thing : they had the foresight to lace it with a double shot of bourbon . if coffee / chocolate / mint appeals to you , there's a really easy way satisfy the craving : make a cup of real coffee and toss in a peppermint patty . no kidding . it's easy and yummy . you get a lovely , rich , chocolaty , minty blend ( and you can still add that shot of bourbon if no one is looking ) . and when you finish the cup , there's this delicious chocolate - mint sludge at the bottom of the cup waiting to be spooned up . 
=================
i really wanted to like this . . . i really wanted to like this flavor and drank the first 4 before giving up . the donut 'flavor' is chemical - ish and the chocolate is more of a smell than a taste . it's not completely undrinkable ( thus 2 stars , not 1 ) ; it just isn't good or enjoyable . i wanted to try the donut house cinnamon roll too , but am afraid of similar results . i am now looking for a k - cup buddy to trade with or give away the balance . i wish green mountain coffee ( makers of donut house ) offered small trial packs with 1 or 2 k - cups of various flavors . i bought the 24 pack online because i couldn't find it locally ; perhaps that should have been a hint ! as for recommendations , green mountain coffee's breakfast blend and decaf are great ! gmc's half - cafe is excellent , just right for after dinner ! 
=================
good price , good service , the coffee's not that great the more i drink this coffee the less i like it . unless you're mixing it with lots of sugar and milk , it's harsh and acidic ( in my opinion ) . but the price is great , isn't it ? i'm currently looking for alternatives . . . . .

contains bpa ! i love muir glen tomato products but sadly i had to give them up due to their can liners containing bisphenol a ( bpa ) . i will not feed anymore bpa to my kids ! it makes me sick that i fed them with bpa laden baby bottles before i knew better . we already have enough cancer in our family . i don't know why anyone is surprised that bpa acts like a synthetic estrogen therefore an endocrine disrupter - - bpa was originally developed in the 1930s as a synthetic estrogen drug for women . shortly after it was developed , a new synthetic estrogen drug came out ( des ) so bpa fell by the wayside until someone figured out it could be used in plastics and can liners to help make them harder . i wrote to muir glen ( now owned by general mills ) to see if they have any plans to remove bpa from their cans but they did not respond to me . i would be happy to pay a bit more for jarred tomato products if they can't come up with bpa free cans . or how about tomatoes in cartons or frozen ? please write to the companies that you buy canned tomatoes from and ask for bpa free products . let me know if anyone finds bpa free tomato products , such as tomato paste , diced tomatoes , whole tomatoes . . . by responding to this comment - - i will get an email . i have young children and i will not feed them anymore bpa ! ! !

no better than high quality cocoa in your hot water i really wanted to love this , but at the high price - - directions say 3 spoons per 8 oz water - - i like my ghirardelli cocoa in hot water . just as good , waaay cheaper . 
=================
a little disappointed they were very cute but thought they had a little tab to insert in cupcakes so had to lay them flat
=================
imposters ! they are different from the us version , they dont taste or feel quite right . still tasty though , just not the same .

pricey this product is available at 89c at whole with a 10 % case discount and you are charging over $ 1 . 30 . sometimes when it is on sale we het it at 75c

chocolate flavor overrides the coffee flavor i like this but it tastes more like chocolate milk than coffee . the coffee flavor is bland and weak considering this is supposed to be an " italian espresso - style coffee drink " as the can says . this tastes better ( not overly sweet ) than the starbucks drinks available at grocery stores and the can is lighter to carry along in my purse . very convenient . 
=================
dog knows best . . . there are surely some tasty morsels in chef michaels grilled sirloin dog food and there are a few things which my dog wants nothing to do with . my 11 year old dog is pretty set in what she likes and does not like . she is about as discerning as a dog can be . she might have some cat in her as far as her taste buds go because she can be very picky . my dog , luelue seems to pick some bits out and chow them down pretty fast and leaves alot lying all around her bowl . then she also does that dog thing where she leave a little trail . i though this would be a good change for her but i can see that we are headed back to beneful .

nice coffee - not much flavor nice coffee if you like a bolder coffee . did not have much " mudslide " flavor . not one of my favorites . 
=================
eh . . well , it's okay , but why buy it ? i just don't see the reason why you should buy this when there's a box of pocky , stikko , and pretty much any other chocolate - related product sitting right next to it . you've got a couple bucks , why buy this when you could buy something much better with your money ? these have the same problem i had with pocky - - sure , the chocolate part is good , but when you get to the bread ( ? ) it's just bland as heck and out of place . i'd rather just buy a chocolate bar made by the same company , ya'know ? and don't misunderstand - - there is absolutely no bread inside the chocolate part of the candy , at least any that matters enough that you can taste it . why can't they just be split apart and sold as two different candies ? that'd how i felt when i ate it . ( but then again , the bread ( ? ) part of it isn't all that great in the first place , enough to be sold . ) they're cute . that's pretty much it . i just don't see why i'd ever eat these unless someone else bought them and offered them to me . they're not bad - - but they're just stupid . stupid in candy design . unbalanced . it's like buying lucky charms and picking out the marshmellows , really . that's what it feels like . and again , i must ask , why do you buy lucky charms if you could easily just buy a cereal completely made out of marshmellows ? also , for the cute mushroom aspect - - the mushroom tops are always tipped sideways . that's also a damper when the packaging clearly makes them all look like they're balanced . 
=================
works for dogs too i actually bought this for my dog to use . i have a mini dachshund and he uses a dog potty called ugodog . i tried the dog pottys with the artificial grass on top and they just smelled awful because the urine clings to the grass and my dog didn't want to use it ( i don't blame him ) . i put the ugodog out on the patio and he uses a sliding glass doggie door to go out . i put about 1 1 / 2 cups of pine pellets in the ugodog tray which is lined with plastic - - i buy the glad odorshield tall 13 gal . trash bags and cut them in half because cat box liners didn't fit . then the grate goes on top . i change the pellets about once a week or every 5 days and the pine completely covers the urine odor . it's easy to lift out the liner and fold up and dispose of the used pellets and solids are flushed . i tried using paper instead of the pine pellets , but they smelled and were not as absorbent . highly recommend the pellets . 
=================
very bland and weak coffee i will admit that i like strong flavorful but not burnt tasting coffee . i give four stars to the tully house blend , but this breakfast blend is quite weak . after ordering fifty of them , my husband and i in desperation have been trying to use them up by putting a kcup on espresso setting and using 2 - 3 kcups on expresso as needed to fill up our coffee cup . i'm sure it's a fine kcup if you like weak coffee , but . . .

vanilla orgain the taste is good , but there are congealed chunks at the bottom . they do not go away no matter how much you shake the container . i will never order vanilla again .

after taste this gum tastes good at first but it has an 'interesting' tomato aftertaste that really lingers .

better than sex ? dilettante chocolate is from seattle , where i moved away from about six months ago . i make my own mocha in the morning and when i moved , i couldn't find any product , anywhere , at any price , that truly replicated the flavor of ephemere . as an aside , this stuff tastes great on ice cream , on a spoon . . . or what have you . anyway , i find the semisweet better for coffee drinks than bittersweet ( even though i prefer very dark chocolate for eating - usually between 75 - 85 % . ) somehow , the little extra sugar brings out the chocolate flavor in the drink better . i use less of this than the bittersweet , which saves both money and calories , and what's not to like about that ? on the price front , the dilettante semisweet ephemere sauce , 22 - ounce packages ( pack of 2 ) is less expensive than the best price i ever found at a store actually in seattle . i know , now that i've said this , that the price will go up , but i'm positive it will still be cheaper . several years ago , dilettante reformulated ephemere to be all - natural , which is awesome . the only drawback , if you can call it that , is that it used to be shelf - stable . now , you have to refrigerate after opening , which makes it very , very dense . this observation leaves me wanting to share this little aside : my sister - in - law finds the visual texture of this stuff off - putting ; i will not say what she compares it to . it's so thick , however , that you have to microwave it for about 15 seconds after about a quarter of the bottle is empty , so her unappealing comparison is moot . if you like dark chocolate in things and not just for eating from a bar , you will not be disappointed in ephemere . if you like milder chocolate , go for the milk chocolate version . if you like bittersweet , your decision between semi and bittersweet , like mine , will be a little more difficult . i feel so strongly about this product that if i could give my phone number out to anyone who disagrees with my assessment to call and berate me , i would . warning : do not be surprised if you find yourself pattering off to the fridge half asleep in the middle of the night for a dollop of this on a spoon . you've been warned . 
=================
more caramel corn taste i was expecting more cinnamon flavor due to the cinnabon name . it was closer to regular carmel corn on a sugar high . i am diabetic and enjoy a sugary snack on special occasions ( once a month ) . this product was like eating syrup straight from the bottle . i will go back to cracker jack to satisfy my sweet tooth . 
=================
do not buy from theonlinecandy store ! ! ! ! my mother and my father had ordered this as an easter gift for me . they bought in " the online candy shop " trough amazon on april 9th and payed $ 25 . 00 for expedited delivery . they told me i should receive it by the 12th at the latest , because as stated in the store's shipping policy , expedited to us address takes 1 - 3 business days . not only i just received it late afternoon on 04 / 16 , when i opened the box all i could find was melted chocolate all around . i was very very upset and even more when i came to amazon to leave a neg review and found out it was supposed to be shipped with a gift wrap and nice bow . that's what my parents had payed for ( and obviously to send me edible chocolate ! ) . and i was amazed to see that in the shop's shipping policies i found the information : " expedited orders will be packed with reusable ice packs and insulation at no additional charge . the online candy shop is not responsible for damage of meltable items during shipping , unless an expedited shipping method is chosen . " in my case , the expedited shipping didn't come with ice packs and insulation , and neither the nice gift wrap that's in the product description page . not to mention is is not 1 pound of chocolate . it's written on the box , it's 14 ounces . never buy from this store . i never had even a slight problem with amazon marketplace purchases before .

i fed my son mystery formula for months ! ! ! ! ! after reading other customer reviews about a different label being underneath the earth's best label i went to look under my labels . sure enough there is the same light blue label remains as in the other customer reviews . i am so upset that i don't know what i have been feeding my baby ! i thought i was feeding him good formula . if anyone finds out what it actually is i would love to know . don't order this formula from amazon !

small can it is a good thing the can is so small . the product is several cuts below sunny delight . terrible !

steaks i ordered these steaks for a party i was having . when i received the steaks i received 12 instead of 16 . i contacted omaha steaks and they said i got what i ordered . i had to file a claim with amazon to get my issue resolved . the issue was resolved to my satisfaction . 
=================
incredibly spicy i love muir glen products in general , so i took a chance on this . word of caution : it's really spicy . our kids hated it . 
=================
love 'em ! i read the reviews and was influenced to try these suckers based on the positive reviews . i don't necessarily buy all the organic hype about them . i do like the fact that there are no chemical dyes in them though . they all taste great to me . they don't leave an unpleasant aftertaste and they are average sized . someone said they were really small . i was expecting dum dum size , but they are flat and nearly full sized . so , if you like to have hard candy around , these aren't a bad option . 
=================
great , but unfair price this is a great bone that lasts my dogs forever , but you can buy them in dollar stores ! totally unfair to charge 7x the price !

good , but no nurnberger . these sausages are very good , but they are not the nurnberger style i had when i lived in nurnberg and ate many many times at the schnellimbiss stands . this version is much larger and more of a regular , off white brat . my search continues . . . 
=================
received my beans today i was super excited to find my beans in the mail today , i placed my order on sunday and they shipped on monday . i was however a bit disappointed when there were only 43 beans in the package . i was truly hoping to get closer to the approx 54 they state . the beans were very aromatic and to me they seemed quite nice . i have never dealt with vanilla beans before so i guess my comparison is quite limited : ) i am using them to make my own pure vanilla for baking so i guess i will find out in 6 mos how it turns out . nice buy but disappointed in how many i received . eta : after thinking about my review , i wasn't thinking about the fact that these are measured by weight . that does make a big difference . i was disappointed because the recipe i was using called for 40 beans and in the end i only had 3 leftover to use for something else . i will definitely be buying more though ! 
=================
very disappointed , not durable at all i bought this toy because it touted being the most durable soft dog toy available . my dog loves to chew and really enjoys a soft squeaky toy . i was impressed by the " 7 rows of stitching " and " 4 layers of material " and thought it would be worth a try . my 60 lb . border collie mix was through all of it in less than 5 minutes and pulling the stuffing out . the toy i got at the dollar store lasted longer . if you are looking for a durable toy , i suggest looking elsewhere . 
=================
wowee if you put it in the freezer and let it freeze it is like eating two cups of chocolate candy . i wonder how many calories there are in two cups of chocolate candy . 
=================
incredibly low quality evoo this extra virgin olive oil is one of the lowest quality evoos i have ever tasted . it is very bitter if you taste it on a stand alone sip from a spoon and compare it with a true pure extra virgin olive oil ( which tend to be much more expensive . . . you get what you pay for ) . i have tasted dozens of olive oils from around the world . the reason the price is so low is because the quality is incredibly low . 
=================
almost a glass bottle would have been better , it looked like glass in the photo , i didn't pay close enough attention . i usually avoid plastic amap especially after going to the expense of buying organic ! i do not use molasses that much so i am not a good judge of the quality . i figure organic is the safest way to go . i use it mostly to make brown sugar ( regular sugar + molasses = brown sugar . . . . . i don't even mix it , just put both in my recipe . . . . careful , a little goes a long ways ! ) 
=================
tasty , but the picture is misleading this cup - o - noodles knock off is fine tasting . it is not as aggressively hot as some korean foods . i would call it mild to medium - minus in the spiciness arena . it has instructions for both microwave and " add boiling water " methods of preparation . the one reason i would take off a star is that the picture on the top implies wholesome chunks of chicken and veggies . what you get are noodles that look like the noodles . broth looks similar , too . the meat and veggie particles are tiny , 6mm chunks . you really won't have to sharpen the teeth for this stuff because the meat is so small . i am sure that there is some fine print saying it's a serving suggestion and you should add your chunks of meat and vegetables , but given that , they should have just not attempted to put the tiny freeze dried pellets in there . one of those things that highlights the issue . 
=================
use for pound cake i have used this mix for years for yellow pound cake and everyone seems to love it . i'm still able to purchase the 18oz . at my local grocery . i was going to order this product , but saw that it was 16 . 5 oz . and was afraid it wouldn't go with the old duncan hines pound cake recipe . hope these companies realize the damage they are doing to time proven recipes when they downsize their products . 
=================
these bulk energy drink prices are outrageous i thought i'd check online to see if buying energy drinks in bulk would be cheaper than buying the 4 - 8 packs in my local grocery store . well they're not . at all . in fact the cost of this 8 pack , when you add shipping , is over twice what you'd pay if you bought 8 individually in a convenience store ( give or take some for tax ) 
=================
incomplete description of the ingredients , sold after best due date 8 / 2409 the seller description of this item , on the amazon site , was different from the one on the box that i received . the tea has been described as " blackberry and elder flowers infusion " , instead the tea description is " natural blackberry flavor ( 16 % ) , licorice root ( i am not a big fun of this ingredient ) , and poppy flower ( ? ) , apple pieces , blackcurrant leaves , only 8 % elder flowers . i am sure somebody will like the tea , but for me is important to buy what i would like , and the seller to disclose all the ingredients . maybe the tea is good for other people . plus , the best use by 8 / 24 / 09 is another reason to offer this seller one star !

there are better choices out there this cereal is masquerading as healthy . yes , it is organic and gluten - free , but it also is a processed food containing a fair amount of sugar at 7g per serving ( second ingredient is organic evaporated cane juice ) and gets its fiber from added inulin ( and maybe additional sweetening from this ingredient ) , rather than just from whole grains . the major grain constituents of corn meal / flour and brown rice flour are not the healthiest grain ingredients but might be needed to get a decent gluten free cereal ( this contains no oats , which are also gluten free ) . the amount of fiber per serving is 3g , not too great for a healthy cereal . this is not a fortified cereal , so vitamin a , c and calcium are 0 % and iron only 4 % of rda . the package is somewhat deceptive in that it lists a serving as having relatively low calories ( 110 calories ) , but the reason becomes evident when looking into the serving size . the cereal serving size is 2 / 3c = 30g = 1 . 10 oz , which is smaller when compared to standard natural cereal serving sizes ( which i have found to be more in the 1 . 5 to 1 . 8 oz range ) , so this is the reason that the calories appear lower . possibly this serving size may be more appropriate for children . as an adult , eating only 1 . 10 oz of this cereal does not fill me up . the cereal tastes pretty good , if you like a sweet cereal , and i think kids would like this . it appears to be a mixture of organic versions of kix ( hollow corn spheres ) , tiny rice krispies and some kind of fiber flakes , with tiny bits of other stuff ( possibly sugar coated puffed quinoa etc ) . maybe it has a hint of vanilla flavor , but it mostly tasted sweet to me . it was quite good with fresh sliced strawberries on top and regular milk . the cereal did not appear as appetizing as the glossy photo on the package . the box is only 10 . 6oz , so it won't last long if increasing the amount per serving and thus is not the best value . i suppose this cereal may be a good option for people who need a tasty / sugary gluten - free cereal . but there certainly are healthier and cheaper options out there ( even standard oatmeal ) . rated 2 1 / 2 stars , rounded down to 2 stars .

deadly if you fertilze this soil is unpredictable , except that it's definitely deadly if you add fertilizer during the first two months . by unpredictable , i mean even without adding fertilizer , it may burn your plants due to hot spots in the soil , where the 6 months of time release nutrients come out all at once . don't use this on prize garden stock without testing first . you simply cannot control the nutrient uptake with this potting soil .

stay away - will raise your blood sugar - not good for low carb or diabetics so i had been looking around for someone diabetic who could post their sugars after eating a chocoperfection bar , since the company makes so many zero glycemic index claims . i'm not diabetic , so i figured my results wouldn't help anyone . well , after not finding anyone who had done this experiment , i just figured i'd give it a shot . i'm not diabetic , and i'd imagine if you were , your results would be way higher . i took my blood sugar at the 00 : 00 mark , and the ate the bar . then i took my blood sugar again once every 10 minutes for an hour . 00 : 00 7500 : 10 7300 : 20 8200 : 30 8300 : 40 8300 : 50 9100 : 60 93for me , almost 20 points difference in an hour , is major . i won't be eating them . i could eat a bag of skittles for the same glycemic cost . i don't know if it is the glycemic index , or the insulin response , or the leptin response that causes this fluctuation , i just know i don't need it .

dont want decaf hi ordered to taste different coffees what i did not relize that 25 percent would be decafe . would like more for four or six instead of two of each type to try . also dont want to try decafe brands for me a waste of time drinking coffee . 
=================
this flavor is great , but there's something wrong here i found this flavor at my local supermarket , 12 cups for $ 6 . 99 . i loved it - it has more chocolate flavor than timothy's mocha java ; unfortunately , it contains real sugar too so a cup is 60 calories . i recommend using the middle size cup when you make this ; the larger size seems to make it too watery . there will still be product left in the cup when using the middle size , so i cut the top open and either spoon it out or add liquid from the cup of coffee to get all of the chocolate / coffee " syrup . " i add half & half and sometimes a packet of splenda - you can jazz it up however you like . the pricing here on amazon has to be a mistake , which is disappointing because i was definitely interested in stashing up on this particular flavor .

maybe o . k . for baby : not for lactose intolerant adults . i bought this , oddly enough , as a lactose - free substitute for condensed milk for baking recipes . it's o . k . , but it tastes really metallic . i'm wondering if the metallic taste means that it reacts with the can ? and if that's the case , should we be feeding it to infants ?

glass bottle shattered right in front of my 10 month old and cut her ! my 10 month old daughter had her normal bottle this afternoon . we've been using both the glass and plastic born - free bottles exclusively since she was six months with no previous problems . this afternoon , she grabbed ahold of the bottle by the nipple and gave it a good thunk on the floor . the entire bottle shattered into tiny shards right in front of her ! fortunately her caretaker was quick enough to get her out of the way but not before a piece of glass cut her foot . i am so angry , something much worse could have happened . i filed a report on this brand of glass bottle with the national consumer safety commission .

sip the incipid the matcha content is too low to matter falvor - wise , and the tea itself is sadly incipid . i use only about 5 oz water , and the tea is still too bland , yet with slite bitterness . i much prefer , fo example , barry's green tea , with no matcha promises , but a strong rich flavor , and a price signifly less than this stuff . gonna buy some good quality matcha and add it to green drinks , rather than brew a cuppa 4 or 5 times / day . and just as important , more points off for excess packing . let's not forget nylon , as in nylon teabags , and that junk sticks around - - who needs it ! 
=================
i've had better i bought a bunch of the kitchens of india items during a promotional sale and the only one i'd recommend is the butter chicken sauce . if they were tasty i could overlook the salt content for the occasional enjoyment but i'm not loving the taste . i ofter buy similar products from trader joes and those , in my opinion , are much better and cost far less . 
=================
natural balance treats - out of balance i normally like the natural balance sweet potato & venison or sweet potato and bison . but this 14oz bag came busted up and the treats are a bigger size than the size in a smaller bag . the treats were really brittle and broke easily . i wouldn't buy this one any more but will buy the smaller ones in a store . 
=================
heart shaped lucky bamboo the bamboo arrived about 2 weeks after ordering , all intact and well packed . however , there were no instructions for caring of the bamboo . it is now almost a month since arriving and part of the bamboo stalk looks like it is dying and turning brown ( part of the heart shape ) . i would buy more from this company if the shipping wasn't so costly ( for the area where i live the shipping was about $ 10 and the product itself $ 15 ) . 
=================
not organic i thought i was buying the organic , but this was relatively good . i used it all , won't be buying it again .

enormous enormous amount of yeast . will save a lot if you use a lot . hope it stays active . works well so far . there were two products available on amazon , they were both the same yeast product , but one had free shipping . free shipping was the better deal .

food color ? princess loved this , and she'd get it as a treat - - then later on in her life when she was dying and was very fussy about eating , she would eat this , or at least some of it , and would refuse any other kinds of cat food . i was able to mix cee cee's powdered cat antibiotics in fancy feast when she was recovering from a burst abscess , and she'd eat all the food , with the antibiotics . but i always wondered about the color of this food - - it seemed pretty bright for the combinations of meats and fish that were in it - - is there alot of food color in this food ? ? ? 
=================
what is the carbon footprint of this product ? i'm a little shocked that this so - called health food product is made from chinese grown ingredients . i'd be curious to see what the carbon footprint of each bite is . also keep in mind that chinese ingredients and products have been found to have all kinds of contaminants such as lead in toys and melamine in milk and other exported food products . all the ingredients in this snack are widely available in the united states . why not support products and companies who source locally and consider our own economy before we sell out for a slightly cheaper price ? your purchasing choice does make a difference . let's stop expecting corporations and governments to take care of our safety and economy . they never will . we can change the way these companies do business for the benefit of our long term health and economical well - being . make purchase decisions wisely . 
=================
good price , small packages are perfect but stale good price , perfect size small packages , but the first box , 2nd box , 3rd box all were stale . a first for an amazon food product . it's happened with others selling on amazon but never a product from amazon . bummer
=================
haagen daaz it ain't , but . . . . . . . haagen daaz it ain't , but . . . . . . . it ain't bad . at least the chocolate isn't . i tried the strawberry banana and i've got to say that it was awful , i actually found it unpleasent to the point where it was ineatable . on the other hand the chocolate was not bad at all . no one is ever going to mistake it for " real " ice cream , but at 128 calories for a pint of frozen dessert treat it tastes pretty damn good . at least it satisfys the craving for something " sinful " , without blowing your diet . 128 calories versus 1000 plus calories ? ? ? ? no contest - save the haagen daaz for really special occassions . 
=================
tooo sweet wish i liked it more . very good ingredients listed . but it's wayyyy too sweet for me , which ditracts drom the flavor of the meat itself

35 different k - cups it arrived on - time in a paper bag . there were 35 different k - cups . 2 hot chocolates , 1 cider , 2 teas , 2 decaff coffees , and the remainder different regular and bolds . some were flavored . many were " name " brands like wolfgang puck . no one company had more than 4 k - cups . none were expired ( though they didn't all have an obvious date ) . none were bizarre flavors . it was exactly as described . 
=================
it's arlight well i have been taking this product for a week now . the first time i took it , wow ! ! ! i had a lot of energy . i felt as if i was never going to get off the treadmill . i was able to run on a high number speed for miles . it kind of wore off when i went to go workout with some free weights . this was after about 45 mins . well then i took it again the next day but this time there was no burst of energy . i am still taking it and it's sad to say i do not get that energy anymore like the first time . perhaps it works different for everyone but i will not be buying this again
=================
overpriced love these , but $ 6 . 65 per package ? ? ? ? that's crazy when they went for $ 2 . 50 - 3 . 50 in the stores ( meijer , walmart , kroger ) . nice flavor and my favorite but no way would pay this much for what is essentially sugarfree koolaid . 
=================
sad to say it didn't work for me . . . . after my bad cholesterol hit a high of 167 my doc gave me 3 months to make some changes before we considered medications . after some research and reading the reviews here i decided to give these chews a try . i also cut out red meat , cheese , switched to non - fat milk and ate more produce . i had 2 of these per day for the last 8 weeks , 1 after lunch and 1 after dinner . i had my repeat blood work done two days ago and my bad cholesterol is now at 177 . . . . : o ( up 10 points in 3 months . glad it works for so many , but don't assume they'll work for you and don't avoid follow - up appointments with your doctor thinking you have nothing to worry about . you might just be one of the unlucky ones like me . . . 
=================
read the ingredients this one is probably okay if you don't have any problems with hfcs or aspartame , which i do . they trigger migraines , for me at least . like a dummy , i bought a box based on the commercials , my bad . it has both sweeteners in all the varieties of this brand . i'm not crazy about the taste of kashi golean , but at least i know i'm putting a healthy fiber cereal in my tummy . the same with ezekiel flax cereal , seriously healthy , not a lot of taste , but hey , life is about more than a momentary sweet taste in our mouths . 
=================
not buying again my husband wanted to buy this for me on a whim , because i am sensitive to gluten . i should have said no , not until i check all reviews . i actually love garbanzo beans so i thought why not try it ? i used only 1 / 6 of this flour in a puffed pear pancake recipe from real simple . i used apples instead of pears and extra sugar / cinnamon . i also added some sugar to the batter to try and help cover up any bad flavor . i am not sure why i thought there would be some , but i did . maybe it had started to smell funny already ? well , i baked 2 apple pancakes . 1 normal and 1 gluten free . i baked them at the same time in the same oven . that's when i started smelling the yucky smell . i was afraid the good one would be contaminated . thankfully it wasn't . i have yet to offer the gf one to the rest of the family since they have their own . no one else commented on the yucky smell , so maybe i am just hyper sensitive to it . maybe you do have to make something savory not sweet to enjoy it . all i can say is i am glad only 1 / 6 of the flour i used was this stuff . the rest was rice , tapioca , and potato . i am new to making my own baking flour mixes . but i have used specialty gf bread flours to make bread and it was delicious ! it didn't rise quite right but the flavor was like french bread . i even eat dry crumbly rice bread and that's okay with me . i have even made white bean muffins when on the south beach diet and those didn't have a weird , toxic taste / aftertaste / smell . so i plan on trying some other way to use this stuff , but if that doesn't work it is in the trash or i will offer it to a local person who may want to try some free gf flour . maybe they won't notice the taste / smell . 
=================
soup is tasty butttttt i purchased this as the winter months are upon us . however who invented the container that the soup is packaged in needs to go back to the drawing table . as the product is heating in the microwave , they tip over spilling the contents . so not only have you lost your meal but a big mess to clean up too . i have a case to use up so will just empty into a mug to heat . 
=================
nice as breading for frying . . . these crackers have nice flavor . they can be used to coat chicken for frying . . . so many of them were broken anyway , i just crunched them a little bit more . . . and problem solved . not enough of them fit to present at the table . this is second time ordered with this outcome . 
=================
shipping costs it is true that the shipping costs really make this some mighty expensive product ! i have a disability and sometimes like delivery on heavier items - believe it or not when i have to order from a local , nationwide office supply chain i can throw in a case of cokes and the shipping is the same as the other items - much better way if you want or need to have it delivered . otherwise - i buy smaller quantities and make a few trips to the car ! : ) 
=================
their motto : if it doesn't suck it isn't silk ! i can't comment on the other flavors of silk soy " milk " but this flavor is the most disgusting thing i've ever tasted ! to me it's truly a sin to waste food and i've been know to eat or drink things that were merely abhorrent rather than throw them out , but after one swallow of this liquid refuse i poured the rest of it down the sink . because my wife is lactose intolerant i foolishly thought the silk company could make passable " yogurt " since it had added flavors , but no , the predominant flavor was some vague aftertaste that seemed somehow off , as if they used motor oil as an ingredient . my wife experienced it too , so it isn't just me . funny that o'soy tastes just like regular yogurt and has no aftertaste . for a delicious milk substitute , try rice dream . the original tastes just like milk while the vanilla tastes just like ice cream ! as a bonus , neither o'soy nor rice dream have sanctimonious commercials filled with sanctimonious actors / athletes who have obviously either never tried a silk product or they were paid very big bucks to mislead the naive and trusting populous . 
=================
i didn't see the sticker there was a sticker placed on the package of tea that said it was roobios tea . it wasn't printed on the box , just the sticker . at first that made me think that it was just plain tea . i will take ther word as to the sticker that it is what i ordered . sorry for the mishap . the tea is very good . 
=================
chia seeds good price to high i purchased the chia seeds , i did not realize it said 1 oz . if i would have realized it was 1 oz instead of 1 lb . i would not have purchase the product . 11 . 95 for 1 oz of chia seeds is over priced . shiping for 1 oz . is even less then the price i paid . when i order chia seeds i look forward to making bread and smoothies i know next time to read a little closer . 
=================
vomitous one's first thoughts on eating this cereal are of the bathroom , and for two reasons . first , that's where its taste seems to come from , and second , because that's where any mouthful should immediately be coughed up . the best that can be said about krave is that it will , one hopes , soon be off the market . its commercial success , if it wins any , will mean only that america's taste buds have finally succumbed to their long - sustained beating at the hands of disgusting products that companies try to pass off as 'food . '

read the fine print ! be careful when ordering this item , i expected for every type of tea pictured to come in the pack , however what comes is based on availability and there were two kinds replaced with more of others . i still received the correct number of teas , i just should have read the description more carefully . 
=================
defectve product - promptly replaced ! i just bought six dozen millstone breakfast blend light roast k cups and am having a problem . water does not come out of the cups i have tried . the machine works fine with other cups however with the new cups out of the batch i just bought water does not come out of them . best if used by feb 11 , 2013 2138725 pl054 14 : 48 is on the back of the box . since amazon will not accept food products for refund or replacement . i guess i am out $ 43 . 92 with no recourse . update i contacted keurig , they sent me credit for the defective k cups . it seems keurig buys coffee from coffee companies and they put it into k cups . any problem with getting the coffee out of the k cups is keurigs job to solve . 
=================
what a crock ! ! the bag itself says " $ 10 . 49 " ! ! ! regular list price for amazon , almost $ 50 ? ? ? but you can have it for the low low bargain of $ 20 ! ! yes , you can buy a $ 11 bag of cat food for $ 20 ! ! act now and get a free proctology exam at your local bus station !

not bad - just too costly first of all - the seaweed salad , following directions , isn't at all bad . however , the serving size is very small . when i made up 2 packs , one for myself and one for my wife , we looked at the quantity of salad in each of our cups , and realized that it was definitely not worth $ 2 for each serving . one suggestion i have is that you add the dressing a little at a time . the first time we made up each cup , we used the entire packet - it was too strong . for our taste , one packet divided between 2 cups was just right . except for the price , i would have ordered more . when we bought this item , it was $ 12 for 6 individual servings . 
=================
get the dark roast instead ! the senseo machine shipped with two 18 - pod samples packs , light roast and medium roast . excited about my new machine , i brewed my first cups of coffee only to be disappointed , not by the machine itself ( awesome ! ) , but by the quality of the coffee . the light roast was so - so , and the medium terrible . i quickly ordered the dark to compare , and can now highly recommend the dark roast over the other two options . the dark also works the best in espresso - like brewing mode , using two - pods with the 1 - cup setting . it's still not the best coffee out there , and i'm looking forward to comparing with the upcoming podhead . com pods . 
=================
received wrong item i ordered the light roast , but received a collection of different flavors . my husband does not like flavors . the description did not say different flavors and the picture here does not match the picture on what we received . ours says includes coffee house regular , chocolate glazed , cinamon and decaf . the item ordered does not say that . i think it was a fluke and we got the wrong item . can you please send us the correct item ? i've never had this problem with amazon before . thanks . mary

it was broken ! when the tree was delivered it looked great , but i noticed after about 2 - 3 weeks it started dying . later i looked closely and the tree had been broken at the trunk . . . . too late to send it back to amazon ! i have ordered 3 other ficus trees and they are great . maybe it broke during shipment , but i will not order another jade bonsai . i see others rating it highly and i probably just got a bad one or it was damaged during packing or shipping , so take this review with a grain of salt . . . . please look very closely at the tree upon arrival . . . . inspect the trunk for any breaks .

my cats were un responsive i've had cats my whole life and catnip is a mysterious thing that i sure don't understand . they say not all cats are affected ( which could be a made up lie someone in the catnip industry created ) so you never know if its the cat or the catnip brand or maybe the cat just needs to be in the mood . all i can tell you is this : my neighbor bought some catnip and gave me some for my cats . my cats went crazy ! the female rolled in it over and over . so i ordered some of my own . only i couldn't remember what my neighbor brought so i ordered this one , the sojos . the sojos did nothing at all for my cat . sure , it was fragrant , but the cat wasn't interested . i have ordered the exact same brand my neighbor brought over ( frontier ) and when it comes i will update this after the kitties try it . i will find out if kitties are particular to brand or if they need to be in a catnip mood .

snap , crackle and pop ! i used clear scalp and hair beauty damage & color repair nourishing conditioner for some time before i finally wrote this review . at first , i liked it very much . i am a conditioner junkie , and will give any new product a shot if it seems to fill the bill . however , my initial delight with this conditioner sent me running back to my other conditioners when i realized that the initial softness that i felt was being replaced by a dry , brittle feeling - - almost as though i had left soap in my hair . not good at all ! furthermore , when i gently comb through my hair when it is dry , i am suddenly experiencing breakage , and this is not a problem i had before i used this conditioner . in essence , i do not recommend this product , and i am glad that i waited long enough to have gone almost through the entire bottle so that i could be sure about my results . fyi , i always thoroughly rinse my hair out in the shower , but the residue from clear scalp & hair seems almost impossible to get out .

cool toy , too bad my dog is too stupid oh i mean , i love my dog . a lot . but he is far too dumb to figure this out . he instead just whacks me in the knee with it until i pull the rope out and bring some treats out . hmm . . . maybe he's not the dumb one . it's definitely challenging . frustrates my dog more than entertains him and is pretty formidable when connecting with sensitive kneecap tissue . 
=================
grab some oregano and call it a day ! i could discern little taste difference after mixing this with vinegar and olive oil as specified on the package . it's ok , but nothing really stands out with the flavoring . is it the " natural " angle they were going for here ? i'm not sure . maybe this might work better as a marinade mixture , but as for going to the trouble of mixing this with regular vinegar & olive oil , why bother ? 
=================
i agree it was fast shipment but . . . it was the first ever i've ordered a box of marzipan and the paper stuck to the assorted fruit pieces . it quite spoiled the treat for me . i will try a different source which was served to me at xmas . it was less expensive and just as delicious . shame on you bergen . 
=================
why 25 . 99 ? ? ? ? ? ? why are they a dollar more than if i bought the whole box at the liquor store ? ? ? ? we should be getting a better deal buying them in bulk online . . . in my opinion . . . come on ! 20 bucks i'll take it .

danger ! danger ! you'll not be able to stop eating these ! these mangoes are pure quality . no disgusting after - taste like so many other brands . there are no sulfites or added sweetners just the pure fruit . highly recommend them but beware because you will not be able to put them down . 
=================
shipping flawed i ordered two cases , 8 each , of the oregon red tart cherries . when i received the package , the two cases were in a large box with no packing at all . when i examined the cans , only four did not have any dents and four were badly dented . it did not appear that any of the cans seal had been broken , but it will be impossible to open the cans on the top . the cherries in the can i have used were very good . 
=================
from great to so - so these used to be my favorite bars from any brand . the company changed the recipe , and now i am really disappointed with the taste . i'm going to cancel my order subscription or reduce it . 
=================
brussel sprouts for your cat apparently this cat food represents the culmination of exhaustive research into feline nutrition . that may be the case , but good luck getting your cat to eat it . feeding this stuff to a finnicky cat is like trying to get a third grader to eat his broccoli . i have to coat it with friskies wet - food to even spark my bengal's interest , and she still eats around the core nuggets whenever possible . we haven't had this problem with other dried foods ( royal canin , et al . ) so i can only assume it's the specific taste or texture . back to the drawing board .

big surprise . a funny thing happened on amazon , i ordered a bluetooth adapter for my ipod classic and after much anticipation , i get dumpling mix from germany . wow , i would think that someone would validate such an absurd order . after getting burned like this , i intend not to use this service any longer and i feel they lack the quality control required to validate orders correctly . dumpling mix in lieu of an adapter . . . thanks a lot ! ! ! here is my review !

good price , ok quality this jerky tastes okay , but it seems like this isn't made from the best quality meat . i don't know if i got a bad batch , but all the jerky i ate had hard veins running through them . all in all , i would give 2 . 5 stars , but since i can't , and i don't like rounding up , i have to go with 2 . pros : the jerky is tender , but not overly tender . it is a good consistancy ( except for the occassional tough fiber running through them ) . cons : the quality of the meat was sub par , which says a lot , since you don't need the best cuts to make jerky ( its basically dried ground meat ) . as the other reviewers pointed out , the package says the beef could be from usa or from a variety of other countries . i'm pretty certain mine didn't come from the us . neutral : the flavor was okay . it wasn't bad , but it wasn't anything special either . there are many other jerkys out there that have outstanding flavor .

perfect ! ! ! ! i got for a christas gift the starbuckd three pack with the choch covefed espreson beans , choch coverev chrerries and the chock covdred alomod bars . while the later was , least favofite , the former two blew my mind with all their chocholatey goodess . needless to say when the season was over so were the chocholates ; so i became a woman on a mssion . i found then ! ( not the brand , of course ) , ghiradelli is next to perfect ! i love them so much not only did i order one order of three choch covered espresso beans , but two of the choch covered cherries . ok , so i love then so much i placed two more orders , only this time with more of the cherries . now , that said , i've never been a fan of the choch covered cherries , but these are not like the the traditional cordials with that gooey liquidy center that makes them too sweet for my taste . needless to say i'll have enough to last me a while . . . at least a week or so , lol . enoy ! oh , did i mention the packges are small . . . but dont all good things come in small packages ? rachel

easy to take with you , cost is a little high , i don't like this flavor at all . this is a concentrated water enhancer that doesn't need to be refrigerated and can be taken anywhere . what i like about mio is that i can take it with me on the road and turn any water into flavored water . i have never liked to drink plain tap water but mio can change that . each bottle is said to last 24 servings but it will change depending on your personal taste . one serving is a brief squirt or ½ teaspoon of mio . it's doesn't have any calories or carbs which is important to me because i am trying watch my weight . i have tried other flavors that were better but i don't like the sweet tea flavor at all . it tastes exactly like what it is fake tea . it hardly resembles the taste of tea at all with all in my opinion . i could hardly finish a couple glasses of it and would not get it again . i let my wife try it and she liked it so it will obviously depend on your individual taste . the cost seems high for such a small bottle but it will flavor 192 oz . of water .

nice candy , flavorful and toothsome , but maybe not quite so green newman's own ( organics ) pomegranite licorice is a red chewey twisty stick ( tube ) candy of the sort that most of us remember . it's sealed in a multilayer plastic - and - foil wrapper , which may lessen its appeal to the sustainable - use folks . the aroma and flavor are clear and memorable . had i not known that this was pomegranite - flavored , i might have labelled it black cherry , but pomegranite it is . it was just chewey enough to resist the tooth pleasantly . the list of ingredients is much as expected , except that the sugar and starch sources are described as " organic " ( except for the corn syrup , which follows flour and sugar , but precedes tapioca starch ) . the glycerin is listed as " vegetable glycerin " and the package bears one of the familiar kosher markings , along with the designation pareve . this package is marked best if used before mar 11 2012 . i don't know the date of manufacture , but the package says it was made in mexico and certified organic by oregon tilth . so . . . this is the familiar candy of your childhood , only a little bit better , or a lot better if you enjoy the aroma first . there were a generous 18 pieces in the package i received . they call it " about 3 and one half servings " but i think it could be five or six , even though the sticks are shorter than the candy store variety and maybe a little thinner . i'm taking a star off for advertising it as " organic " ( which it is ) while sealing it ( for good reason ) in a foil - and - plastic multilayer pouch . 
=================
love this product , but . . . . . . it would not dissolve fully . product from local grocery dissolved fine , but what i bought from amazon left chunks of product in the iced tea . very strange . but do buy this product somewhere ! no glycemic index , no carbs , no calories . splenda and even other stevia products can't match those stats ! cheers !

instead purchase rescue . . . i tried this flytrap because my store was out of the rescue brand ( sterling nft - d disposable fly control trapwith attractant ) . this victor has not caught one fly in four days , while my existing rescue trap has and is catching 50 + flies per day . yes the rescue does smell bad - you have to put it 10 + feet from your porch , but it works ! i place one in the trees approx . 20' away on 'each' side of the house . i recommend buying the rescue flytrap - amazon search " rescue fly trap " .

results vary for hot air poppers some good results some bad . . . , october 16 , 2009by v . sandy " v " ( prescott , az ) - see all my reviewsamazon verified purchase ( what's this ? ) i bought the 12 bottle variety to try out . i just recently started using a hot air popper so wanted to see what varieties worked well . first off . the baby white and baby yellow kernels are just too light for use in a hot air popper . we did pop them at work using a traditional popper and they were fine . the are two varieties that stood out as my favorites for my hot air popper . the first is the wisconsin white birch , which popped up big , fluffy and close to zero unpopped or blow out kernels . the second is savannah gold , it popped up big , nice volume and again almost zero unpopped or blow out kernels . two varieties that are close seconds as favorites are : autumn blaze blend ( small , crisp , no unpopped kernels but quite a few blow outs ) and high mountain midnight ( some no pops , good volume ) . there was only one variety that i would not ever use again . the black hills had about 4 times the quantity of unpopped kernels as any of the other types , the kernels popped up very small , it was extremely hully and some kernels burnt in the hot air popper . orchard blossom , red river valley and harvest blend types all popped fine in my hot air popper with only a few unpopped kernels . the blue heron also popped fine with a few more unpopped kernels than the three mentioned in the sentence before ; it was also earthy in taste and popped up small kernels . savannah fire had very few close to no pops and was very chewy without being hully .

a little lumpy i like putting peanut butter in my protein shakes and was hoping pb2 would be the answer . it doesn't taste quite as good as creamy peanut butter and there is tiny hard lumps in my protein shake . i haven't tried using it in a blender to get the lumps out . i just use a shaker cup .

if you like to eat cardboard - this is the product for you my expectations for these bars were honestly not very high . i expected a very healthy filling bar that would be a good meal replacement if i was short on time . the problem is , these bars have little to no flavor and the texture of cardboard . ( not that i have ever eaten cardboard , but i can imagine . ) if they had a good flavor , or were salty or anything really i would give them a higher rating ; as they are definitely filling & good for you . the only reason i even gave them 2 stars was due to the fact that they do not have a bad flavor . due to the texture , which is the main event of this bar , and the only thing you notice without any flavor , i could not even finish one bar . really a shame , as i have whole box of them . maybe i can feed them to birds , as a very expensive treat . final notes , this is not a general comment against the go raw company , as i am a big fan of their spicy seed mix , salted sunflower seeds and chocolate granola . i will definitely try other products by this company , but i can guarantee you that i will not be purchasing any more bars , of any kind , from them . truly a waste of money .

this is how i plant them length : : 2 : 25 minsthey are oats , wheat , rye , and barley . in other words , they do seed if allowed to mature before getting killed by cats . since i do have a backyard with space to plant , i plant seeds in soil . it takes about 4 months to complete their life cycle . during their growth , i only pick off tips of the leaves so they could still continue to grow . only the last few days of seed maturing the leaves turn dry and yellow and are not edible . in return , i could get seeds " for free " to plant right away , as long as the weather allows it . i don't use any pest control or use any fertilizer , so certainly not all of the seeds would survive . aphids , with the help of ants , and snails do invade , and a slight strong gust could break their fragile stems . however , i could be sure that they are certainly organic through out the process . and the source of grass would not die down during the months they grow . in the end , the wood container becomes cat treat bag holder . anyhow , my russian blue is very rough at biting grass , so planting inside the box had been countless flip - overs and soil - spills . notes : if planting outside , remember to wash before feeding to cats , and certainly don't pick off parts that had been bitten by aphids or crawled by snails .

the company has made a promise to send the screen the company just contacted me to offer a full refund or send the screen and complimentary tea . as this was a christmas gift i chioose to let the company resolve this with my gift recipient receiving the gift as it was intended . they have made an attempt to correct the error . that greatly improves their status to me .

the best green tea i've found ! i've tried several green teas , both in bags and loose . numi organic temple of heaven gunpowder is by far the best . i like everything about it . the taste , the quality packaging to ensure freshness , the price , and the " gunpowder " pellets - it is easy to measure and know just how much you are actually using . two pounds lasts me about a month . i drink green tea mainly for the health benefits , which are too numerous to mention here . i drank white tea for quite a while but don't like full leaves because you have big pieces at the top of the bag and powder at the bottom , very inconsistent - if they made a quality white tea like this in gunpowder form i would likely alternate between that and this tea . i tried another gunpowder green tea ( in the same price range ) and compared it to numi . it was less densely packed and much darker ( indicating older tea or over - processing ? ) with significant extraneous matter in each one pound bag . i will drink this tea forever unless something better ( for the price ) comes my way but , after experimenting with different teas for about three years , i haven't felt inclined to find something different for at least a year now . . . i use the " subscribe and save " option so i get two 1 lb bags shipped every month for a 15 % discount and free shipping . there are other shipping options as well - up to once every six months . numi organic tea gunpowder green - full leaf , loose leaf , temple of heaven green tea , 16 oz bag ( pack of 2 )

leaky and messy it's just a plastic cap that costs them $ 0 . 02 to make and they sell it for a big markup . i've used it 4 - 5 times with different original k - cups . it a bit of a pain to clean out the k - cups and then if these kaps are used and not brewed right away , there is a hole at in the kap that allows air into the coffee to ruin the taste if stored over time and also allows the coffee to spill out if you tip it over . you can place a sticker over the hole or a piece of tape , but then that's another annoying step that detracts from the convenience of the k - cup . i'm going back to the commercially available k - cups and when i want to grind my own cup of coffee , it's quicker and less mess to use my french press with instant hot water from the 3l electric thermal hot pot my wife keeps for her tea . well , at least i can use these kaps as poker chips .

if you're too lazy to make your own . . . look , demitri's a seattle homie and i support anything our locals do in business but i think the hyperbole about this stuff is a little silly . is it a bad bloody mix ? absolutely not . it's flavorful and consistent . but i have never gotten why so many people seem to be so hell - bent on tarting up what is a very simple recipe . demitri's , like every other commercially - made recipe , tucks in a whole laundry list of extraneous flavors - baking spices , onions , jalapenos , etc . , etc . , etc . - that actually detract , imho , from the pungent , meaty quality of a great bloody . i've had this one and nearly every other mix out there and never had one that was anywhere near as good as we find here in seattle at temple billiards . finally , it hit me one day that i've been a chef my whole adult life and there was nothing stopping me from making my own . there's nothing stopping you either . it's fun and interesting and you can get exactly what you like . i'm not saying don't buy demitri's . if you're not creative ( or just really lazy ) , it's fine alternative . but a ) i don't like brown bloody mary's ( that should be called a dried - bloody mary ) and b ) it's just better because it's fresher . duh . if you enjoy demitri's , good on ya . but don't lose sight of the fact that you can make better ( or just as good ) right at home , for a lot less $ $ $ .

needs some tweaking - but fun treat toy nonetheless we have a 9 month old australian shepherd lab mix that loves to chew ( aka destroy ) . so , i went on amazon grabbed 3 toys ; the premier busy buddy bouncy bone ( medium ) , the premier busy buddy tug - a - jug ( small ) and jolly pet 4 . 5 " vanilla scented jolly critter squirrel . if i could my favorites in order , it would be the jolly critter suirrel , then the busy buddy bouncy bone , and lastly the tug - a - jug . there is little 'playability' for the bouncy bone . it is a very hard ( durable ) plastic that is not fun to throw in the house because of the worry of breaking something valuable . it is not soft at all ( not like the kong material ) . my dog wouldn't bring it back anyway because she just likes chewing the gnawhide off of it . the gnawhide is smelly ( what dog treat isn't though ? ) . we couldn't figure out why the house smelled so bad until i realized it was the gnawhide . my pup will chew the gnawhide off until there is a small circle left in the center . this leads to wasted product . however , i do give the small circles for our anti - toy sheltie to eat while i restock the bone w / new gnawhide for the puppy . as someone else stated , the gnawhide is gone within 10 - 15 minutes with my pup . so , even though i bought replacements with my order , we are going through them fast . we just got this toy on july 22 , 2008 ! lol
=================
tasty but not durable at all ! i purchased this nylabone for my 4 month old teething puppy . i figured she'd enjoy a tasty chew toy . she's quite the chewer so i was thinking the bone would last a day or two at best . however that was wishful thinking ! in less than 20 minutes , she had consumed all of it but the bulky end ( which we threw away ) . we couldn't believe how quickly she chewed it up ! definitely not worth the $ 8 .

arrived 8 days after the best before date i haven't even opened these yet , but i wanted to warn you - the 3 packages i received were already 8 days past the " best before " date printed on the package . i'm not super worried about using them , and probably will ( instead of returning them ) , but i would recommend buying from a source where you can check the date first .

i love these biscuits , but $ 11 . 99 ? i want to buy these . i ate them in africa , and they have that wonderful hard texture and gingery flavor . but really , 11 . 99 is about $ 7 . 00 too much . too bad . i was so excited , felt sure i would get at least two packets , but alas , no .

instant resolution of food allergy one of our 2 cats developed an apparent food allergy ( lots of vomiting ) to the friskies dry food we had been feeding them . doing research i found that the corn and soy included in such cheap cat food kibbles is often a culprit . switched to diamond and the gi distress immediately vanished and hasn't returned . our mildly fussy cats immediately took to the new food which i supplement with a little liver and nutritional yeast . both cats seem to be thriving on it with glistening coats and no illnesses whatever .

buyer beware kombucha is traditionally a combination of bacteria and yeast that is theoretically supposed to help balance the flora in your intestinal tract . while yogi teas tea box does not make these claims , they also fail to tell buyers that their kombucha tea contains both bacteria and yeast . they claim that the strains of bacteria and yeast are safe , however they stated to me that their product contains brewer's yeast which is known to aggravate even cause yeast infections in those prone to systemic yeast infections . they claim that the yeast is killed in the brewing process , but one can not be sure of this and if you are prone to systemic yeast infections , i would highly recommend that you avoid this product . they have already had one law suit filed against them by a woman who is convinced that their product caused her yeast infection .

barren creek beef jerky package came with the sweet bbq jerky and also a free sample of barren creek's top shelf jerky . that's a customer service + for me . unforunately , the sweet bbq is not great beef jerky . texture was poor , you get solid slabs of meat but they're quite dry . the flavor is odd too , definitely does not make me think of sweet and bbq . the top shelf jerky is quite good though , although a bit too salty . overall the product is not great , but it's a company i'd keep my eye on .

sauce needs work . i don't like roads end's cheese sauce . it needed at least twice as much liquid as they say to add . even then the sauce was gloppy and didn't taste particularly cheesy . i really wanted to love this as the price is so much better than namaste foods mac & cheese . namaste foods product is far superior . i also tried edward & sons cheese flavored mashed potatoes which contains roads end cheese sauce and it wasn't very good either . the other varieties of edward & sons potatoes were really delicious so the problem is roads end's cheese sauce mix . so disappointing . the pasta cooked up well though . i wish it were wheat free though .

too expensive ! i ordered six bottles of this from amazon and was shocked that they were so small ! eight ounces for almost $ 6 each ! a recipe might call for more than one bottle . fortunately karo no longer puts hfcs in their kight corn syrup and it's available in all the grocery store . so , that's what i'll be buying from now on ! 
=================
it's a crap shoot ! each roll is different , some are so tough it takes my lab a week to eat it and others are thin and brittle with tiny dry slivers of rawhide in the center and leave a huge mess behind , those he eats in a hour and about 50 % of the rolls are just fine . i found this to be the case on different bags i have purchased over a year apart . 
=================
smelly my cat loves this , and from what i've read , it's pretty high quality . at the same time , it has a very strong smell to it . we walked into the kitchen after buying it , saying , " what is that smell ? " it smells distinctly fishy , like someone left out tuna or something . if it was a faint smell , i wouldn't care , but this is a bit much . our house already smells too much from her litter box . we don't plan on buying this again .

defective k - cups ? i usually do not want to complain about a product but i just started using the brooklyn bean cyclone dark roast k - cups and have a issue with the k - cup itself . seems it likes to make a real mess of my coffee maker with grounds all over the place . i have not had a problem with any other k - cup brand coffee , just this one , perhaps some problem with how they were made . the few time i could get one to work in all fairness the coffee was good , thats why i have purchased this before . i have sent a email to the company and will see how they respond , for now i would suggest holding off purchasing until the problem is resolvedupdate : they responded to my email , i guess there was a batch problem afterall . amazon shoud not ship the defective batches and return them to brooklyn . on the positive side they will be sending me replacement coffee . i will update again when new coffee arrives . i would say at least they have good customer service . update 7 - 11 - 2012i received my replacement shipment for the defective k cups that i mentioned above along with a nice bonus of sample k cups . its hard to find a company anymore that stands behind their product but i can say 'brooklyn bean roastery " does bu responding quickly to my problem . customer service is still alive and well , i'm sure the coffee will exceed my expectations , the customer service sure has . 
=================
mediocre taste the dishes are very convenient , not doubt . however , i thought the taste was pretty middling at best . ( except the spinach with paneer . . . it was great ! ) also , some of the dishes gave me heartburn . conclusion of my review : by the 6 pack of the spinach paneer dish . i do . 
=================
new packaging + new recipe = great ! the old recipe was really sticky and the chocolate melted . it also tasted only ok . with this new packaging , it seems like they have also updated the recipe . it is now more solid , easier to eat , and less 'grassy' . i was going to cancel my subscription , but not anymore ! 
=================
those little elves are . . . living like trillionaires , for what the high cost of keeblers is . i found that the taste was a bit better than the store brand and there is no question to that , but the cost is just not worth the small difference . i wouldnt suggest a hit and run over one elve , may decrease the cost as there productivity should go up with fewer working elves . you know like the rest of us in this country , that need to work ten times as hard , to just make ends meet . 
=================
out of date product ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! having already ordered directly from cafe britt , i jumped at the chance to order cafe britt product from amazon thus saving shipping costs and even getting a break on the price . my experience dealing with cafe britt was great . i ordered the 2lb bag of whole bean costa rica dark roast coffee and loved it . wanting to try something different , i ordered 2 1lb bags of tres rios valdivia whole bean coffee thru amazom . com . upon opening the first bag i noticed a difference in quality that was quite apparent . i assumed it was probably because of the different type of coffee , and only after opening the second bag did i think of looking for a freshness date on the packaging . now i ordered this coffee on july 30 and received it on august 3rd but the package has a freshness date of jun 12 ( lot # 11173407 ) . so it appears as if amazon shipped me coffee that was way out of date . i know my local grocery store is not going to sell food that is out of date so why is amazon doing it ? second entry ( 8 / 25 / 11 ) having spoken to a customer service rep at amazon , i have been told my out - of - date product will be replaced at no cost . i appreciate this and must commend amazon for their responsiveness to my complaint . 
=================
bonus : bag of sunflower nuts also contained a giant , dead beetle if you enjoy a side of dead , salted beetle with your sunflower nuts , this is the product for you . i opened a bag this morning , and after eating a few handfuls , noticed that an insect leg had been uncovered . this was shortly followed by the remaining 2 . 5 " of beetle . needless to say , i'd avoid ordering this product at all costs , and if you have , throw away whatever you haven't eaten . if i could post a picture with the review , i would . 
=================
no sleep for you ! the flavor was pretty good , but it wasn't terribly strong . i almost wanted there to be bubbles . as for the energy , i couldn't sleep hours later after drinking this . i was wide awake until the wee hour of the morning . no drinking this stuff after 10am . 
=================
tasteless . . . . . i use to like this olive oil - i've been buying it from costco for the last 10 years - and used to think it's great oil ( i still buy it sometime , just because i cannot always find my other favorite ones ) , until i tried another middle eastern variety ( from greece , especially lebanon ) . wow , what a difference . this berio oil is like just a colored water , tasteless , odorless . it's basically a colored water as any italian olive oil , even the bertolli brand which is more expensive . italian olive oil are expensive , but in my opinion they are much less in quality than their other middle eastern counterpart . if you like the real aroma and the strong taste of olive oil , you should try either a greek or lebanese . i doubt anybody will be able to try the lebanese ( the best ) variety because it's so expensive and rare , and people over there keep it for themselves . but the greek oil is much more available , affordable in price , and much better than any italian one . just google olive oil and you will seeeveryone taste is different . . . . . . . . 
=================
you have to know the product to get it right ! i'm writing this review to provide other interested customers with a more realistic expectation than the other review listed with this product does . . . the first time i've tried the tea forte green mango peach tea was via one of their silken infusers . i loved the flavor of it , i didn't even notice at that point that there was any mint included with it . when i received the loose leaf tea i ran into the same issue the other buyer did : the tea had a strong mint flavor overpowering almost all other flavors in this tea . i went ahead and used much less tea leafs ( i have one of their 12oz kati tumblers and used just 1 tsp of tea leafs with that ) and only left the leafs in the hot water for a minute or two . with that i was able to get the desired flavor . i can see how someone , that hasn't used the silken infuser and therefore has no idea what this tea is supposed to taste like , would be disappointed with this product . if you use the method of brewing i've described you barely taste any mint flavor and the mango and peach flavors come out as intended / desired . 
=================
love the flavor damage to cups un - acceptable love the flavor of these cappuccino cups they are the right level of sweet for my particular tastethat being said the number of damaged cups was un - acceptable it must have been something before boxing because the box the cups come in had no damage at all but 5 of the cups were smashed beyond recognition with the foil ripped and the sides of the some of the cups perforated that's over 20 % damaged and useless ! i really wish quality control had caught this and i could give it a higher review but with the expense of k cups already having to throw 20 % out is not a good thing
=================
hard to eat they are very pretty - look like real pearls . but they are very hard and i'm afraid to use them on my cupcakes . don't want anyone to break a tooth on these ! seller was prompt , and the photo is exact .

r w garcia is crumby ! this item came highly recommended for someone who is pre - diabetic in need of a low carb healthy snack . this snack is about $ 4 . 25 for ten ounces in stores . when i found them for $ 2 . 82 a bag when you purchase a case of 12 i went for it . the taste is great however about a forth of each bag is crumbs . i got a pound of crumbs total out of three bags . whether this is from shipping or manufacturing i don't know . i won't purchase on line again . 
=================
great taste , weird smell . the flavor is awesome but the smell is awful . i hate putting it up to my face to drink it ! i would probably not suggest this to anyone , i am kinda bummed that i bought it now . scent is half of what taste is based on and this is a brutal smell for something that tastes so nice . no bueno , lipton .

sweetleaf liquid stevia changed something about 6 mos ago ? my wife and i have been purchasing and using sweetleaf liquid stevia for approx 3 years ( auto - purchase the 2 - pack , 4 oz bottles , monthly ) . until recently , it was marketed in brown bottles and the liquid was crystal clear . about 6 mos ago the packaging changed to green bottles and from the very first shipment , there was a white suspension and white mucus around inside of cap and rim of the bottle . that said , we still use it ; have not noticed any change in concentration ( still use 5 to 6 drops equivalency to 1 teaspoon of sugar ) . it has not been watered down and we have not seen black suspension or mold as other reviewers have indicated . and , we've not noticed any symptoms one might expect if the congealed substance was anything toxic . our guess is that some of the stevia extract is congealing due to a manufacturing process change . hopefully , wisdom natural brands , the manufacturer , will rectify this and return it to it's crystal clear liquid . until then , we're still using the liquid , ignoring the suspension and enjoying the 'sweet' life . if you really can't handle the current product , check out now brands stevia . it's priced about the same and , while we haven't tried it recently , it's probably still crystal clear . hope this helps . 
=================
more fiber it took a couple of days for my dogs to convince themselves that this was ok to eat , but then that happens anytime you change food . i purchased the product due to its high fiber content to try and relieve the dragging of the butt on carpet syndrome . it is too early to tell if successful but it is apparent that their bms appear to be easier , quicker , and a lighter color and i'm still mixing the nutrisca w / their old food 50 / 50 . i believe this will be a great product for my dogs' digestive health . so , to amend my previous review , yes it does have more fiber but my dogs refuse to eat it so i guess i have to rate it lower than my original review . 
=================
taste is subjective , especially with different teas i recently started to drink 2 or more cups of both the red and the green varieties of davidson's rooibos teas . personally , i like the tastes of both varieties and enjoy drinking the tea , regardless of any consideration of potential health benefits . for me , the tea requires no additives , which are found in other brands and / or used by other consumers . but taste is such a personal , subjective thing and it is understandable why the amazon reviews for this product contain such diverse opinions in this regard . my suggestion is to try the pure form before you make a decision based solely on these reviews to see if you like it or not . 
=================
i was wrong . . . forget my review ! i made a mistake ! order was fine . cut me some slack , i have ms . . . i am sorry !

did not work for me - cat i wanted to try this product as some unknown critter keeps going into the mulch around my fruit trees and strews the mulch into the lawn . every few days i have to take a rake to repair . i think it is a cat as there is a feral cat in the neighborhood that likes to have romantic trysts on the fence waking me at night . i applied on a sunny day as directed and within two days my mulch was disturbed . we had not had any rain although the yard does have a sprinkler system . i personally believe this product would do best in warm areas as the heat makes the included peppers more pungent .

different taste this was my favorite flavor of the torani sf syrups , but i agree with other reviewers , the taste has changed . and i also agree - not in a good way . 
=================
not minced , this is ground beef although this seems like a great product it is definitely not minced . the cans say it is minced but it isn't , it is ground beef . my cat only likes minced . not chunks , not ground . although she will eat ground cat food sometimes , it has to be inviting and delicious , yet she just walks away from this . i hate it when the packaging lies about the contents of a product . the shipping was speedy and the value is great ( as long as they deliver what the promise ) now i am stuck with food my cat wont eat at all .

now only mildly spicy planters has reformulated these peanuts to greatly reduce there hotness and spiciness . in amazon's product image above , the peanuts appear thoroughly coated in chili pepper ; but , in the image i uploaded , you'll see that the peanuts now only have a light dusting of pepper and salt . so , be advised , before spending a fairly substantial amount for 108 packs of these peanuts , you should first buy a smaller quantity - - because they may not be what you expected .

i was missing one of the three cans i ordered . i e - mailed customer service and told them my problem and they wrote back telling me they could not ship just one can and they would ship me three more and i could return the two i had gotten . they then said to go to a site and print a return label which the site would not let me do as none of the items i bought on that order were returnable . they then asked me to tell them whether or not their answer solved my problem , i checked " no " and have never heard from them again on the subject .

good strong cup - o - joe first , let me say , i do not consider myself to be a coffee connoisseur or snob . i do not have a refined pallet . but , i do enjoy a good strong cup of coffee . the emerils bold is exactly what i was looking for . i know there are always those out there that say , " nowhere close to my custom grind and french press . " but , i use the keurig for the convenience and variety . the emerils bold is perfect for what i want - a good strong cup of coffee to start off my work day . * * * * * * * * * * * update 7 / 26 / 12i've tried a couple other " bold " coffee's , just to compare . ( brooklyn beanery fugettaboutit and jet fuel ) not all bolds are the same . the other bolds seemed more bitter . ( some people think that bitter = strong coffee . not true , strong coffee = good coffee , bitter coffee = bad coffee . ) i'm done experimenting with different brands . for a good , strong cup of coffee , emeril's big easy bold will be my go to coffee from now on . also , i just want to make one more comment on defective k - cups . i see alot of reviews for both emeril's and other k - cups saying saying that they are horrible because 1 in every 3 explode in their keurig machine . my wife and i go through 60 - 70 k - cups per month , since december 2011 . we've never had a problem with any of them . ( when i say 60 - 70 , they're not all emeril's bold - we would be bouncing off the walls . we also use caribou breakfast blend , decaf , green tea , heral tea , and hot cocoa . )

coco ichibanya i bought this curry because i heard it tasted just like coco's curry ( coco ichibanya is a curry house in okinawa japan ) and i was not disappointed . very delicious . i just wish it was hotter . 
=================
the only one i avoid . well , i guess i'm the fly in this reviewer ointment , but dave's is the only hotsauce that i won't buy . it has a synthetic quality to it and a flavor that is almost non - existent . this is due to its being made directly from capsaicin extract as opposed to actual peppers . it offers a nuclear level of heat that seems to be a recipe for ulcers in my opinion . according to wikipedia , its scoville heat ( fire ) index rates out 50 , 000 units which can be contrasted with tobasco's 2 , 500 to 5 , 000 rating . who needs that much heat ? not me or most human beings . this stuff is lethal . no thanks .

my dogs liked them but . . . . . . . judging by the list of junk food ingredients i wouldn't give them enough to even try to see a difference in their dental health . but my dogs are raw fed and very picky about any grain based " treats " and they gobbled these down in a heartbeat . they're a good snack but i wouldn't rely on them for any kind of dental health and they certainly are no substitute for brushing their teeth .

milo kitchen chicken meatballs - great treats for training just got a bag of these for my two shepherd dogs for training treats . i chopped them into smaller pieces to feed as rewards . my dogs' enthusiasm greatly increased after they tasted these new treats . i took these meatballs to my dogs' agility classes . many of the dogs belonging to other people were very interested in what was in my waist treat pouch . so , i ended up passing out meatballs to other people in the class for their dogs . many of the dogs had become somewhat tired in the heat of the day . after their people gave them bits of the milo chicken meatballs treats , suddenly they all perked up and seemed to have renewed energy . so i am saying each of my dogs give this a " two paws up " and it seems the others in their classes agreed . i normally only buy food or treats without artificial ingredients , fillers , preservatives , or nitrates . there is a preservative , bha , a synthetic antioxidant . it is used as a preservative for fats and oils in many foods containing meat and fish . good news is they are made in the u . s .

tastes great but gas i am laughing while writing this . you would not believe the sounds coming from my body today after eating one of these for breakfast ! i feel i could float away , i have so much gas in me ! they taste delicious ! but this is one heck of a side effect ! i've never tooted for 30 seconds straight before so it's quite amusing , but i won't be eating another one . i think i'll give the rest to people as gag gifts . 
=================
great blueberry taste but not a favorite of mine i love granola and i love kind products but the vanilla blueberry clusters were not a favorite of mine . the blueberry flavor was great . tasted like fresh blueberries but the vanilla taste was a little off and the granola itself tasted a little stale . it didn't have a balanced flavor either . i was either hit with blueberry , vanilla or oats . the flavors competed instead of complimenting . 
=================
shipping love this bread but maybe it's not something that should be shipped . i received the 12 packages and every pkg was mostly in crumbs . i was able to salvage a part of each slice . also maybe it was too warm to be shipping .

cinnamon and ginger together altoids mints , ginger , 1 . 76 - ounce tins ( pack of 12 ) altoids mints , cinnamon , 1 . 76 - ounce tins ( pack of 12 ) i enjoy ginger altoids and cinnamon altoids together . the strong spice flavors augment and complement each other perfectly . beware ! they are not for the weak of heart or weak of palate .

worse than even tab , tastes like battery acid i don't know how any human being can consume stuff like this and tab . its like drinking battery acid . this stuff will eat the lining of your stomach in a matter of a few years . you'd have to be nutty to drink this stuff . apparantly this stuff is a big hit with retired servicemen in germany , as sales of diet rite have increased 3000 % in some german provinces lately . in fact , upon fears of hoarding of diet rite , the german government recently raided a house of a retired american serviceman named mikey and found him sitting in his basement , nude , amidst hundreds of cases of diet rite cola , boxes and boxes of zagnut candy bars , watching terrible second rate movies about time travel and german fisting porn . that is some wild and wacky stuff .

inedible chemical flavor . our guests unanimously agreed . we purchased a three pack of chocolate caramel , strawberry vanilla , and lemon poppyseed because the package looked so attractive , and i thought it would save me some time . the flavors sounded very appealing . reality couldn't be farther removed from the picture . the cupcakes were practically inedible . the chemical flavor of the additives was unbearable . i actually spit out the first bite i took of the chocolate caramel . i asked several guests to try a bite of all three flavors ( because i wondered if there was something wrong with me . couldn't imagine three flavors of such an attractive looking mix could be that gross ) , and not a single person liked them . i ended up throwing everything away , and having to buy something else in a hurry . furthermore , i'm not someone who likes much frosting on cupcakes , but the package provided barely made enough to thinly cover the cupcakes . very thinly . if you were to put as much frosting on your cupcake as is shown in the picture , about a third of your frosting would already be used up . this is probably a good thing , since the frosting had that horrible quality of coating the roof of your mouth in a layer of revolting grease that is hard to get rid of . ( and i used strictly fresh ingredients that i had just bought , added according to the recipe . ) what a waste of three packages of cupcake mix and fresh ingredients ! ! 
=================
very small bag but good cookies ! i love these cookies . the package was very small . i would say the bag of cookies was the size of the palm of my hand ( petite lady ) . so , for the size and price i would not buy this size again for this price . but overall again , the product is yummy !

taste nirvana vs other coconut water i was born and raise in vietnam so i have drunk coconut juice my entire life . i guess that makes me somewhat credible because i can tell if this tastes like the real thing or not . so last week i had a craving for coconut water so i decided to hit up the local supermarket and tried a few brands including taste nirvana , sunvoi , kimbo , and laguna * * * all made in thailand * * * . taste nirvana was sold at ralphs for $ 2 . 90 and the other 3 were at asian supermarket @ $ . 99 / ea . so why did i dish out $ 2 . 90 for this can ? because i was simply doing a taste test so i didn't bother ordering from amazon . let's move on with the comparisontaste nirvana : 2 . 5 / 5pro : - eye catching design on the can - probably healthycon : - bland , lacking in taste - expensive unless you buy from amazon * but watch out for the horrible packaging * kimbo : 3 . 5 / 5pro : - cheap ( 16 . 2 oz for only 99 cent ) - tastes pretty damn good surprisinglycon : - cheap looking design just like amy & brian coconut - not available in non - asian supermarketssunvoi 1 / 5pro : - cheapcon : - forgettable taste - not sold in us supermarket ( though this is really a pro ) laguna : 0 / 5pro : ? ? ? con : - sugar filled water - being sold in supermarket - probly gives you disease if you drink the whole can

won't makes cats sick , gives them shiny coats . cats are like children ; they will pick the tasty junk that makes them throw up over the tasteless good stuff that makes their coats shiny . they refuse to eat any wet canned flavor of this brand , much like a child will refuse to eat brussels sprouts . unfortunately unlike children you can't force - feed or bribe a cat . cats , fortunately , are not as picky about cereal as they are wet food . this is on par with wellness dry food , but had the benefit of not crumbling into powder . we feed ours this cereal with wet food from wellness & natural balance . remember ; cats are carnivores ; they cannot digest corn , wheat , tapioca , fruit , or vegetables ( except seaweed & grass ) ; all of that stuff is filler that just makes them poop more & has negative effects on their digestive tracts . 
=================
good taste , but full of shell pieces i ordered two boxes , one each of the almond coconut and date walnut . tasted decent enough but both are chock full o' nut shells . i took some walnut shell shrapnel to the the gum line and my wife pulled it out with a pair of hemostats . it was almost 1 / 8th " long and looked like a sabre tooth fang . can't take any more chances on the rest . chew with extreme prejudice .

they don't like it , but they eat it my cats aren't very fond of the taste . it took forever to get them to switch to this food . when i give them this , they leave it in the bowl and pick at it all day . if i give them their old food , they'll eat all of it within half an hour . perhaps that's better , and will help keep their weight down . i did not notice a difference in their coat or the smell of their litter box . there was two or three weeks of vomiting before fully switching over though . which was gross to say the least . i have found that my cats eat much much less than the recommended amount on the bag . took one star off because they only tolerate it . 
=================
it's ok , but it's no cadbury just personal taste but this tastes too plain sweet , not chocolaty enough . reminds me very much of cheap easter bunny chocolate . if you like your chocolate really rich , and more chocolate than sugar , cadbury dairy milk is the best . 
=================
marukome green onion miso soup is one of those aquired tastes i'm trying to aquire . though more usually ends up in the toilet than in my stomach , this stuff wasn't too bad . i finished the whole bowl . maybe i added too much water because there wasn't any extreme salty taste . it would be a good soup for the miso - phobe to try . 
=================
stinkier than cadet bully sticks our dog loooooves bully sticks , and they are great for keeping him occupied when we need to get work done around the house . these bully sticks seem to be high quality and last as long as other brands . all bully sticks are pretty stinky , however we thought these sticks were stinkier than our usual brand cadet . the cadet brand sticks all smell the same stinky way - however , some of these sticks smelled like regular bully sticks and some smelled like poop . yes poop . more than once i had to do a shoe - check to see if i stepped in some doo , but nope - no doo , just these sticks . i guess we would purchase these again if they were considerably less expensive than cadet , but otherwise , we probably wouldn't . . . . not because they aren't decent sticks . . . but because they are extra stinky . 
=================
maggots with powder i loved the flavor of the vanilla shakes until one of my packages had dry maggots in it , which makes me be seriously concerned about the cleanliness of the facility that packed the protein powder - - or about the origin of the protein in the pack . would give labrada negative stars if i could . 
=================
2 dogs vote it thumbs up my two dogs prefer the wingaling over the other varieties of this dog food . there are actual wings ( usually 2 ) packed into the can along with other meat chunks , veggies and liquid . there is a bit more liquid than i would like but my dogs eat it , it doesn't go to waste and you can see that " real " meat is used .

editing review . . . again the first time i purchased from them , i was very disappointed in the method . i was apprehensive about placing due to the fact that i was writing a card online and i wasn't sure it'd get picked up . it didn't , and the receiver got the beautiful flowers and spent all day trying to figure out who they were from . she called the company and they said the note was " deliberately " left blank which is not true at all . i was left loving the flowers but not happy with the method or seller . that being said , i was contacted by the company and i now give them a 5 star rating for their efforts in making my experience better . i would absolutely , positively order from them again . and i appreciate them contacting me . i have placed another order and will continue to do so . thank you pro flowers @ amazon ! update . . . 3 / 15 / 12they did indeed place another order for me , which was delivered on tuesday as planned . and guess what ? the receiver called me , after calling a handful of others , because again . . . the card message did not get delivered . i will not be using them again . 
=================
what is that smell ? ? true , the beans were huge , moist and plump , with a good mixture of really big fat ones and smaller skinny ones . however , the most noticeable aroma coming from the bag and the beans is best described as pungent , with a side of sour . is that normal ? ! ? i've only ever used the crappy dried out grocery store version , and was thrilled when i saw such a good deal on these . can a vanilla bean expert tell me if that odd , unpleasant aroma is what i'm supposed to be smelling ? ? 
=================
no lasting power i tried this litter at the suggestion on someone's suggestion in the grocery . it lasted a long time for him and his multi - cat household and locked in all the odors . unfortunately , it didn't work well for me . kitty didn't mind it and there was no dust flying up when i scooped out the stinky solids and fluffed the litter ( huge plus ) , but if i didn't change it every 5 - 7 days , the yellow - soaked grains would start to smell stale and then downright stinky . the stuff costs too much for that . i tried fresh step extreme instead and that stuff is amazing . of course , i have to contend with the dust , but again , kitty doesn't mind it and it smells fresh and masks the odors of the waste as i remove it . i only change it once every 3 - 4 weeks , but i do clean her box everytime she uses it . 
=================
zero'd out with all of the buzz about artificial sweeteners , i am open to finding an alternative to splenda . i indulge in an occasional diet coke , but have been looking for something to sweeten coffee in the cooler weather and my iced green tea or iced coffee in the warmer months . i brewed a gallon of green tea and chilled it . since some guests prefer sugar or unsweetened , i normally add sweetener when i pour a glass of tea . the first time , i poured it in a see - thru sport bottle to tote along with me during the day . i added some " zero " . it didn't dissolve . i stirred . still didn't dissolve . i let it sit for a while , still didn't dissolve . tried sipping it - all of the " zero " was still at the bottom . shook ferociously . left on counter for hours , thinking room temp would help . ( nope ) five days later , the " zero " in the see - thru sport bottle , still hadn't dissolved . i eventually poured it out . ( as an odd note : it left a white film on the lip of the bottle opening . ) so i brewed a 1 / 2 gallon of green tea and added some " zero " to it while it was still warm . it dissolved . then i put in fridge to cool . poured a glass - i used a generous amount of " zero " - but the level of sweetness was marginal . i'll wait until cooler weather and give it a shot for sweetening my coffee , but i find it to be a poor performing and pricey useless product . 
=================
on the strong side the flavors of these are a bit on the strong side . wish i hadn't bought so many . . . i thought i would love them since parmesan and garlic are two of my favorite flavors . oh well . . .

they increased the price ! ! it use to be 4 boxes of special k red berries cereal , 16 . 7 ounce box for $ 11 - 13 . now it's 3 boxes for $ 14 - 15 ! outrageous ! ! ~ _ ~ ! ! now this isnt any cheaper than the stores .

old drrrrrrrrrrrry beans when coffee was being ground i could tell the beans were old and dried out , not a good flavor or or even much of any flavor at all , save your money on this company . call company and they made restitution .

on the fence about this product i tired it for the first time yesterday . i bought the blue raz flavor . it is really awful tasting . i felt a rush right after drinking it and within 20 min had to run to the bathroom because it really upset my stomach . i will try in a few more times but i am honestly on the fench . 
=================
the cat's meow all four of my cats loved this canned cat food ! the food in each can really looked and smelled as if a human being could eat the food . the seasame chicken entree and chicken pot pie entree were both very popular with my cats . neither flavor smelled bad . the chicken pot pie entree was kind of runny , but my cats really enjoyed lapping up the juice . i've feed my cats a few cans of each flavor , and none of them have got the diarrhea from the food . their stomachs seem to tolerate the food quite well . i've had probelms in the past with canned cat food causing stomach and other digestive problems for my cats . according to the can's list of ingredients , all the ingredients are natural - no by - products are used . while the food is not organic , at least the food doesn't use by - products . no wheat gluten is used either . i went to the company's website and found that the company uses only dolphin safe tuna and does not use any child labor . none of the ingredients come from china , which has a horrible record on food safety . the cat food is made in thailand , but as far as i know , thailand does not have a poor record of food safety , and thai people do love their pet cats , i sure thai pet owners would not want to harm their cats with poor quality pet food . i personally see nothing to fear from thai cat food . i think i will be ordering more petite cusine in the future and would not hestitate recommending this food to my cat loving friends . 
=================
way too much $ $ $ $ unless you are in dire , immediate need for this , i would not recommend buying this particular item here . i literally just happened to buy this in my local stop & shop grocery store for $ 2 . 99 . yes , i triple - checked and it's the exact same item and size - 4 . 4 lbs . the product is good but the price is terrible ! 
=================
not bad . . . but it's mostly just granola . . . i expected more when i saw this yummy sounding chocolate granola , i thought it sounded great ! well , it is just that , chocolate granola that is ! nothing fancy , but it's still tasty . i guess i was disappointed nonetheless though . . . i was expecting a bit more creativity i suppose . 
=================
a much - missed favorite . a few years ago , my cats and i relocated to germany . and while my four - pawed trio generally took the move in stride and quickly adapted to their new home in a manner that filled me with new love and admiration for them , there is one item now , several years later , still sorely lacking in their lives : pounce tuna treats ! for as long as we've been together ( and in the case of the two females , that means their entire life ) , there has never been a better way to reward them or just show them my affection than by giving them some of these - my cats loved them , and i knew that due to the treats' many healthy ingredients i was actually doing something good for my kitties in addition to making them happy . but pounce is nowhere to be found on the shelves of german stores ! my cats are not overly picky in their food choices ; they willingly accept almost everything appearing in their food bowls . but they have made it quite clear to me that a decent substitute for pounce is yet to be discovered . in the meantime , what's a poor cat owner to do ? ? ? 
=================
think thin bars these bars are shipped via the u . s . post office . when i buy them in a store such as whole foods , they are fresh and the outer coatings intact . when i bought them through amazon , the outer coatings were melted and in some cases stuck to the inside of the wrappers . it is not a case where they were left in a mailbox all day . my mailman handed them to me , along with the other mail . don't buy this product from amazon , pay a little more and get a good product . 
=================
note that wheat - free does not equal gluten - free nana's no wheat - no refined sugar - chocolate chip cookie , 3 . 5 - ounce packages ( pack of 12 ) i have tried several of nana's products and they are very , very tasty for the occasional snack or special occasion . with my gluten - free diet ( and expecting family members with dietary restrictions ) , i ordered a box of these renowned chocolate chip cookies for inclusion on the dessert table at my son's graduation bbq . please note : these " no wheat " cookies do contain gluten - - in the form of barley flour and malted barley . in my ignorance , i excitedly purchased these without carefully reading the ingredients . why would these cookies be advertised as being free of wheat , sugar and dairy , and yet , contaminated with barley ? ? ? yes , they are , indeed " wheat - free " . . . if someone can explain this , i would love to hear the explanation . consume these with caution . 
=================
this review is actually written by my dogs ! these treats are great ! they're yummy ! they have such a perfect consistency , not too hard , not soft at all . they don't get gummy when they're chewed for awhile so mom doesn't mind picking them up after they've been chewed on for a bit . sometimes she has to do that 'cause we get obsessed with chewing them on occasion and we just won't put them down ! ( ok , i admit , that's me . . . " banshee " . i am a himalayolic but i don't need help . i just need more himalayan dog chews and mom found them at amazon . com for the best price anywhere ! ) these treats are hard and crunchy and stay that way , they only get a tiny hint of softness as chewed . we have to work at it but small pieces flake off and we get our tasty reward ! they make great dental bones because they have more flavor and have stiff edges to help rub along our teeth and break off the tarter . oh , and they don't have the foul odor of hoof chewies or some others . mom and dad gag when we chew hoofies but they love the himalayan chews . did i say they are great ? well i meant they are outstanding ! they are wonderful and all three of us love them so much that on occasion we have fought over them . that's because " zac " likes to horde them and tries to hide them all . he's stopped that now since mom worked with him . that's great because now she can leave 4 - 5 out , ( more than the number of dogs is smart ) , without worry of a fight . one warning is that you should watch your dog as they get down near the end of the chew . " li " is a real aggressive eater and when he gets to that last inch he'll swallow it whole ! one of these times i'm worried it may get stuck in his intestine and require surgery since i'm uncertain how well a large chunk will be digested . regular chunks appear to be fully digested since it never hurts going poddy and mom never complains about chunks in our poops , bol ( bark out loud ) . we've been receiving these fine treats since they first came on the market and we've had no trouble . we ( mostly ) are average to above average chewers with lots of experience with these chews and we'd recommend you try them with your dogs . like any chew , you should stick around and observe us as we chew but for light to moderate chewers you might be watching for hours and even then we may not finish one since it's highly dependent on the aggressiveness of the chewer . crazy mad chewers like " li " have been known to bite down on even the large ones and snap it in two , which is great 'cause then i get another one ! our mom watches us well and picks the chews up when she cannot watch us . i think that's smart for all chews . now , go on ! what are you waiting for ? go buy some for " max " and " hannah " ! 
=================
this order never came i've used the product before and love it but there is just one problem . . . . the order never came and i ordered it a month and half ago . i think i would do better ordering it from some where else . however i gave the product two stars because the product itself is good . it would have been five if i had recieved the product . 
=================
kix + rice crispies + corn flakes + sugar + vanilla this cereal looks like someone mixed together kix , rice crispies , and corn flakes . it tastes like they did that , then added sugar and some vanilla . i found it to be both very sweet ( the second ingredient is sugar ) and not very filling . it turned to mush within about five minutes , too , so unless you're a power - eater , it'll be soggy goop by the end of the bowl . i know that 'contents may settle' , but the bag inside the box was only half full , which seemed a bit laughable . based on what i poured in my cereal bowl , which i admit is far larger than the 'serving size' of 2 / 3 of a cup , each box contains about four breakfasts . if , however , you only eat 2 / 3 of a cup of cereal each morning , the box will last you much longer . ( the ridiculously small serving size also explains why a cereal that tastes like it's mostly sugar only has 7 grams of sugar per serving . ) there are precious few gluten - free cereals on shelves , but there has to be at least one that's better than this . 
=================
no more chewing on my slippers ! i have two dogs who love these things so much ! they prefer the chocolate one to the chicken ones so i may have to buy another pack . 
=================
ancient harvest quinoa rotelle this pasta cooks up and tastes very much like wheat pasta . the taste is very good . i only wish i had been able to read , or explored the ingredient list further . even on the front of the box , that little white tag inset on the upper left green panel , says , " corn - quinoa " blend . so if corn is not a problem for you , it should be fine . going form wheat to corn flower is not a move in a positive direction , in my mind . it is gluten free , so if that is your main objective , this product satisfies . 
=================
taco bell jalapeno sauce very very mild jalapeno flavor . you have to work hard to pick up the flavor of the jalapeno . the sauce has a creamy salad dressing thickness to it and overall this is a very neutral flavor . it's not bad , but it's not good enough to recommend . it definitely needed more jalapeno snap to it . 
=================
far from our favorite snack i feed my baby earth's best baby food so i figured i would try some snacks that they make . i have had other flavors of the crunchin blocks and like them . however the honey ones are absolutely terrible . the first box i got tasted like chemicals so amazon . com sent me a replacement . it doesn't taste much better than the first to me . my son is not crazy about them either which says a lot because he loves his snacks ! would not buy these again . 
=================
tasty - but small and not lasting the quality of this bone has left me disappointed . it is also smaller than advertised , only about 12 inches . this is the second bone of this type that i have purchased . i will exclude the brand name of the first because i cannot remember it . it's been that long since it was purchased . granted , i bought that bone when the dog was still teething , it has lasted for close to 10 months now . at one point , i sawed it in half and gave a piece to my sister's dog because she loves it . my point is that the previous bone has withstood much more heavy chewing than the smokehouse brand . it arrived not even 36 hours ago , my dog chewing on it for about 3 of those hours , and she has already worked off one of the ball joint ends ( about 3 - 4 inches ) . she's a pitbull mix and she is just shredding through this thing . i should add that it has not made her sick and she does enjoy it greatly . however , if you are under the impression that this bone will last for a while , you will be disappointed . 
=================
consistent good performing seeds i bought these last year and they performed equally well . highly recommended . i bought lavender seeds from several companies this year . here are the results : very satisfied with these two brands . . . botanical interests' french 'purple ribbon' lavender : these seeds sprang up two days after planting . i was pretty amazed . renee's english lavender : was the second lot to spring up a few days after botanical interests' . consistently good . poorest . . . lavender seeds french perfume : one plant has shown . and one grass blade . this company sent 10 seeds in their big fancy packet . ten . other companies send much more than this . with a 90 % failure rate , i would not recommend this company . hinterland trading co . blue lavender : nothing . not a single seed has shown up yet . not even a 'hinter' of any of them coming either . i definitely would not recommend this company . hope this helps others looking for lavender seeds . 
=================
way overpriced i absolutely love this cat food . since my cats have been on it the change in their coats is remarkable . they also leave way less solids in the cat box since there is no corn in it . it is great for cats with urinary tract issues as well . my complaint is the price they have listed . . . . ridiculous ! at a local pet store i pay $ 35 for the 12 pound bag and even petco , which is listed in the ad has it cheaper . 
=================
5 times the price = 1 / 5 rating this excellent tea comes from the uk where it costs about $ 3 ( 50 bags ) at supermarkets . a few purchases like this ( $ 19 including shipping ? ? ) may well add up to a ticket to london . fortunately , the leaf version of the same tea is available at a decent price from amazon . 
=================
natural flavoring added i purchased these as a healthy choice . i'm concerned about the last ingredient " natural flavoring . " i don't need natural flavoring on my nuts . i wouldn't have purchased them if i had known this prior to making the purchase . initially i was thinking that these were the most delicous nuts on earth now i know why , they are altered by something they call natural . there's no phone number on the container ? but there is an email address . i will update this after i hear from them .

chocolate a 5 , but customer service a 0 when i lived in wisconsin , i was a big fan of this choc . after moving overseas , i sent emails to the company asking about how to get it , or even act as exporter for it ! but answer came there none ( to borrow a lewis carroll phrase . ) such a pity .

not bad . . . . these are super sugary though . not caked with it on them , but ultra sweet and i'm not talking fruit sweet . i'm talking syrupy or sugar sweet . they came very fast and i ordered a few items form this vendor and even though every item said around 8 bucks shipping it wasn't 8 bucks per item . they charged only 8 bucks for 4 items . i would buy again . these aren't for super natural dried fruit lovers . they are closer to candy , not that they aren't dried fruit , but because they are super sweet from the corn syrup added . 
=================
no more stale chips . cheap ! mine came with stickers to sell them for $ 1 . 59 but they cost more like $ 1 . 25 so if for retail that is not much of a mark up . i bought these for myself so that doesn't really matter and they are cheap . similar to lay's but cheaper . unlike other knockoffs these seemed to taste fresher and the convenient size minimizes stale chips . great product . great price .

tasty for $ 7 . 99 / lb , not for $ 9 . 99 / lb oh sweet magnum kona , you were my go - to caffeine pusher for 10 months . you taste so smooth , you smell so good , you were the best part of waking up in the way foldger's never could be . now you slip in this 25 % price hike to $ 10 / lb ? no thank you . why have you deserted me ? 
=================
ridiculously expensive . . . . . . . . but what can you do . $ 10 bucks for 4 ounces is ridiculous , but if you need it , and cant get it locally , what choice do you have ? needed it for smoking and curing salmon filets so it worked . but i'm going to have to find a different recipe for smoking and curing . i just cant afford these prices in the future . if it was 80z or 120z , i could swallow that . . . . . . . . . . . but even filet mignon isn't this expensive .

cheesecake may spoil during delivery i got a 6 month cheesecake order as a gift , and the first cheeesecake arrived packed in dry ice . it was frozen and tasted great after a night in the fridge . the second cheesecake arrived spoiled . they did not ensure rapid delivery of the cake and the dry ice melted while the cake was in transit . when i called the company and asked for a replacement , they said that would be impossible , and that i would have to pick another product . i asked to speak to a manager and the manager acted like it was my fault that the cake spoiled in transit , and said i was lucky that they were willing to give me anything . i've ordered other month clubs from other companies in the past , and never once had an item spoil prior to delivery . and on the very rare occasion a product arrived damaged , other companies were very willing to make it up to me . amazing clubs made it very clear they had no interest in customer satisfaction .

pumpkin spice , emphasis on the spice i bought this syrup because my partner loves everything pumpkin . i thought i'd try it out to make pumpkin lattes and potentially use it to flavor other things . however , when tasted it , i was overwhelmed by cinnamon . i like cinnamon , but i felt the " spice " completely overpowered the pumpkin . just in case the flavor would mellow when combined with food i tried it in a latte . the cinnamon still predominated and my drink had such a strong aftertaste i actually couldn't finish it . to be fair , i often find pre - flavored coffees to have an undesirable aftertaste as well , but i've had good luck with various syrups and additives . . . for instance , i can't stand irish creme flavored coffee , but i quite enjoy the occasional coffee with an actual shot of irish creme . i'm not saying the syrup is of bad quality , it's just that i feel it's important to let folks know exactly what they're in for . summary : i can't really taste the pumpkin over all the spice . . . very strong presence of cinnamon . 
=================
not too bad if you have never tried durian and are curious , these freeze dried pieces don't smell too bad - - not as bad as durian jam - - but they don't taste good either . the texture of of durian is one of the nice things about it , and it's lost when dried . these taste like dried dirty old gym socks . 
=================
free of artificial dyes with no artificial dyes or colors , these lollipops are sure to please both moms and kids . they taste just like regular candy .

too pricey , but great product i buy this same product at a local store for $ 4 . 99 / 12 oz . jar . and this store is typically more expensive than other local stores , but it carries hard to find items such as almond butter . cheers !

i don't hate it last night i tried this product according to the instructions . my oven was at the right temperature , and i baked for just over 12 minutes ( around 157 degrees according to my tests ) . and i tried it with some center - cut pork chops with the bone in , which should have made the resulting dish better than if i'd chosen plain old no - bone pork chops , but 100 % of the three people who consumed these chops agreed they would have preferred them with no coating at all . one person said that the one part of her chop that i missed coating with the product on one side was the single best bite she took . another tester said she wished i had merely seared the two surfaces of the chops and left off the coating altogether . i myself appreciated the crunch of this coating , but every bite had an off flavor that i would prefer had not been there . i too would have preferred no coating at all to the coating this product added to the pork chops . in case you're interested , here's the ingredients list . enriched wheat flour ( wheat flour , niacin , iron , thiamin mononitrate ( vitamin b1 ) , riboflavin ( vitamin b2 ) , folic acid ) , salt , canola oil , sugar , spice , contains less than 2 % of caramel color , dried onions , dextrose , yeast , extractives of paprika , ascorbic acid . i think you can whip up a reasonable substitute - - except for the caramel color - - by mixing flour and ground corn meal with salt and paprika , and i'd add some pepper if i were you unless you don't want me to . why shake ? also , i'm not sure why you should bother to put the coating and the chops into a zip - top bag and shake them , especially since you must supply the bag , and especially especially since you must discard it immediately since it's coated in raw pork ick and which also adds maybe 15 cents to the price of the product . why can't you just dump the 2 . 25 ounces of coating onto a plate and dredge ? i get the bake part of shake 'n bake , but i don't get the shake part . the package says to buy four to six half - inch - thick pork chops , and i bought one for each of us three diners plus one extra for a total of - - just a moment while i whip out my spreadsheet here - - four . as you can see from the photograph i've thoughtfully added , they were pretty big chops , and there was not nearly enough coating to have done the last one , not to mention a fifth and sixth . this morning for breakfast i fried the emergency backup pork chop in a little butter but obviously with no coating , and it was much more agreeable than the coated one last night . as a result , i conclude that this product needs improvement , and i rate it two stars . i'd rate it one star , but that means that i literally hate it , which is a bit strong . i just have no immediate or even long - term plans to use it again . in case you were wondering , as i can attest from having run the experiments for you , this product does not improve the flavor or texture of tapioca , a mocha latte , or vanilla ice cream ( or probably any other flavor , but vanilla was all we had ) . - - update : i don't see where we reviewers can add photos to the product page , so i take back what i said above about " the photograph i've thoughtfully added . " maybe later . - - update of august 8 , 2011 : i've now been able to add the photo , so please stop emailing me asking when the heck i'm going to get it posted .

very small quantity , poor growth i got these dehydrated kefir grains two weeks ago . when re - hydrated there was a very tiny amount of actual grains . i put them in a jar with milk on a seedling mat to keep them the right temperature ( our house is cool at night ) and was very careful , and yet the milk kept curdling because there weren't enough grains , or just going yeasty . and they're growing very , very slowly . two weeks later and i have a half teaspoon of grains . so far the milk has never smelled anything like kefir . in desperation i started adding some kefir powder and kefir , thinking that maybe they'd pick up some missing bacteria . also , the instructions are misleading when they talk about it taking two weeks to " rehydrate " . what you're doing is growing them to the point that you have enough to actually make kefir . i'm starting to think that dehydrated grains are a bad idea . but at the very least they ought to give you enough of them , instead of the tiny amount . because it didn't seem like it was working very well , i ordered two tablespoons of live kefir grains from another vendor . they arrived yesterday , and i put them in milk . today i think i have almost a quarter cup of grains . they seem to have already grown noticeably . out of curiosity i'm still going to try to get these grains to work . i'm going to try a much smaller amount of milk so the kefir grains aren't overwhelmed . i'll update this review if it ever works . 
=================
tastes okay , but the 'end result' is not worth it . my wife originally ate one a few weeks ago and told me about how the next day she had sharp stomach pains and spent quite a bit of time in the bathroom . i didn't think much of it and i ended up buying one for myself ( admittedly by mistake , i just wanted a regular beef stick ) . they taste okay ; the spiciness is interesting that it has sort of a delay but , it does seem to stick around long after the burn starts . however , the next day i woke up out of a deep sleep from sharp pains in my stomach and had to use the bathroom twice . and the pains are very sharp , i had to keep clenching my stomach and i was rocking back and forth . i feel bad that my wife had to experience this during work ! tl ; dr : tastes okay , but the 'end result' is not worth it . . . unless you've been constipated for weeks and have grown desperate for a cure , you'll probably not want to experience the end results of this delicious beef stick . 
=================
can't recommend i have concerns with this product that would prevent me from buying . it has more calories and sugar than regular coke and was much too sweet for my taste . the strawberry flavor was not subtle but had a " bite " . all this might be ok if it tasted terrific ; however , it doesn't to me at all . it tastes sort of candyish - - or like someone carbonated strawberry jelly . and it costs almost a dollar a can . . . . 
=================
can't rate what i never got i can not rate a purchase that i never received as i find it hard to write a review for .

very mild flavor i was very excited about these blooming tea despite some bad reviews , but it was not impressive at all . flavor is very very mild , flowers do fall apart some times . i guess i can see why it's not very popular .

trappist abbey fruitcake for years i have looked for a " store - bought " fruitcake that lived up to the ones made by my mother and grandmother when i was young . this is it ! my only regret is that i didn't get to lick the bowl after they poured the batter into the pan . 
=================
looses flavor too quickly i wish the flavor would last longer . a few months ago i quit using products with artifical sweeteners , which is how i found this gum . since the flavor is gone in under a minute , i keep popping in a new piece & trash the old . i like the crunch when you first bite into it . i end up going through it way too fast and will probably try and wean myself off gum completly ( if i can ) .

sweet and savory basket i sent this as a gift . my sister , the recipient , said that the packaging was lovely , but that was the best part of the basket . the food inside was scimpy and not the quality you would expect from a gift basket . i would not send this to anyone else or purchase it for myself . 
=================
too bland , needs to be spiced up . i am all for healthy soups , but the taste of this one is far too bland . i added some sea salt , peppercorns and roasted seaweed to make it palatable . the end result is pretty good , thus the four stars , otherwise it would've gotten one .

terrible and dangerous to feed i fed canidae als ( old formula ) for 7 + years and my dogs thrived . canidae switched their formula ( and mfg ) and i immediately switched to another food afer the reported of problems . my feed store talked me into trying their 'new' formula , and i went back to als - big mistake . i have experienced 15 - 20 + % weight loss , explosive diarreha , vomitting , lethargy . etc . i have 5 dogs - 60 - 100 + lbs , varying pedigrees , ages 1 to 12 + - all sick ( 15 - 20 % weight loss , poor coats , vomitting , etc . ) . i have had to run complete extensive blood panels to rule out other health problems on all the dogs - bottomline - blood panels were ok , food ( canidae ) was the issue . what use to be a fantastic food is now a very dangerous food to feed . an entire pack of dogs' health declined on the 'new' formula . i switched foods ( something other than canidae ) and my dogs are now recovering . if you love las vegas and russian roulette feed canidae - if want to avoid major vet expenses and heartache choose another food . do your homework - research the canidae als problems - then make the best 'educated' decision for you and your pets . - - - - it's been a over a year since i originally posted review of this product , and i thought it was time for an update . i still warn folks from feeding canidae als . . . other canidae formuals i don't know . my dogs have recovered ( thank goodness ) . they are back to running the fenceline , greeting visitors , etc . - and not as sickly as they had become - aka the lethergic , diarreha , lost weight crew i was faced with . i know there are a bunch of pros and cons out there on various websites concerning canidae - and i use to be one of the biggest 'flag wavers' for canidae . . . . until the formula change and the vet expenses i was forced to face . believe me - with a very heavy heart i cannot recommend canidae any more . i do not do this with a flare of being noticed on the internet , any vindications against the company , or any personnal gain . . . just a great concern for the illnesses i've experienced with my 'pack' ( 5 + dogs ) . it took several months ( under vet care & dry dog food changes ) for my dogs to recover , and i don't want to see any other 'beloved family members' undergo what i've / we've gone through . please , please , please check out [ . . . ] ( a highly recommended ( non - bias ) dog food analysis site ) . they are still recommending canidae als as a 5 - star ( 6 star being the highest rating ) premium food to feed - with the caveate 'however , from a position of being a product about which dfa heard very few complaints , the number of animals we hear of that do not do well on this food appears to have risen substantially . 'all i ask is do your own personal research concerning this food , keep an eye on your pet's food reactions , and make the best 'educated' decision for your beloved 'four footed / furry' family members .

greenies is a treat , not a dental / oral product ! first , my cat loves this treat . however , it is definitely not a dental product as the manufacturer advertised . there is no enzyme in greenies that would promote dental health . the size of the treat is pretty standard compares to other brands of cat treats , so there is no need for the cat to chew on it ( my cat swallows it in 2 seconds ) , which means greenies does not " brush off " the tartar either . i took my cat to the vet few months ago for professional dental cleaning . after the treatment , the vet gave me some handouts about dental care for cats , and explained to me that greenies does not promote dental care . instead , the vet recommends the cet chews for cats . however , the vet says , nothing beats brushing your cat's teeth at least every other day . so , if you are looking for an oral hygiene chews , look somewhere else , however , if you just want to please your cat , greenies does make a tasty treat !

good - but very strong and not going to buy again not really our cup of tea . worth trying once , but will not be ordering again . it was interesting , but the flavor was too intense for us to find really enjoyable . at least it is caffeine free . 
=================
perhaps not for cats ? the label states this is food for dogs and cats , but my kitty gave it zero stars . i don't think he took more than one bite of the stuff . i was surprised at his blas & eacute ; reaction , as he thoroughly enjoyed the evanger's evanger's grain - free dog / cat canned food evanger's grain free 100 % rabbit dog 24 canned food i gave him . i decided to still award the product 2 stars because of the ingredients list : beef , water , liver and guar gum . 
=================
no comparison ! ! ! i've always known that european chocolate beats the pants off american chocolate , but i had no idea personally until visiting london and buying this particular candy bar . there is no comparison to american hershey's or any other brand of american chocolate i have ever found . don't kid yourself . . . if you want great chocolate , this is the way to go ! 
=================
diabetic shock ! well i give this a two star only because i read its sweetened with splenda , so shock might not really be an issue . but unless you really like eating out of the sugar bowl this is not for you . ( this coming from a person who could drink 3 cups of the tassimo hot chocolate a day ) smells wonderful , looks wonderful but my daughter ( 19 ) and i couldnt even finish a third of a cup and she ended up with a headache . why it has to be so sickening sweet is beyond me . by the way , i adore the other twinings tea . 
=================
great packaging ; fair coffee i love the way this is packaged ( other than , as others have noted , you need to keep the k - cups in a resealable bag , so they're not quite as convenient as traditional k - cups in terms of storage ) . but the coffee is only so - so . had several others try it , and they were not impressed , either - - they liked the packages but didn't like the coffee . 
=================
not for the squeemish . i like this brand of ramen . they make authentic flavors and they are made in the us . while i like seafood i was a bit taken aback my the chunks of dehydrated tuna and anchovy in this soup . i think i'll stick with their spicy kimchi which is awesome
=================
soup that i wished i had tasted ! i have not had a chance to try this soup . when it arrived , all the packages , all 4 of them , were torn open and there is no way that i can seperate the contents to make the soup . it sounds delicious , but i have no way of knowing . i wish the people who make this product would send me another to try at their expense and sealed in a better way . actually , i have no real true way to give it any stars as much as i would like to .

european style orange this is not like orange crush . it is less sweet and more refreshing , like the european orangades or orangina , and i adore it !

may have caused hives i say the food " may " have caused hives because i cannot be sure it was related to this food but it definitely could have been . . . my 9 month female boxer first started with tiny bumps which got worse over a period of 3 weeks . not long after our larger male boxer puppy started getting large red hives on his face also . the only thing different about their diet was this food . at first we did not think this was from the food ( they were on it 2 weeks before any symptoms ) and tried every other avenue to locate the cause of the hives , bug bits , fleas , recently washed bedding etc . . . after looking to every other area for the cause and the hives only getting worse and worse we stopped feeding them this food altogether . it has only been 2 days since we switched them over to a natural balance l . i . t . allergy formula and so far the hives have stopped from getting any worse . its still too soon to say for sure this was the cause but at least the hives seem to be slowing !

ok flavor , too much like bacon bits ok flavor , tasted too much like bacon bits . i got it on sale and an extra $ 10 off . that made it worth it . regular price is way too high
=================
not very delicious but effective took some getting used to - - at first i joked that it tasted like a liquid crouton . after a while , though , you get used to the taste . took it for health reasons . . . whether it was the tea or something else , the issue went away . definitely not something i'd drink every day but if necessary , it's tolerable . note : putting honey in it makes it worse . and hot is preferable to iced . 
=================
something you can't un - taste , if your a man or animal you can't un - taste this goup . the reviewers who said this stuff has the consistency of frosting are right , but it doesn't taste like frosting . here is a true story that pretty much sums up this product : my sister's dog loves to eat everything , especially peanut butter . i swear , her dog takes one sniff of this stuff and runs the other way . he won't touch it ! and this dog loves peanut butter more than anything ! that tells me all i need to know .

this drink doesn't fit in either category . i am both an avid tea drinker and sort of a manic coffee person . i have definite likes and dislikes when it comes to both tea and coffee . this beverage sort of fits into a " no man's land " when it comes to either . i tried it as espresso ( as the name suggests ) and ended up with a murky , thick , sludge like drink that was anything " but " espresso . next , i tried it as a tea in the finest mesh strainer that i have , same results . . . terrible . i tried it hot , i tried it cold . it was like trying to make a beverage with the fine grit left at the bottom of my vacuum cleaner bag and had about the same appeal . i gave it two stars because rooibos is chocked full of health benefits and it is 'supposed' to be good for you . that presupposes that you can stand to drink it . i can't . rooibos tea is available in blends from major tea outlets such as tevana and i have tried it from other sources with no difficulty in preparation or loss of flavor . it is not the rooibos that i object to , it is the way this manufacturer chooses to process it and way you will have to scramble to find a way to fix it that you can at least drink it . there are too many enjoyable flavors of tea and coffee for me to sample without all the irritation and drama that this product causes me to go through . i was not in any way happy that they chose to call it " espresso " as it is far from it . it is as a matter of fact far from anything that i want to experience again . go buy some rooibos tea or espresso and enjoy them . this is a failed experiment and a terribly misleading product in my opinion . 
=================
no interest my dog loves dogswell sweet potato chews , which i recently learned are made in china . i had hoped that these sam's yams would make a good substitute . however , these are much tougher , really like rawhide , and my cockapoo has no interest in the product . i'm not even sure she realizes that it is something to eat . maybe it would appeal to a larger dog that enjoys chewing . 
=================
no scoop ! this is the second pacific health brand i have used , the first being the orange flavored accelerade . i tried this one because it has less sugar . it also has less protein , which i didnt know until i got it , my bad for not checking ahead of time . the product taste fine , but it did not come with a scoop , which i found odd , especially since the directions state that one serving size is one scoop . maybe i just got the one can that didnt have a scoop . overall a good product .

bottle caps aren't just for bottles ! ! bottle caps really take me back . back to a kid in the 70's . back to when candy bars were bigger , and only cost 9c at the local candy shop . when we had 4 different stores where we could go and gaze at all the variety of candy to spend our meager allowance on . if you are looking for nostalgia , try bottle caps . they really take you back to when there were bottle caps on the actual bottles !

warning - arsenic found in this type of baby formula i was looking for a formula for my 18 month old twins and was shocked to learn today that those made with organic brown rice syrup contain particularly high levels of arsenic , compared with products without this syrup . seventeen baby formulas were tested in the darmouth college study . according to the today show , " two of the infant formulas contained organic brown rice syrup as their primary ingredient . these products had arsenic levels 20 to 30 times that of the other infant formulas . . the amount of arsenic consumed by an infant could be significant depending on which formula they drank . . arsenic exposure early in life may increase the risk for health problems later on . " the study , published in environmental health perspectives , indicates that organic infant milk formula containing obrs as the primary ingredient had total concentrations up to six times the epa safe drinking water limit . the formulas tested were not named but a quick search turned up that baby's only organic toddler formula - both dairy and soy - uses brown rice syrup as its main source of carbohydrate . i for one will be passing on this product .

hardly the best i've ever tasted i am an enthusiastic fan of sorghum . have spread it on toast as if it were jam or jelly for more than 50 years . and i was down to the last eighth of an inch in a jar a friend had picked up for me at a farm stand in ohio . when i unpacked my 42 once jar of amish sorghum i noticed the label message that " cirtric acid added to prevent crystalization . " that puzzled me , but i was looking forward to finishing off the old jar so i could try the new sorghum . when i dipped my spoon in i found it to be very thin , similar to a rich pancake syrup . most pure sorghum is much thicker and doesn't need to be treated by citric acid for any reason and i have had an open jar on a cupboard shelf for months without problems . this tasted fine , but at the end it had the aftertaste if honey . i believe these folks may be cutting their sorghum with honey . this is not the first time i have purchased a jar that was not pure sorghum . i have purchased it direct from farmers and found it was not the real stuff . and that's what i think is the case this time . 
=================
does not taste like bleach it's not bad . i'm a big fan of green tea and lipton's brand does a good job at matching the quality of japanese brands . the leaves inside the bad are cut into smaller and finer pieces than japanese ones but that doesn't seem to affect the taste that much . if you like green tea , you should definitely give this a try . it is a lot cheaper than anything else out there at this level of quality .

cryptic instruction this package contains two large pieces of folded paper , the trap frames , which are obvious . also some small but essential pieces which are less obvious . the instructions are in various places ; a bit like putting together a jigsaw puzzle where you have no idea what the result should be . eventually i thought i had it right and then placed the traps . tonight i found another piece , no idea what it does . modern product design is supposed to accomodate both people who speak english ( i do ) as well as people who have a limited command of it . this needs to go back to the drawing board on that score . what they could do to improve would be walk around ikea a bit , and then redesign their instructions so that zero words are used , and the instructions are in one single place . or at least take a focus group of people entirely unfamiliar with moth traps and rate them on their ability to assemble this . i don't know whether i have put it together correctly or not , but so far the traps are empty . if you have prior experience with this product this review may sound silly ; there aren't that many pieces and somebody who has done it once correctly can probably assemble them in 5 seconds flat .

like fudge smells and tastes like freshly baked white chocolate fudge . one thing to be aware of is that the tea bags are unevenly flavored . some of them taste very strong and some rather weak while most of them are in between .

no sour taste at all before trying this product , i tried making a native starter , just picking up whatever yeast was flying around in the air in austin , texas . that worked from a functional point of view , but had no sour flavor . in the process , i got myself a nice glass jar ( formerly a clausen pickle jar ) punched holes in the lid . i made sure to use wooden utensils when mixing . i went to the baby aisle of the grocery store and got a bottle of distilled water to make sure there would be no chlorine present . everything worked as described all over the place . . . very active starter . . . somewhat slow rising . . . pretty good bread texture . . . just no sour flavor . so i purchased this product . i followed the instructions carefully , feeding every 12 hours , using a glass container , stirring with wooden chopsticks and using distilled water . it took three days to activate and another day or two to get very reliable . . . and at that point it was . . . . indistinguishable from the local starter . no sour aroma or flavor whatsoever . in other words , a packet containing 1 / 2 tsp of ordinary flour would have worked equally well .

choking hazard - beware my 10 month old has two teeth coming in on top and three on the bottom . he eats cheerios , gerber puffs , soft cooked vegetables and ripe fruit with very little problem . i tried the earth's best barley biscuits because he is prone to food allergies and i wanted to avoid wheat . every time i gave him one of these biscuits ( 3 times ) he was able to bite off too big a piece and gagged , not to the point of actually choking , but enough to send me into a panic watching him struggle and turn red . they don't seem to dissolve in his mouth fast enough . on the upside they taste good without being overly sweet . i think they are better suited for a little older babies who have more teeth and have really mastered chewing . i will try the mum mum rusks as a previous review suggested .

more than it's worth i first began using the roasted barley to make a beverage almost thirty years ago while learning hapkido . it is good for the heart , stabilizes the pancreas , and works as a fat emulsifier . it goes well with roasted corn to make an even more healthful drink . i would suggest buying it from a local korean , chinese or japanese market . i just got 4 bags of roasted corn and the roasted barley for less than $ 9 . then you can either brew it whole on the stove , or grind it and brew it in a french press . both ways work well . adding sugar or honey diminishes some of the health benefits . in spring and summer i have it at room temperature . if it is cold outside i drink it warm . either way is great . try 4 tablespoons to a quart of water .

my dogs love it , but the ingredient list gives me paws . . . ahem , pause chef michael might be a fictional character in the same vein as aunt jemima and the keebler elves , but that doesn't excuse him from putting some truly nasty ingredients into his grilled sirloin dry dog food . so many other reviewers have pointed out the list of dubious ingredients that it doesn't pay to duplicate them again , but i urge you to take a long , hard look at that list before you commit to purchasing this item . nutrition aside , this is a very tasty food item based on my dogs' response to finding it in their bowl . frankly , they went bonkers over chef michael's grilled sirloin dry dog food . i'm probably not going to make this part of their regular diet , but i will continue using it as a treat . 
=================
so - so product with high shipping costs the taste of this product is so - so . it is easy to mask with cream cheese , nut butters or anything else for that matter . however , considering that trader joes sprouted bread tastes great and only has 7 net grams of fiber per slice , i will stick with that . pop a couple of fiber pills and you can get the net carbs down to 2 if you are really counting carbs that closely . 
=================
at least i can say i tried it . i'm interested in trying new things , especially when they sound completely different , so when i heard of banana ketchup i had to do it . i don't really know what i was expecting , but it is exactly what it sounds like . if you don't want to pay more than the product is worth in shipping just to sample it , try putting regular tomato ketchup on a banana . if that sounds like your thing , you'll probably love banana ketchup . if not . . . well . . . at least you can say you tried it too .

it made my hair fall out at first i loved everything about this shampoo and conditioner . it smelled great , my hair was manageable , it curled perfectly . then my hair started falling out . a few strands extra here and there . but my family starting saying mom your hair is everywheres . then the clumps started coming out . i have stopped using the s & c the clumps are still coming and i am forced to swish my foot over the drain thru my entire shower . hopefully it will stop i really enjoy having hair .

freshpak rooibos taste change i love this tea and drink several cups daily . i just bought 4 packages of freshpak rooibos tea with an expiration date of dec 18 , 2009 . these are packaged differently and do not reference south africa on the top . the taste is very different however ! the tea is much milder and actually a bit sweet . i am very disappointed that the formulation seems to have been changed .

folgers is better i got this coffee at a local market when our whole beans stocks dwindled . . . . my husband and i are both coffee 'snobs' we had to wean ourselves of our peets habit when we moved from california last year . this coffee is sub - standard , dried out , tasting of dish water . instead . . . try a green mountain coffee like the espresso blend or the newmans blends

not enough time for full evaluation . our ckd raskal did eat some , and the other 3 normal cats had some also . all we put out was eaten . unfortunately raskal was already stage 4 when we received it , and passed after only 2 small bowls so the remainder will be donated to a local shelter .

leaves an after - taste i applied this rub onto a pork shoulder and let it sit overnight in the fridge . i smoked it for 10 hours the next day and the meat turned out fabulously . the rub gave a definite spice to the shoulder but i found it heavy on the paprika and somewhat sour with an after - taste . the ingredients were very straightforward and pretty much what you find in almost all of the rub recipes online but i think i'd prefer a little sweetness to complement the meat . next time i'll try mixing my own spices but it'd be handier to have everything pre - mixed . 
=================
i love goat milk , but too bad . . . . too bad this stuff in general ranks high on the inflammation triggering foods . i'm trying to follow a low inflammation diet . i do love the taste of goats milk . it's very rich and creamy . the liquid is better than the powder . 
=================
savored every drop i am lucky to live in an area with a large asian community , and we have an excellent malaysian restaurant that we visit frequently , and many asian groceries . therefore , i've been able to try several varieties of randang curry , from both of these types of places . this is the best version of homemade that i have ever tried . i'm sure that the addition of several of the traditional spices of the region ( pandan leaf , lemongrass , and kafir lime leaf , among others ) is what gives it that restaurant quality taste . what is also similar to a restaurant version , unfortunately is the calorie and fat content . . . and this doesn't even include the meat , approximately 1600 per box , so take that into consideration when determining portion size . i would suggest you stretch it with some vegetables , potatoes , peas or broccoli would all go well with this . also read the allergy advisory on the packaging if you have any issues with nuts , shellfish , fish sesame , eggs , soy or mik . i am pleased that they do not add msg to this high quality product . enjoy , but not too much ~

thumbs down i gave my 4 cats these treats one night . they were still there in the morning , completely untouched . i brought them to my friends house to see if her cats liked them . we gave them to her 4 cats and only one liked them . so 1 out of 8 cats approved . not a good ratio .

oops we have not received this as of yet . it is expected to be shipped in february .

nothing special , really got babybrezza 5 month ago . nice for steaming , but blending never worked properly . here is why : 1 . when you steam the food a lot of water gets accumulated in the food container - too much , so before i blend i have to get some water out . the instructions said that you can get water in the food container if you put too much water in the water chamber - this not true , i tried everything and no matter what there is just too much water in the food container . 2 . the food is not blended enough to be as smooth as the babies prefer there food , so i ended up blending the steamed food in the blender . and , there are always a couple of chunky peaces in the bottom of the container after blending . fine , i could use the blending function on a later stage , i thought . but . . . 3 . after 4 month of use ( mostly for steaming ) , the blending function is not working . the machine makes a loud noise but the blades do not move . some reviews suggest how to repair this " flaw " , but seriously , i just gave up . finally , i got a hand mixer and happy with it . the baby does not need all foods to be pureed anyway now . i considered babybeaba before i got babybrezza , but my fried had issues with that one since the steaming chamber cracked within two month and the replacement did exactly the same again . other flaws of babybrezza : - loud when blending - a piece of plastic broke on the bottom of the food container after 2 months . i would have returned it after the first use but my husband threw out the box instantly . : )

service disappointment ! i tried to order more for the high freight and could not contact you or figure out how to order more for these high freight rates and so i was told by your customer serice that i had to return the shipment for a refund and i did that and have not recieved a refund . we can not get this product locally , my 2 and 4 year old grandaughters love this product . they insist in haveing the stars not the round . they will not eat anything else . after i recieve my refund i would like a call from someone to explain your very hard to figure out websight and talk to me about to satisfy my grandaughters with this product . the product needs to be in the local stores .

great food , bad cs first of all , i am subscribed to receive two boxes of the variety pack every month . my cats love the food and refuse to eat other canned food . i have tried to give them more expensive , better quality food but they only want petite cuisine . that said , i am quite disappointed at p . c . 's customer service . after researching on menadione , i emailed p . c . and asked if they plan to not use menadione in near future . i never heard back from them . before this , i received an email from them with a coupon code . i tried to copy and paste the code on their web site and it didn't work . i emailed their cs and they told me that the coupon was working . come to find out , they misspelled the coupon on the email . the code contained the word " cuisine " and they misspelled it . i emailed them back about it and they didn't responded nor sent out another email with the correction . very disappointing indeed . . . in the future , if i find another brand that did not contain menadione and had better customer service , and i would instantly switch over to the new brand . well , my cats have to like the new food too , which is why i haven't able to give them something else yet .

for ethnic hair . not clearly stated though this is for ethnic hair . the marketing is a a bit poor for it , and it doesn't explicitly say so on the packaging . i thought it would be good for my thick hair for after swimming . it is not . i did , however , give to one my my friends who can benefit from it . she noted that it works very well , adding needed moisture to her hair . it is not overly greasy as many other hair products for her can be . she recommends it .

almost the switch you're looking for . . . it's a fantastic idea . 100 % juice meets carbonated beverages with none of the undesirable additives . add to that a wonderfully rich flavor ( think jolly ranchers , but more vibrant ! ) and an incredibly reasonable price tag ( less than $ 1 per 8 . 3 fluid ounce can ) , and the switch sure looks pretty perfect . except , of course , for one little devil in the details . the switch uses juice concentrate for its beverages . this , in itself , is not a terrible thing , but the water that's later added at the bottling facility is " filtered sparkling water " which is a flowery way of describing filtered tap water . they take the good water out of the juice and add garbage . considering the whole concept of moving away from all that's unhealthy about carbonated beverages , one would think they could have made the drink a little more expensive and used spring water . funny how " sparkling " strongly implies spring water even when it actually promises nothing . i find this downright deceitful . also , as a side note , do keep in mind that any carbonated beverage is going to contain sodium and , therefore , will do little to actually refresh you . drink this because you like the flavor , not as a source of healthy hydration . there's nothing wrong with the fact that the switch is carbonated . in fact , it's part of its charm , but that necessarily makes it less than 100 % good for you . so the switch has a lot going for it , and i wouldn't be averse to picking one up every now and then , but contrary to what the can promises , this is not " 100 % of what you want " with " 0 % of what you don't . " " sparkling water " is what you get when you run your tap through a brita filter and nothing more . does the " 100 % of what you want " take into account the fluoride , pipe rust , and grandma's discarded anti - depressants , all floating around in the tap water they're adding to each can of the switch ? if so , the company's wants differ greatly from my own .

meh . . . nuts are okay the nuts seem . . . old . you know what old filberts look like . i had hoped they would come vacuum sealed as another reviewer has said . instead they arrived double bagged and inside a usps cardboard envelope ( not a box ) which had torn a bit . no packing material , no packing slip . i'll find another supplier for the next batch . live and learn .

what a shock ! claxton fruitcake has been a family tradition since i was a child . . . so after several fruitcakeless years spent in south america i made a bee line to the nearest grocery and to my delight found stacks and stacks of claxton . the mere number in the store should have been a clue , but i didn't see it that way . noooo . . . lots and lots of that delicious fruitcake was my take . well , the moment i bit into the first slice i was disappointed . the pecan stuffed fruitcakes of my youth had been replaced by a tasteless almond filled concotion . i did find a suitable substitute at costco that far out shined the claxton of my rose colored memories . in three words , " don't buy it . " at least not until they replace the pecans .

unsatisfying - * unless * heated edited - these cookies are quite good ! but * only * if you microwave them . i put them in usually about 30 secs , butyou just have to do it till you can tell its softened . if you dont heat it , then you can't taste the chocolate chips at all and as a result is really unsatisfying . although , in my opinion w a really good snack you shouldnt have to do anything to it . but , w . e . in conclusion - these r realli good and youll get your $ worth , subscribe its only like $ 2 . 30 for each 7 oz packet . but , dont eat these unless you have a microwave at hand , or it really isnt good otherwise .

cats stopped eating it pretty quickly i like weruva's other flavors , as do my cats , but the outback grill variety has a lot of gelatinous filling that the cats don't like to eat . i end up having to throw out quite a bit of it because they only eat the chunks of fish .

big bag ! the package was even larger than i expected ! the bag is roughly 1'x1 . 5'x0 . 5' and contained at least 20 10 - inch rawhide rolls . it has a printed expiration date on the bag ( 2 years from the time i purchased them , which is far more than adequate for my heavy chewer ) . according to the information printed on the product , the rolls are 100 % beefhide and made in paraguay . so far my 3 year old 25lb terrier mix is crazy about them . she can go through one roll in a few hours , but i usually let her have half of one every few days .

you gotta be kidding ? i have lived in south louisiana for the past thirty years and am currently working in northeast pennsylvania . and though i can make my own roux i have reached the stage where i have no problem with faster shortcuts . but the price on this product is well out of line . i expect everyone to make some money but a 1000 % price markup is a little much . try zatarain's new orleans style gumbo base . it is available from amazon and almost as good .

tooooooo sweeeet this was a free sample . we were walking in laguna beach and offered the hubert's lemonade sample . at home , i drank a few sips and it is horribly sweet ! the 2nd ingredient is sugar and there is only 10 % fruit juice . why do kids , especially - - or adults need this extremely sugary drink ? i diluted it with about 40 % water and then it is refreshing - - still very sweet . hansen's , i'm surprised at you . marlene / aliso viejo

my cats all love it ( but . . . . . ) i normally pick up the rc special 33 formula at my local pet food supply chain . however , prices keep creeping up and now they want $ 29 ( before tax ) for a 7 pound bag . so this month , i ordered royal canin via amazon , and also grabbed a bag of rc indoor 27 . i am saving $ 8 or $ 9 on each bag and it's being delivered to my front door ! all my cats gobble up the special 33 ( higher fat content than indoor 27 ) , originally intended for my vomit - breakfast cat , sage . generally , sage does not toss her cookies after eating special 33 . but it always helps to give her halo wet food first to settle her tummy and then the kibble . however , there was a different problem with my special 33 dry food order . the first night , the cats didn't seem interested it in and left a lot on their plates . odd . the next morning it was gone so they eventually ate it . next night , i happened to be in the kitchen under bright lights when i noticed the kibble looked shiny and wet . i scooped up some in my hand and it was literally oil soaked . somehow this particular batch had gone wrong . rc headquarters in missouri told me it was probably due to how the food was stored or shipped ( very hot or very cold temperatures ) that made the injected oils seep out . who knows . i'm thinking perhaps it stayed too long under the appetite enhancer spray machine at the factory ( they do that , you know ) . i threw it out and amazon happily and easily shipped me another bag . keeping fingers crossed that this bag of special 33 will be just fine . update may 2012 : after buying several bags of special 33 royal canin and verifying they were fine when i first opened them , after a day or two , the dry food again became slick and overly moist . i have determined that the food is just fine but it is altered by exposure to air somehow . my kitchen is not too warm nor too cold so i don't understand why the formula changes . one of the ingredients must pull in moisture , sort of like the latest and most expensive women's anti - aging creams that hydrate .

more like a green tea i am an avid tea drinker , have almost tried all the best brands and thought this might be one of them hidden treasures . but . . . . . . . this is not even close to a dark black tea . it smells different , taste different and is not even black in color . you can fairly call it a good green tea . it tastes more like persian broad leaf green tea . as a green tea i will give it a 2 star , and as a black tea it gets zero .

cat loves better then vet prescription food very early this year ( 2010 ) my vet diagnosed my cat with a urinary tract infection and gave her royal canin urinary so canned food . she liked it somewhat and seemed to get better . when the vet said that she would have to come back for another office visit i decided to try the purina urinary tract equivalent . my cat just loves it ! when hungry , she finishes off a 3 ounce can in about 15 minutes . i still give her the vet food as well but she never finishes off that food as a fast . she also eats the purina dry food , that i leave out , but not nearly as fast . unfortunately she is sick again ( weight loss - but not hypothyroid ) . blood work has not determined what is wrong with her . he wants another $ 500 for xrays and other stuff . she nearly 17 years old , so i'm not sure what i'll do . 
=================
yummmmmmm editing this review because there just isn't any taste in these things so i have ate maybe 2 or 3 packs of the caseits a boring snack to be honest
=================
taste is perfectly fine , don't know about the ph thing this water has a nice taste and the bottle is nice and sturdy to hold . what else to say about this water ? oh yes , the ph . i did not feel any different after drinking this water than i do after drinking any other water . it did absolutely nothing to even try to blow my socks off , and the asking price is too high for it to be so mediocre . this water didn't come from some rare source so the price tag is unwarranted . so why the 4 stars ? because it tastes like good water , as it's supposed to . if it were sold for the same price as sam's club water then i'd buy it . also , i think i'll stick to gatorade as opposed to expensive filtered tap water when i need electrolytes . 
=================
tea totaller we enjoy our keurig for coffee but tea leaves ( sorry ) a bit to be desired . somehow the taste provided by the steeping process outweighs the expensive convenience of the k - cups . for those of a like mind , we would suggest the following . buy your tea loose . you will probably save money , can control the quantity per serving and will end up with better quality . loose tea is available from amazon . purchase a adagio teas ingenuitea teapot thru amazon . efficient and brews a good 16 oz . cup of tea . for a few dollars more they have a 32 oz . add a bit of tea to the teapot , place the teapot on your keurig and fill with hot water . wait the appropriate steeping time and your tea is ready . for those who would like a warmed cup to pour into . fill the cup with a bit of hot water from the keurig and let it warm while the tea steeps .

where's the head ? you reckon when the ad says " whole rabbit " you ought get the whole rabbit . i ain't got a head on this critter ! my neighbor kids sure love playin with them rabbit heads . if i ain't got a rabbit head fer makin peace with them neighbor kids they prolly gonna come bust up my old ridin tractor . without my tractor i can't even get up the corner store for no beer . another thing is i ain't even got any intestines fer sausage makin ! how is easter dinner gonna be any good with no varmint sausages ? this thing looks like it coulda been a guinea pig or a chinchilla or somethin . i mean , it tasted pretty damn good with hot sauce , but i reckon i oughta shot my own critter next time around . that or scrape one up off the main road , sure is cheaper . least they left some bones in there for my ol coonhound to chaw awhile . mavis gives it four stars but i'm only givin it two on account of no head or nothin to make sausages with . reckon also if you ain't familiar with rabbit don't be expectin to feed no three grown men on one , ain't enough eatin on em . 
=================
the most taste - less earl grey ever i love drinking tea , and earl grey has been my choice everywhere i go . i enjoyed brewing tea from tea leaves , a habit that i have given up for the ease of tea bags . twinings tea had always been my pick until this last purchase from amazon . earl grey totally lost its poignancy . even two bags of tea could not brew a decent cup of tea . at first i thought it was the recent degradation of earl grey tea as a result of climate change etc . then i tasted other brand's earl grey and found acceptable . i went to the length and bought another pack of twining earl grey tea from a grocery store , and i tasted alright . so i can only conclude the tastelessness of twinings earl grey is associated with packages i bought from amazon . i found this to be true with amazon's darjeeling tea as well . 
=================
not as good as it sounds . . . kraft pure honey . sounds wonderful and " oh - so - wholesome " , right ? well maybe , but there is a problem . when this product arrived i learned that it was a product of the usa , brazil , and vietnam . there are two problems with that . the first is that us honey producers are struggling to survive , and cannot hope to compete with the price of honey produced in the third world . why do we care ? because they are vital to our survival , and our ability to produce food . we need to make a concerted effort to patronize us honey . the second concern is that many pesticides banned here in the us are still used in places like vietnam and brazil . ( and the ones still in use here are bad enough ! ) because of the nature of bees and the production of honey , it seems inevitable that some contamination is likely to occur . for that reason , i am not terribly thrilled with the idea of consuming honey originating anywhere other than the us , canada , or europe . other than the above concerns , the honey is well packaged , and visually attractive . but i am now looking for a source of honey packets containing only honey sourced in the us . 
=================
smaller than expected these are much smaller than i expected . i had purchased some pine nuts at a whole food store , and each nut was almost twice the size of these . these are also a little darker in color , but i don't know if that is significant . perhaps these have been " toasted " ( although there is no reference to that on the packaging ) . 
=================
pricey stuff and hardens up real fast ! i thought i would try this stuff for my finicky dog who needs moist food along with his kibble . he was not a big fan of it and it was the most expensive moist food at petsmart . the other problem is this stuff hardens up like concrete in his bowl . if he wouldn't eat the food in about two hours the stuff turned as hard as a sidewalk and i had to literally scrape it out of his bowl . 
=================
had problems - - - the taste is very good . problems i had were that this was european product soi had to figure how to convert to cups and ounces . although i like the taste andconvenience , i will not purchase again because of expensive s & h . i will lookfor this product locally unless it's offered by amazon on super saver . 
=================
french vanilla cafe's new maxwell house blend i agree that the new french vanilla cafe's new maxwell house blend is not as good as the original . i don't know if you have changed your recipe , but i use to drink it and feel " ummm " . now i have to add sugar or some other sweetener and it isn't the same , it is too bitter without it though . i would order this if the original taste was back . general foods international coffee , french vanilla cafe coffee drink mix , 9 - ounce tins ( pack of 6 )

wow ! exceeded my expectations the reviews helped convince me to try this product , as i was looking for a really good quality packaged country gravy . i like country gravy from time to time , but seldom want to go through the trouble of making it myself . this is definitely the best one i have tried by a large margin . i don't think i could make it better and i cook very well . the flavor is very rich . the consistency is smooth and velvety . i didn't even add one spot of salt . . . that was amazing in itself as i was sure that i would need to add salt ! what i did , that was ever so slightly different from the instructions , was to go ahead and get the 2c of water boiling . meanwhile , i have one of those tupperware shakey things and put the other cup of water & the mix in that and shook it up . it blended up super well . then , when the water boiled , i got a whisk and slowly poured the mix into the boiling water while whisking . it only took a minute to return to a boil and come up to the proper consistency . the thought of buying 24 of these super - sized packages was a bit daunting , but i put them in airtight containers in the freezer and i think that should keep them even past the expiration date on the packages . what i do , since each package makes so much and i am usually just making a little something for me only , is to freeze the remainder of it in single portion sizes then i can vacuum seal each one separately with my foodsaver and take out one portion at a time . that works best for me , as i have found that if i just put country gravy in the refrigerator to use over a several day period it gets kind of gross and separatey , even in airtight containers . it freezes and reconstitutes very well if stored properly . 
=================
pretty bad , and i drink coconut water daily , have tried many brands ! i adore coconut water . have since i was a kid . have had it out of the shell ( we are caribbean folks ) , chilled , and from assorted canned and bottled types , with and without sugar . i've tried a host . some brands i did not wish to revisit - - vitacoco is funky tasting to me . new zico ( bottle ) sucks . old zico ( tetrapak ) used to be nice , but after an intolerable and underhanded experience with their marketers online , i refuse to buy them anymore . o . n . e . is fine , and my sister loves it . i've had harvest bay , amy and brian , nature factor , and some names i forgt . i prefer taste nirvana these days , when i can't get the fresh ( ie , froms hell ) or raw organic one that whole foods sometimes stocks . this was not good . naked . ugh . i was out and about , thirsty , and stopped into a nutrition s'mart to buy coconut water . this was the only brand they had that i hadn't tried , so i went for it . ugh . never again . i cannot recommend this to coconut water lovers . but , hey , i like to at least try other brands . you never know which one will rock your world . and , as they say , different strokes . you may like this brand . but you might wanna give taste nirvana , amy and brian , o . n . e . and some others a shot first , ya know ? : dhappy gulping ! 
=================
packaging really bad i was very disappointed when my milk arrived , soaking wet because the pkg was not securely packed and one of the boxes of milk broke open and was all over the other boxes and packing box also . i have ordered this before and it came in perfect condition , because it was packed solid in a double box . so i was short one box of milk because it spilled everywhere inside . thanks , lynnette
=================
sugar added it's a sweet sugar added beverage ( so of course it's sweet . you could add sugar to any other coco water and make it taste 'better' ) . tried it on sale but wouldn't buy it again . 1 . taste nirvana or c2o2 . vita coco3 . one or zico ( it's from concentrate - but the chocolate is a great post long run drink and delicious ! ) 
=================
paid way too much ! no troubles with the product . i had used it before and could not find it locally . . . . so . . . . ordered it here . well now that is is stocked locally for pennies over $ 8 . 00 , i realized i paid twice that to get it on line . feel ripped off for sure . . . . . 
=================
cost jump ? good product , but the price has gone up by $ 15 in the last month - no longer a good value . any reason for the huge increase ? 
=================
do not contain high fructose corn syrup i love quaker chewy bars in a couple different flavors , including chocolate chip . mostly because they do not contain high fructose corn syrup , and also because they provide a healthy in between meals snack .

super yummy if you like hershey kisses and coconut then what could be better . the inside of the kiss is filled with a creamy slightly crunchy coconut creme . takes lots of control to stop eating them once you start . my favorite were the caramel kisses up until now . these are just super yummy ! ! ! update to the above review ; it's been over two weeks since purchasing these kisses . i went back to order more and to my shock the price has more then doubled . i am so upset because i promised to buy some for friends . i really am amazed at such a great increase in price . amazon is my all time favorite online store but such a change in price is just wrong . a google search is turning up much better prices for these hershey treats . i hate going elsewhere but what's fair is fair . this is plain wrong
=================
interesting product , but not highly recommended the black salt seems a little bit mouisture . when you are seasoning in you dish or pan , the black colour may spread over . " although not as popular as the traditional red alaea salt , hawaiian black sea salt , or lava salt , is a dramatic , glossy black sea salt . the unique color comes from lava , which adds minerals and activated charcoal which results in a sulfuric aroma and earthy flavor . hawaiian black sea salt is used both as a finishing salt and a roasting salt . it is often used as a coating on fish to help preserve both flavor and moisture as it bakes . suggested uses : delicious on all types of seafoods , especially shellfish such as clams , mussels or scallops .

blue buffalo wilderness cat food i felt that my 13 yr . old siamese ( lester ) with a sensitive stomach , sometimes overeating and throw - up problem would benefit from a new " grain free " kibble . after doing some research , i choose blue buffalo wilderness over the evo that i had been feeding for a few months ( the evo had major dust and i had to sift it before feeding . . maybe 15 - 20 % by volume ) . towards the end of the second bbw bag i noticed that lester ( and my other cat ) were not eating their normal amount and their litter box wasn't as full . lester then was not cleaning up well after a # 2 , then in a couple of days stopped eating everything ( even his daily wet food snack ) , we took him to a vet ; blood work good , but x - rays show that he had large air bubbles in his stomach and upper gi . he couldn't eat anything without throwing it up . . nothing . the vet made no suggestions other than keep trying to feed him ; and it was only after going to petco and talking with their staff did we take action with a syringe , baby food ( beef ) , electrolyte , and a high protein cat paste all slurred and injected every hour that we got him recovering after a few days . i can not be sure it was the bbw cat food that deteriorated lester's health to very close to euthanizing , but i had not changed his wet food only his free choice kibble to hill's age defying and he is back to normal now . the hills has grain , but the kibbles are smaller and easier to digest and i am suspisious of blue buffalo wilderness and / or maybe that an older cat's system can not handle very high protein dry kibbles . he was ok on evo so makes me think that bbw was the problem .

there is no accounting for taste ! i don't mean to be disrespectful to the other reviewers - and we are all wired a bit differently , i know , especially the taste buds - but these truffles are substandard and quite nearly inedible . you people are simply not chocolate connoisseurs or , simply put , you have never had " proper " truffles . how could anyone imagine that these are the best chocolates they have ever eaten ? it staggers the mind . do yourselves a favor and try some real , well - made truffles - you will be surprised . these are not it - even though these are made in france - that was the reason i bought them ! the person for whom i purchased these candies said " these things are a triumph of quantity over quality . " how true , how true . how can one champion a truffle that lists as its very first ingredient palm oil - followed by sugar and reduced fat cocoa powder and then whey ? palm oil , sugar and whey do not , in this case , contribute to a quality product . these things taste as if a third - grader whipped them up - they are leaden , oily , and , yes , a triumph of quantity over quality . triste !

this is about my last order the last order for planters redskin spanish peanuts that you sent us was the ones with sea salts . i orderthese redskins for my wife . she says they are not as good . i will not order any more peanuts if the sea saltsare all that you carry now . the only reason we order from you folks is because the old redskins are hardto find in our local stores . the ones i ordered had the red label . the ones with sea salt have a brown label .

yeah , that was unfortunate . don't think the previous reviewer is wrong , jaded , or somehow a veggie jerky competitor . these things really are rubbish . what's worse ? this good deal through amazon means you'll have plenty of these meat flavored sponges to impress your friends with how bad it can get . i will say that my friends and i found that if you leave them out to dry for about 48 hours , they do get a little better in the texture department . but to quote one friend , " well , that made them easier to spit out . "

tried dreamfields spaghetti & it was awesome . . trying lasanga tonight ! i was just looking a reviews on here as well , and realized that if people order their pasta from here they are way over paying for it ! you can order direct on their website for a 1 / 8th a price ! just do a google search for their actual website . i hate to see when people are getting ripped off for something they did not know about .

a poser at best we all know that swiss cake rolls will never achieve the delicious status enjoyed by yodels , but i really do give them an a for effort . the major complaint with these snacks is that they are just too dry . they attempt to surround creme filling with some kind of chocolate cake , but the result comes off as a cheap tasting joke . i don't really have any advice for little debbie to improve this product , though . they should simply leave it up to the experts at drake's snack foods .

too much maltitol . . . these chips look like the real thing and they taste alright but there is simply too much maltitol in them , especially for a single serving . the other drawback is that if you are sensitive to maltitol or have blood sugar issues , these are going to upset your system . i do get a craving for chocolate chips now and then ( rarely since i'm low - carbing it ) so i'm going to try and " dilute " these with wondercocoa powder or sugar - free dark chocolate in a recipe and see how it turns out .

tasty treats - questionable source treats smell so good i would like to eat them myself . they are manufactured in china and they look shiny on the outside and i am not sure how that happens to the chicken and the company has not responded to my questions about this . i have concerns because of china's reputation , plus they eat dogs in china , so how concerned could they be with making a clean expensive dog treat for rich americans !

break the cycle of overpriced single serve cups of coffee once and for all ! ! just because these come in a tea bag type of pouch does not mean they can not be brewed in a single cup ( $ 20 ) coffee pot . i tried this method of brewing single cups of coffee out of disgust with the price of the all - mighty k cups pods . with k cups , i found myself spiraling toward financial ruin simply to enjoy coffee in a single serving cup . so , for a fraction of the cost here is what i recommend . purchase a $ 20 single serve coffee maker , doesn't matter the brand but this is the exact one i use with the metal permanent filter removed single serve coffee maker . . . get the cheapest one you can find . all it is doing is heating water - keep that in mind . put one of these tea bag style pouches in the filter compartment . push it down really good in the filter holder and make sure the water won't flow around it as it hits the bag . sit back and wait , soon you will have a perfect cup of folgers coffee . i have not brewed a pot of coffee any other way since going to these . i have purchased hundreds of packets and have never been disappointed . i just hope folgers doesn't realize what they have here and jack up the price . so . . . cut yourself loose from the k cup cycle and with the cash you save treat yourself by purchasing one of the out - of - service space shuttles , or send an entire class of graduates at your local school to harvard .

i wish my toddler liked it i really wish my toddler liked this . it seems to be very high quality and it would provide more variety in his diet . every so often he'll eat it , but it usually needs to be mixed with something else . i think it tastes fine , but it wasn't a hit . i bought a case so i keep trying .

eh its okay i was excited to try these out . it's not like the marshmallows you get in the cereal . rather its more like the tiny marshmallows you get in those packets of hot chocolate . i tried it with my cereal and you know what it's definitely doable . that's why i rated it 4 stars . i'm sure other can find more applications for it . just beware that 12oz is a lot ! sadly i couldn't finish my marshmallows and i left them near a window with direct sunlight . not a good idea . they will get sticky and icky ( not the good kind either ) . try them out if you like mini marshmallows this will not disappoint , kind of .

fiber : 1 , farts : 20 this product is known to give people gas . i actually counted over a period of several days and each bar caused me to fart 18 - 22 times from four to six hours after i ate it . if you live alone or are on cipro for athrax exposure and your intestines are sterile , maybe you can live with that side effect . otherwise , it's better to give to someone as a joke than to eat yourself . other than that , it tastes pretty good if not too sweet . additional comments 17 months after my above review : first , let me state on their box general mills had plenty of room to educate about different fiber sources while promoting the variety of fiber products they produce . i had a chance to try target's generic competitor to this food product and found the same stinkin' results . using wikipedia ( yes a printed dictionary would be more reliable ) i see that the main ingredient of these products , called " chicory root extract " , is full of an indigestible sugar called inulin that ferments into gas in your large intestine . inulin is no doubt responsible for the too - sweet taste of the bars that i mentioned in my first review 17 months ago . another vegetable containing inulin is the jerusalem artichoke for which wikipedia has the following snippet : gerard's herbal , printed in 1621 , quotes the english planter john goodyer on jerusalem artichokes : " which way soever they be dressed and eaten , they stir and cause a filthy loathsome stinkingwind within the body , thereby causing the belly to be pained and tormented , and are a meat morefit for swine than men . " ergo i conclude fiber one bars are more fit for swine than men . if people knew that in year 1621 , why is general mills putting out an inulin - filled product now ? and why in all their biased , pro - fiber packaging is there not a single mention of the gastrointestinal side effects known to effect a large swath of the population for almost 400 years ? corporate food scientists don't just throw random boxes from the undesirable vegetable dispensary into a stew , and somehow get instant fda approval and national distribution channels , folks .

hard to give a clear review and i say that because this product isn't designed for my hair . my father is caucasian , my mother is vietnamese . i have a lot of hair . i wouldn't call it oily , but in the summer it can look that way if left to it's own devices . my hair is a little longer than shoulder length and i have rather heavy bangs . in the virginia summer , my ends can frizz . and i dislike it , so when i was given this to try , i thought it would be right up my alley . as others have mentioned , there are no directions on the jar , but i gave it a shot . let me say this . . . it smells wonderful ! and i thought i would use it like a leave in hair treatment . since it is so thick ( someone else said almost like shortening , and i would agree with that ! ) i used just a bit and coated my hair with it . my hair felt nice as it was drying , but a few hours later it felt heavy , and rather greasy . i didn't like the way it felt , and i jumped in the shower again to wash it out . the more i looked at it the more i began to think this is not for women with my hair type . while looking online i did indeed find the product , and it is marketed for african american women . i was very surprised to find that the main ingredient in this is petrolatum . the same stuff in ad ointment . why would you to put that on your hair ? as i stated , it is hard for me to give a proper review as it isn't made for my hair type , but i can't imagine anyone wanting to put ad ointment / vaseline on their hair .

harsh and less than enjoyable gold kili all natural instant ginger and lemon is a powdered drink mix that can be served using either hot or cold water . the fine powder dissolves quickly and the beverage is mixed and ready to drink in less than one minute . i like the taste of lemons and ginger , but i wasn't prepared for the taste of this beverage . i admit that it does have a nice , enticing aroma and the combination of these two ingredients sounds appealing , both for the potential flavor and for the settling effects on the stomach . however , the taste of this beverage is not what i expected . it doesn't taste as natural as i thought it would and it has a certain harshness that is most evident in the back of the throat . i followed the directions and added a cup of hot water , but considering the harsh flavor , perhaps i should have used more water . among the flavors present , the ginger is the one most noticeable and it's the spicy finish that creates that harshness . i was able to finish mine off by taking only small sips at a time , but i can understand why some would have a difficult time drinking this instant beverage . my enjoyment of spicy foods and drinks made it a little more tolerable for me , but i would bet that others would have a difficult time consuming this drink . ginger and lemons might be a nice combination , but they don't mesh very well in this instance . i won't be buying this drink again , as i found it less smooth and less enjoyable than its taste combination promises .

sugar not hfcs finding a cola made with real sugar in my area is quite the challenge . anyone who thinks coke made with high fructose corn syrup is the same as coke made with sugar is kidding themselves . hfcs is a corn byproduct that is so refined and converted that even the food industry admits it isn't " natural " . i realize that soda isn't exactly a health food item , but i refuse to drink anything that has artificial ingredients such as hfcs or the poison known as " splenda " . the coca cola conglomerate isn't doing us consumers any favors by selling their poison . it's a shame we have to purchase this product from mexico .

as described but difficult to use i bought the kit to dabble in spherification . the item is as - described and arrived on time . my complaint is that the instructions measure the required chemicals in fractions of grams . my kitchen scale measures as low as 1 gram but does not do fractions of grams . i cannot find a kitchen scale that measures fractions of grams . therefore i find the kit difficult to use . i would not recommend the kit because it requires the purchase of specialized scale that can measure tenths of grams .

not as awesome as i'd expected i have friends who are raving fans of the mallomars . i figured they'd be a big hit with me too . after all , there aren't very many junk foods that i don't like . if anything , i have impulse controls issues and have trouble stopping at just one of anything . so i was really surprised when i tried my first mallomar yesterday . i expected to really have to restrain myself and avoid scarfing down a bunch of them . but no . one was enough . i had no desire to try another . i guess that's lucky for me , because at 60 calories each , these pack quite a payload . hmmm . maybe i was in a bad mood or there was a sampling issue . i can't honestly form an opinion on just one , so i tried another one a few hours later and then one more again today . i had the same feeling after every one of them : too much dark chocolate flavor . i like dark chocolate a lot , but these have a surprisingly long lasting dark chocolate aftertaste . the marshmallow inside is really first rate . marshmallows can get stale and funky pretty easily ( except for rock hard easter peeps ! ) . so yes , they really succeeded with the filling . the cookie was ok , but it didn't hold together very well . it tried to split vertically , which i expected , but it also delaminated horizontally and made a big mess . the cookie taste wasn't as good as i expected . it was fresh and buttery , but there was no sweet flavor or even any graham flavor . it was just a buttery shortbread taste ( and messy ) . and besides the dark chocolate aftertaste , my other lasting impression was that the three tastes ( chocolate , marshmallow , and cookie ) really didn't marry very well in this treat . they don't combine into a distinct taste like a s'more or a moon pie . they're just three individual tastes . or actually the marshmallow and the cookie are just delivery systems for the dark chocolate flavor . i've probably really made you mad by now if you're a mallomar fan . it's fine with me if you like them : different strokes . i wish i could share the rest of my box with you . but if you do like them , is amazon the right place to buy them ? my box of mallomars had a pretty rough ride . the chocolate was marred pretty badly and at least one of them was damaged . i don't think the packaging from nabisco is sufficient for shipping these by ups or fedex . i'm sure they do just fine on the regular truck to the grocery store , but freight shipping is a different experience . i'll post a link to a photo so you can see the condition of the contents . it's the cool autumn in southern california right now , so the contents weren't melted . they would have been badly damaged during the hotter months . so there you have it . it's a treat that a junk food junkie like me can turn his back on . and it's a shopping experience that will probably be disappointing to real fans of this treat . i recommend you pass this item up . check out the product photo that i posted . it shows the condition of the cookies when they arrived .

no pollen . . . according to foodsafetynews . com on 11 / 07 / 2011 ; 77 percent of the honey sampled from big box stores like costco , sam's club , walmart , target and h - e - b had the pollen filtered out . ultra filtering is a high - tech procedure where honey is heated , sometimes watered down and then forced at high pressure through extremely small filters to remove pollen , which is the only foolproof sign identifying the source of the honey . it is a spin - off of a technique refined by the chinese , who have illegally dumped tons of their honey - some containing illegal antibiotics - on the u . s . market for years . amazing what corporations do for profit . pollen is what i consume honey for . pollen is what helps my body as a medicine , a super food , antioxidants , etc . for my health . without pollen , i might as well consume sugar . fancy grade a , natural , pure and even raw are very misused words . these words are used to fool consumers just like it is done in every sector of the food industry . conventional honey simply does not even come close to organic since it has many unwanted ingredients like gm plants , pesticides , etc . which harm the environment , the honey bee and my health . i consume manuka as well as certified 100 % organic raw honey from reputable source . that way i get the pollens and the antioxidants in the honey like i am suppose to . you will be surprised what you will find in your neighbourhood organic stores . i purchased one container from costco but now i know better .

great idea , poor execution where , oh where can you find a tea strainer that doesn't leak ? these tuffy steepers are cute , look practical and easy to use , but they fail at their basic purpose . . . straining the tea and keeping leafs out of the brew . they collapse into easily transportable shapes , come with a little lid that serves as a base for the hot , wet strainer when finished , they're dishwasher safe . . . but they don't keep the loose tea out of the brew ! infuriating . plus , they're awful big and take up a lot of room in the cup , so when you remove the steeper , you're left with a 1 / 2 cup of tea . one other thing , there's a funky clip that you can see in the pictures . it's a small plastic thing that extends out over the steeper , for what purpose i can't tell . it might have been better designed where it repositioned to extend out and down , so you could clip it over the rim of the cup to steady the thing . i was disappointed by these . great looks , little function . my hunt continues .

shipping having ordered two of this item , they were shipped in one small box losely packed with only air pillows . one had leaked and the other had the seal broken . i ordered only one replacement , explaining how all the other jugs of maple syrup were packed to prevent damage . the replacement arrived undamaged , but again loosely packed in a small box with only air pillows . as there are other alternatives on amazon that are shipped properly and the seals are more substantial , i recommend ordering one of them .

food good , service not so much my cats love this food , but i would not choose to deal with pet food direct again . half of the cans in the 2 cases i bought , are dented and this company is useless to try to deal with . i will stick to the food that is sold by amazon only . who needs the hassle .

this is a first for me wow , i've never not liked one of the coffees or teas that are made for the keuring . . . at least until now . weak and flavorless and is the best i can say about this . you get neither a good tea taste nor a lemonade taste . you do seem to get a bit of a bitter after - taste though . this may be due to how much the ice cubes melt during production . frankly it is easier and less expensive to have a gallon of a good brand pre - made combination drink on hand . brewed on 8 ounce setting as per manufacturers recommendation . * sample provided by the manufacturer *

bad shipping - decietful customer service if you plan on purchasing this item through kitty hawk wholesale as a gift , and think it will arrive by a certain date , think again . my experience with kitty hawk wholesale was that they dragged their heels on getting this item out and then they lied regarding when it was shipped and when it would arrive . maybe they prefer to only ship on certain days . who knows ? but the popcorn was great ! my father much enjoyed it when he finally got to sit down with it , two days after father's day .

absolutely gluten free crackers and flatbread absolutely gluten - free flat bread and crackers are both excellent products . i have now placed two orders of 5 boxes with amazon as the price is more than $ 2 less per box than in my local grocery store . unfortunately , on both occasions , the product has arrived in 85 % shattered condition . gluten free products are very unstable vs . wheat products . i would recommend the product highly , but i do not recommend getting them via mail order if shipping standards cannot be improved . edith streubert

sugar - i knew i was making a mistake i remember buying ragu a few years ago and never buying it again , but i could not remember why . just look at the container , its tomato sauce , what could go wrong . everything about it is wrong for me now that i tried it once more and i am writing a review to remind me later . this contains sugar and sugar is same as poison for me , the taste just makes me mad . the container label says there is only 10g of sugar per 1 / 2 cup / 128g serving , but when i eat it it feels like 50g . there is no tangy tomato flavor , it feels like i am eating juice or jam or something too sweet , not pasta sauce like . i compared it with a can of " del monte chunky garlic and herb " sauce and del monte is so much better . it contains 9g high fructose syrup in place of sugar but i felt it was much more satisfying , tastier , less sweet and more tangy than ragu and its cheaper too . did i miss to say del monte is chunky while ragu is not ! , even when labelled chunky . if you want to buy del monte sauce online with fast shipping try amazon's grocery site " soap " dot com . ragu is america's worst tasting sauce not like advertised at all , more like america's favorite tomato flavored jam / syrup . also double checked ingredient list on the bottle and it says sugar while amazon says corn syrup . amazon should have said sugar and helped me save $ 18 , so 1 star for amazon too .

what a disappointment for reference , i've had several kona coffees before and loved them all . i had high expectations for this coffee after reading the reviews and then after smelling the beans . the smell of the beans is the only good thing about this coffee though . i was skeptical when i saw how very dry the beans were as if they'd been sitting on a shelf for quite a while . i decided to go ahead and make a pot of french pressed coffee regardless . based on how bad it was ( couldn't even finish the cup ) , i'm guessing that everyone giving this good reviews must be dripping this coffee . still , i can't imagine that it's very good either way and i have to wonder what kind of coffee is normally drunk by the people who rated this as good . this is nothing like any of the kona coffees i've had in the past . it's not even close to being on par with the sumatra i've been drinking lately . if you normally drink pretty good coffee , especially if you grind your own beans that have a nice oily appearance , i'd recommend avoiding this one . i'll probably be throwing the rest of mine out .

a little different baja precious has a somewhat different flavor than the extra virgin olive oils to which i am accustomed . i would describe it as lacking the slight sweetness of my previous brands . without supporting evidence , my suspicion is that the difference is due to the absence of adulterants added to virtually all other brands , regardless of quality . too soon to evaluate in use , but whether it turns out better or worse , at least i received what i paid for - 100 % olive oil - for the first time , it seems .

used to work , does not any longer this was a godsend a few years back ; today , the dispenser fails in two ways : 1 ) the dispenser will fall apart one time in three2 ) the dispenser will not dispense properly : what used to last for 5 minutes of spray will now take 1 / 2 an hour for the the bottle to get to 1 / 2 empty , and try as you might , you'll never get the last 1 / 4 outnot only does it not dispense , it does not kill mosquitoes any longer , even if i use my ortho dial - n - spray to dispense it . why does it no longer kill mosquitoes ? because they changed the formula . it used to be 2 . 5 % permethrin ; today it's 0 . 16 % lambda - cyhalothrin ( brand name cyonara ) my father in law shares the same disappointment ; he loved it when i introduced him to it , but now he can no longer use his yard after a record rainfall in ny and a bumper crop of mosquitoes .

not much different from the angel hair shape tofu shirataki i did a review for the tofu shirataki noodles angel hair shape and so this will seem repetitive if you read that review . for those who have read my other review , the only difference is the noodles are wider and seem as if it has a harder texture ; but in actuality it just appears that way because the noodles are wider . the first time i heard about shirataki noodles was years ago and i decided i would try it . i went to fiesta and got the tofu shirataki noodle both the pasta and the fettuccine shape . shirataki are made from konjac yams and the added tofu gives it a harder texture . the noodles without tofu added is 0 calories . the first time i ever made shirataki noodles i cooked it like regular pasta ( the spaghetti shaped ) and it turned into a gel - - this was years ago . i learned that was the worst mistake to make and changed how i made these noodles . the next time i made it correctly and tried to eat it with pasta sauce . that didn't work for me , since the flavors did not merry and i was accustomed to the hard texture of pasta . when i tried the fettuccine shaped shirataki the first thing that came to my mind was lo mein . when i made the fettucini shaped noodles with soy sauce , some ginger , and stir fry veggies , i realized that these noodles are better with asian style recipes . always remember to rinse this product first . to me this noodle has no flavor , it takes on the flavor of what you cook it with . be sure not to overcook it and you will be fine . i personally do not cook it longer than 3 minutes . update : i did some more research on shirataki noodles in order to expand my ideas with recipes . i found that the reason that my shirataki noodles may have turned into mush was because it expired . it seems shirataki noodles is still good for a year and even after it is still edible however it would turn to mush if cooked too long . these noodles also apparently shrink and become thinner , something it seems some people like . i went to the store where i used to get my tofu shirataki noodles , and looked for an expiration date . lo and behold , it was expired by over a year . i even saw some in the store expired by over 2 years . it seems that non expired shirataki noodles will become alot more chewy if cooked too long . my mom used it in stir fry , and i have also tried it baked which is also a great idea . i have been lazy and just use any boullion cube with the noodles and that works fine . . . i just let it sit in the seasoning for a few hours to take the flavor of the soup . an additional update : i found out that the government allows a company to list a product as 0 calories if it has 4 or less calories . on the bag it will say 0 calories for half a bag . the entire bag could be anywhere from 8 calories or less . i researched this after seeing a pickle at 0 calories for 2 / 3 a pickle and seeing an entire pickle for 5 calories .

ok to use 6 months after expiration not too acidic , not too bitter - very well balanced . have used wtih no problem at 6 months after expiration date on package . just seemed a little " clumpy " at that point but tasted fine . much better value per unit than smaller packaging . i ordered off the starbucks site directly at this price , didn't notice a short expiration so wonder if it is amazon fulfillment issue ?

ugh ! horrible tasting coffee . worst french roast i've ever had . what am i gonna do with four pounds ( less a half dozen scoops ) of this stuff ? i was hoping to find a decent french roast that i could get at a reasonable price , and take advantage of the free amazon prime shipping . but who is jeremiah , and what exactly was he picking ? this was not the solution ! the beans in this coffee are visibly inconsistent in their roast . some beans appear almost raw , some are dark like good french roast should be , and most are mildly brown like a columbian . the beans also are small in comparison to all other coffees that i've tried , although i don't know what that signifies ; the appearance is like beans that never fully matured . i've avoided starbucks coffee - although its generally very good , they kind of burn the beans , plus its way overpriced to get the brand name . the best alternative i've found , and the one i'm going back to , is the barista brava french roast found online at the sam's club site . the beans are dark , plump , and consistent in quality , with a flavor at least as good as starbucks . it might be a little more expensive than jeremiah's pick once you throw in the shipping , but at least its palatable .

artificial taste , typical stimulent based energy drink this bottle of fruit punch flavored vitamin squeeze sat in my refrigerator for a while . i usually drink filtered water and i don't typically like to add anything to it . but the vitamin squeeze product seemed like a good thing to try , not only for the flavor it adds to water but for the small array of vitamins this product adds . when i finally got around to trying it , i wanted to judge it based on flavor and health benefits based on the ingredient list . for flavor , i did not really care for this product . the sucralose gives it that unmistakable artificial taste , and the first word that popped in my head when i tasted it was " fake . " it tastes cloyingly sweet and artificial , like those bottles of " healthy " fruit punch you see in the juice aisle . for the health benefits , i am always somewhat skeptical of any product that claims to increase " energy " yet contains no carbs or calories . and like most " energy " drinks , one of the ingredients is " natural caffeine " mixed with an assortment of b - vitamins and an amino acid . in my opinion , this product might increase your energy levels temporarily , but much of that effect comes from the stimulant properties of caffeine . the real test of a product like this is " would i drink it again . " and the answer for me is " no . " i found the taste very artificial and i don't like using sucralose - containing ( splenda ) products . ( i switched to truvia natural sweetener a long time ago ) . i am also sensitive to caffeine , and drinking any caffeine containing product after a certain time leaves me with insomnia . personally , i would prefer skipping this product and continuing to drink plain water , taking a vitamin supplement for the extra vitamins . so overall , i do not recommend this product . the only reason i upgraded from 1 star to 2 stars is the fact that this product does contain some beneficial vitamins , unlike most ready - made , highly sweetened fruit punch drinks .

pistachios these were good pistachios with few bad nuts but there were a lot of unopened pistachios or very hard to open pistachios , i had 50 + unused pistachios from each container at least

clogged up my keurig this stuff tastes great . however , it is not really coffee . it is a flavored drink on the order of hot cocoa . it has a lot of calories ( 80 per cup ) and sugar . it also clogged up my keurig big time .

love redbull , hate new amazon price i have absolutely no problems with red bull and love the stuff . i used to get it from here for me and the folks at the office . only now with the amazon price hike i'll have to go somewhere else . 
=================
really tastes better ! i've been trying to buy this off the shelf and just could not find it ( for , like , 2 years ) . i mainly wanted it for texture - - table salt is not fine enough . this stuff is so fine it completely changes the flavors . i wouldn't have believed it myself .

tasty , enjoyable morsels for your pooch too ! chef michael's grilled sirloin dry dog food for adult dogs with potato and green bean garnishes is a hit with my dogs ! o the crunchy kibbles and tender pieces appealed to them . they have taken to it very well and sought more please . . . . this may be a cost savings compared to buying pouch or canned foods for mix - ins that encourage the dogs to eat less palatable offerings . o top 6 ingredients : beef , soy bean meal , soy flour , animal fat preserved with vitamin e , brewer's rice , soy protein concentrate . . . extensive ingredient list . . . check the ingredients for items that cause your own dog problems . o product is a welcome addition to the purina dog food range of products which historically contain corn as the main ingredient ; a cause for digestion problems since it comes out pretty much the same as it went in . . . . haven't noticed any digestion or poop problems . o vitamin powder smell reminds me of when i had to add vitamins to my parents' show & hunting dogs' meals . . . a positive addition . o there are no artificial preservatives . o prefer ziplock closure for the bag like some other dog foods . o price is moderatley more expensive @ $ 2 . 24 per pound . . . . let your budget be your guide if this item is to be included in your dog's regular daily menu . it will be an option but not an every day thing . everyone in my house is belt - tightening ! update 7 / 31 / 2012 : 1 . using moist morsels as treats was very positive . another reviewer shared the idea : ) 2 . mixing chef michael's dog food with pooches' other dry dog food has them selectively picking out the moist morsels and eventually returning later to finish off the remaining grub . . . too smart for their own good and lovable .

i never got this . it has not shipped . i'm sure it's a fabulous tea , but it never came . still waiting . . . will i get it ? it's been a very long time .

tastes like dust / ash i was relieved to see that another reviewer felt the same way i did when they described this product as tasting like " dust . " the word i had in mind was " ash . " even when doctored with cheese , it's just very ashy . you can drop your pasta or dip your bread in an used ash tray if you want to get an idea of the flavor this product provides . which is too bad , because the concept of pesto in a tube is great . it gets bumped from 1 star to 2 for the concept alone . the formula needs serious work , if not a complete overhaul . 
=================
they ruined their perfect product ( the only legit , non - oil - sprayed eg widely available ) as you can see , i ordered a set of three boxes of these , happy for free shipping and a good price , which amazon usually lacks on groceries . . . and how disappointed i was , not in amazon but in numi . . . i guess too many complained that the smell wasn't like other egs , and they're right . . . it wasn't . others spray alcohol - containing , leaf - wrecking oils on the leaves , leaving behind a horrible taste to me and also making the leaves oxidize rapidly , making the tea quality suck ! numi had it absolutely perfect . i was ready to tell you how to get , out of their tea , the perfect genuine earl grey tea , one where the tea wasn't killed by modern techniques of spraying chemicals ( essential oils are almost all alcohol , after all ; bergamot oil is almost always mixed with cheaper and easier to process citrus that grows far more places than a tiny town in italy ) . . . and now , i'm just here to say " move along , nothing here to see " because in changing their fruit supplier or aging / malting process or - something - ( the tea leaves wouldn't likely vary so much , the brews side by side making the same color and the leaves being cut the same way and clearly the same region and process - - yes , i'm one of those tea drinkers , steepster reviews and all ) , from the bags smelling like another brand , a rather costly one that starts with r and nearly rhymes with fishy , which has rather funky eg ( that brand sprays the leaves , which numi proclaims my shared disdain for ) . . . well , what was - - back when they had the boxes with the old man and his walking stick slumped in front of a cottage or whatnot - - the first and only eg i would drink happily , a tea i went to specific 24 / 7 restaurants at 2am when needing food just because i could at least count on the tea . . . well , it's a passing memory , one i have about half a dozen more memories to treasure before parting ways with numi , probably with an email expressing sadness . i do overall recommend their teas : the lemon myrtle chamomile , now deceptively called lemon chamomile when it's the flower not the fruit added to lovely organic chamomile , is hopefully still as wonderful , their moroccan mint is unsurpassed and the smoothest , sweetest mint imaginable , impossible to oversteep for that matter , able to handle a trio of steepings for that matter [ whereas stash uses pnw mint that is medicinal , which is honestly only good to make yogurt sauce or . . . medicine ! ] , and even for the ones like golden chai that aren't to my liking , they're still well made , just not a blend i care for ingredient - wise . . . i simply can't recommend this numi product anymore ( and i hope as i use the last of my others this proves the only one that got " revamped " somehow , the " how " seemingly the fruit , whether they are doing it faster or using different fruit or outsourcing the bergamot processing or . . . whatever they changed to make it a stinky - bagged , fruitless flavored , bitter chemical - aftertaste tea ) . i tasted the new just one night after a week of delighting in their original blend night after night , using my reliable method with precise timing and all , went away from it a full month , and in finding the last half box of the old , decided to compare them to be sure it wasn't simply me being thrown off . it's not . i don't deem it so unworthy that it can't be a pleasant change for the people who benefit from our brunch outreaches geared at homeless populations , and it'll probably be a welcome addition , but i will not be drinking the other 51 bags from this purchase myself , not when i have teas i genuinely love ( as i did this , which was barely drinkable with a lot of sugar that rendered it barely - even - tea anymore - - before , it was best with a tiny bit of sugar and milk , but it was absolutely palatable with no additions ) .

shipping costs the shipping cost for these necco candy wafers is $ 18 . 50 almost the same cost as the item . no thanks ! !

stopped working i used the thermometer about 7 or 8 times and it stopped working . i have seen several reviews complaining that the probe fails so i'm hoping that's the problem . update 2 / 27 / 08 : i ordered a new probe from brookstone for $ 25 ( incl . shipping ) and it is a much sturdier design than the original . i assume they were getting a lot of complaints and returns so they redesigned it . so far the new probe is working fine . interesting to note , i gave a negative review of this product on their web site and they never published it , although they sent me a thank you note for my review .

an excellent corn and gluten free cookie that does not hold up in shipment this is rare find in gluten free cookies when it comes to flavor and texture . unfortunately rice based products tend to crumble and these cookies are no exception . mine were purchased locally and one third were broken . it is possible that better packing would reduce breakage as the current packing does not restrict movement of the cookies . worse , this packing does nothing to distribute g forces evenly across each cookie when the box is dropped . old style cookie tins have crinkled paper cups and shock absorbing corrugated cardboard . pamela needs to take advantage of our ever expanding knowledge of the physics of how things break . put another way , pamela , s package is like a car with no seat belts , no airbags , no safety cage and no crumple zone . additional cost would be small in my opinion . rice cookies made with honey or molasses hold up better as these sticky sweeteners have gluten's glue like binding power . it may not be possible to make shortbread cookies more durable while maintaining the excellent taste . i cannot eat real shortbread so breakage is better than nothing .

great product ! great price ! i don't usually write reviews but i feel i have to share this . first of all , i want to say that this is probably the best deal i've found yet for coconut oil . it smells and tastes wonderful and it arrived quickly ! next . . . i actually bought this to give to my mother , who is in the late stages of alzheimer's . recently , i've read quite a few articles that praise coconut oil for helping people with this affliction and decided to give it a try . my mom , who is now on hospice , spends most of her days sleeping . when she is awake , she's in a 'zombie - like' stage . she rarely speaks and doesn't recognize any of her family . she won't eat anymore . . . only drinks ensure . anyway , i brought this to her caregivers and asked them to start mixing it into her ensure and giving it to her 3x a day . after a week , i went to see her to see if there were any changes . all i can say is wow ! ! ! not only was she awake when i went to see her , she recognized me as soon as i entered the room . and here's the really cool part . while i was there visiting , a family member of another resident told me a joke and my mom starting cracking up ! ! i said , " wow , mom , you laughed . " to which she replied , " well , it was funny ! " i nearly cried ! i doubt she'll ever get back to her old self again but if this can help give her a better quality of life , i'll make sure she has a never - ending supply of this wonderful product . needless to say , i'll be ordering more ! 
=================
don't expect coffee flavor i know some other reviewers have raved about this product stating it is mild , and is the closest thing out there to real coffee . well , let me tell you if this is the closest thing we're all screwed . when i made it the smell was akin to someone who just had a cigarette and then came inside and sat down next to you . seriously , this stuff is pungent . and if you are a real coffee drinker who drinks it black to taste the flavor of the bean you will be disappointed . i understand this is a coffee substitute and realistically it's not going to taste exactly like coffee but this isn't even close . i promise i'm not an angry , bitter person just a coffee drinker who expected more . i did some research and found out about cold brewing which takes out approximately 70 % of the acidity in the coffee which helps a gerd sufferer such as myself . you can use your favorite coffee to do it too and it tastes great because it is actually coffee . i used 12oz of coffee mixed in with 6 cups of water in a pourer container . let sit for 24 hrs in fridge and then used a super fine strainer to keep out the grit and poured into a second container to hold the coffee concentrate in the fridge good for two weeks . i then used 1 . 5 ounces ( a shot glass to the top ) plus 6oz of hot water and it tasted exactly like my usual morning cup of coffee minus the heartburn and symptoms associated with gerd . they do make a french press called the bodum bean which i just ordered to simplify the whole process .

amazon michael season's thin & crispy unsalted potato chips - sad news the taste was very good on this product but i bought the 12 pkg plan and the bags each were anywhere from 1 / 3 to 1 / 2 crumbs or small pieces you would only use on top of a casserole . no dipping or presentation wise nothing . however since i need unsalted chips they were worth a try and i need to cancel future orders of this one and stay with the michael season's kettle ones which of course were more durable and they too taste the same as the others . amazon please note to cancel automatic shipping on this product but keep the one for the kettle chips - thanks
=================
so - so wish i could say i loved it , but it was so - so . i did use it , but just not quite enough taste as some of their other items . 
=================
beware i love chiclets . too bad the manufacturer may have blown it by using a new rubbery gum base that renders it almost impossible to chew after a couple of minutes . yet another fine product down the drain due to what is likely to be cost cutting . .

inferior product - - the most moist , delicious , & sustainably caught sardines are , by and far , the wild planet brand ! i tried both the " season " and " crown prince " brands and the difference in flavor and quality was light years away from the wild planet brand . i live in new england and can only find wild planet brand in my local stop and shop . it's amazing that we have 3 " whole foods " markets in my state and not one carries the wild planet brand ! they are only carry what i believe to be the inferior quality brands that i mentioned . i'm sure that the hoffman and manischewitz families that own crown prince and season brands wouldn't mind having the wild planet brand alongside their own , since they feel theirs are such great quality , right ? who knows , they just might learn something about having high standards from the lovely bunch of people that own wild planet in california . to top it off , all wild planet products are in bpa free cans . . . what more can you ask for ? 
=================
crap - e diem i apologize to the makers of this drink for saying this , but it is just not good . at all . to be honest i think it tastes curiously like mouthwash . i can't really get past that and enjoy it . it's almost like mint tea that has waaaaay too much sugar in it or something . i am a huge fan of synergy / gt's kombucha , but i thought i'd try this because it's slightly cheaper . i have to say that the synergy is well worth the extra $ 12 per 12 bottle case ( i purchase the cases at whole foods for $ 35 ) . even if i could get past the minty mouthwash taste , i still have to question the health benefits of this brand of kombucha given the ingredients list . it reads : lightly carbonated water , sucrose , herbal tea blend , kombucha cultures , lactobacilli , acerola juice concentrate . you don't even get to kombucha until the fourth ingredient - and that comes after water and sugar ? ? one can drink seltzer water with sugar and " herbal tea " for much cheaper than $ 23 / 12 bottles . seriously . spend the extra few bucks and buy the synergy , whose ingredients are as follows ( this is for the " trilogy " flavor ) : 95 % gt's organic raw kombucha , raspberry juice , lemon juice , fresh pressed ginger juice , and 100 % pure love . bottom line , if you want mint soda , then by all means , seize the day . if you want real , raw kombucha with health benefits and a delicious taste , go for synergy / gt's kombucha . 
=================
decent gift , not great i bought this as a gift for a co - worker , and she told me her family enjoyed the cheese a lot . that said , i was disappointed with this as a gift , as the box was much smaller than i expected and the unattractive , very loose ribbon made a weak presentation . ( i couldn't re - tie the ribbon or even remove it , since it was attached with a sticker to the box and would have ended up tearing the box . ) overall , i won't be buying this as a gift again - better to find a great local cheese shop and wrap everything properly . 
=================
waaay to salty to enjoy . i tried really hard to like the product ( it comes in a case of 12 after all ) but i just could not take the taste . it looks like regular chili , has some fat like regular chili , has a texture like regular chili , and it almost tastes good , if you can get past the salt . this is the second , and last , of this brand and type of veggie product i will try . they rely too much on salt to compensate for the perceived lack of flavor from real meat . a much better , imho , veggie chili can be made with some diced onions , tomatoes , green bell peppers , a hot chile of your choice , garlic , oregano , chili powder , a little masa , tomato paste , and one or more types of beans , like pintos , kidneys , mayo coba , etc . just a pinch of salt and your done , or add your own meat or substitute if you have to . i hope there are some vegetarians at the food bank . edit : i'll add that many canned foods tend to be a little salty to me , so we don't eat too many of them . i will say that compared to other canned chilis i have tried , vegetarian or not , this compared favorably . but , i can't take salt out of a prepared food whereas others can always add salt . this was the deal breaker for me , as it is with other prepared , canned chilis . 
=================
doesn't work well in my b70 i got these k - cups for use in my b70 and immediately started having problems . my b70 ( freshly descaled twice in the past 2 weeks ) has problems pushing the water thru these kcups . i routinely get under fills and after using the kcup my descale light keeps illuminating . as soon as i run a cycle with out a kcup , the descale light goes away . this issue seems to be specific to the newman's blend and others like green mountain nantucket blend seem to work fine . 
=================
sls - full i will never understand the soaps from mainstream , and sometimes otherwise great brands , who claim to have a line of " sensitive skin " products which still contain sodium lauryl or laureth ( as in this case ) sulfate . if you're someone who needs sensitive skin products there's a more than decent chance that you also need stuff without sls . boo . refer to their bar soap , which is wonderful . 
=================
a winning brand extension , but i wish the packaging were nicer tabasco habanero is similar to regular tabasco sauce , but more picante . if you haven't tried it , you should try a smaller bottle first before committing yourself to a gallon of the stuff . see , for example , tabasco brand habanero sauce 5oz . as others have noted , you'll want to have a funnel and a smaller bottle to transfer the sauce into for daily use . i have one at home and another at the office . my only disappointment is that the one gallon jug lacks pinache . a plastic cap ? customers loyal enough to buy this thing probably want to show it off , but to my eye , this jug looks cheap . 
=================
i can't believe the price doubled ! since june 2011 , the price went from $ 15 for 6 cans to almost $ 30 for 6 . that is a terrible price jump . i love the oatmeal but not at that price . i will find another , cheaper , place to purchase . 
=================
too expensive ! ! ! short and sweet . . . very good coffee , but way too expensive here . . . try costco . . . 34 dollars same item , same count ! very upset the way amazon has raised all the prices on coffee . . i know beans have gone up . . . but a sale once in a while couldn't hurt . costco . . 34 $ dollars for the same 80 ct . somebody is overcharging us consumers tony
=================
amazing ! i got this drink after my brother had one and said it was amazing . i believe his words were " viagra in a cup " lol . he said that it made his sex life amazing . i was curious to try one , but no stores will carry something with the word " gasm " in the tile . the day it arrived it just so happened i hadn't eaten at all since early that morning and it was about dinner time . i had one , which tasted great , a nice little buzz in the brain came on after a couple sips . i didn't notice anything after that so i immediately had another one . i didn't realize it takes a few minutes for these to take affect . i was seriously sceptical about these but a few minutes after after my second something happend . bam , this stuff had a major affect on me . i have a high libito to begin with , but after taking two of these , oh my gosh ! i've never had sex before or anything like it because i'm waiting to with my wife , so believe me when i tell you this stuff does not help when living an abstinence lifestyle lol . i had to go workout for 2 . 5 hours to work off the amount of " energy " this stuff gave me . this is not a placebo affect i assure you haha . for this to work best you have to take it on an empty stomach and it really does work . hope this helped ! 
=================
not so cluster - y the quality is good but its more like eating seeds than clusters . there is no way you can just grab a handful and go . you have to have them as a topper on yogurt or oatmeal . this product would rock if it was in clusters . i will not be purchasing it again because of this reason
=================
not the best can of rice and beans , but certainly the least toxic . it is kind of spicy , which is nice , because otherwise it would be very bland . i got the eden black beans as well , and they are a lot worse without the caribbean rice . of course , the best feature of these products is the bean cans do not have bpa toxicity , as well as no toxic ingredients or sweeteners . no salt even ! if you want the rawest , natural , bare beans and rice . here it is . hopefully you can season and flavor foods if there's not enough oomph in them , or you know someone that can . 
=================
not what i expected i got a box of assorted skittles and starburst . the picture showed a mixture of starburst , skittles , m & ms , and 3 musketeers . 
=================
damaged jar , can't return . i love barney butter almond butter and like buying it in bulk . but , it does not save me money to get 2 good jars and one damaged jar that i cannot return , which is what happened when i ordered here through amazon . it is just too risky for me to purchase it here , because i don't know if i'm going to get three good jars or 2 . . . or 1 . . . or none ! and then there is nothing i can do about it . grocery items are not returnable and there is no way to contact anyone about it . as far as the almond butter , it is perfect ! we eat it on everything , toast , english muffins , waffles , graham crackers , apples , pretzels , tortillas . it's smooth and easy to spread without being drippy . it's not too sweet or bitter . i'm just thankful there were 2 good jars ! ! but , that made them $ 12 a piece . . . yikes ! 
=================
wrong ingredients list don't buy this food if you are looking for the primary ingredient to be meat . the ingredients list on the product page on amazon says " chicken , turkey , chicken meal , ocean fish meal " before any grains are listed . this is wrong . the package as well as chicken soup website list it this way " whole grain brown rice , chicken , turkey , chicken meal , turkey meal " while it's possible that it may still contain enough meat , i still don't trust that it does . any dog food you buy should contain 1 or 2 ( meat ) meal ingredients before any grains are listed . if it doesn't say " meal " after the meat , it means the meat weight was measured before the meat was dehydrated . if it says " meal " after the meat , the weight was measured after the meat was dehydrated . therefore , " meals " constitute more meat in the product composition than meats listed without meal after them . from the ingredients list on amazon for this product , i expected the meats included were less fatty , hence the " light " description . this is not entirely the case . they have reduced the meat and upped the grain in this formula . either get the regular version of the chicken soup food or consider another food . for more info on dog foods , google " dog food analysis " . some good budget friendly alternatives that are better and cheaper than this product are the diamond naturals dog foods . amazon carries these foods as well . search for " diamond naturals ( meat here ) and rice " they have chicken , lamb , and beef varieties . also , diamond naturals makes the chicken soup line of foods , but they are typically cheaper . just some food for thought . 
=================
my kitty was sick after eating only one of these . . . i bought these thinking they would be a slightly more productive treat for my 6yo , small , male cat . usually i give him little pieces of plain fish or chicken , but was happy that there was something that might lessen how often i brush his teeth ( since he hates it with a furry passion ! ) . i gave him one thinking if he liked it i would give him more , but didn't want to confuse his system . after about 3 minutes , he threw up everywhere . more than once . i didn't want him to be sick , but he was so excited and had gobbled it up so fast i thought i would try the other flavor . same thing after only one greenie . he's an extremely healthy cat , very active and has never had a single health problem , but these made him so sick . after he threw up he wouldn't eat for two days . i was going to take him to the vet , but he perked back up , and started eating normally ( hasn't thrown up once since ) . obviously it's not like this for every cat , but i looked into it further and if you read reviews from other major sellers there are many problems like this in perfectly healthy cats . some reacted even worse than mine , so i was lucky . 
=================
i used to love this gum . i remember when stride first came out . i was amazing how long the flavor lasted ! with this new 2 . 0 stride sweet peppermint , it just doesn't last as long . i like the foil wrapper ( they don't " sweat " like the old ones ) . the flavor and consistency are great too . however , the flavor just doesn't last like it used to . so overall this is a step in the wrong direction . 
=================
nice tins i emptied the contents of the tins and used them for other tea . the tea seems to give me bad gas . i think the product could be old , but the date suggets it is still good . as for the taste , i would give the product 4 / 5 stars . people should give it a try since everybody has different opinions . 
=================
i'd give this a 3 . 5 star rating i am a mojito junkie . give me a minty mojito on a hot summer day ( make sure you're not skimpy on that booze ! ) and i will be in heaven . no joke . i originally saw these crystal light mocktails in my grocery store a month or two ago . while intrigued , i chose not to purchase this product due to my sensitivity towards artificial sweeteners like aspartame and sucralose . both tend to give me headaches and nausea , depending on the amount consumed . my reaction got so bad that i actually had to give up gum at one point ( but i am a gum - aholic , so . . . ) . lucky me food manufacturers put those things in everything . but i digress . when i saw this was being offered to vine members , i knew i had to give it a shot - - sensitivity be damned . two days ago , i received my mojito mocktail in the mail . i opened a package , poured it into a huge pitcher , and filled it with plenty of water . upon taste testing , i was semi - impressed . like another reviewer said , this was like a watered down lime drink . the mint is there , but it's not very strong . i knew it was missing something - - and not the booze . luckily , i had club soda in my fridge , so i poured half of a mini bottle into my glass . instantly , my drink became a lot more appealing , and hence why the star rating is a 4 . by itself , this mocktail is okay ( probably 3 stars ) . with the addition of club soda , it becomes a lot tastier ( 4 stars ) . and while i know that this is supposed to be a mocktail , i cannot help but wonder if this would be good with some alcohol in it . i'd test it , but i got my nausea / headache from the aspartame and sucralose after a few hearty gulps which means no more for me . would i recommend it ? only if you do not have an artificial sugar sensitivity . my family seems to enjoy it though , so while i might not purchase this for myself , i probably would for them . . . or someone who does not drink alcohol , but enjoys the taste of mojitos . 
=================
we won't be making the switch we're not soda drinkers in our household , an occasional sprite maybe but otherwise i like to mix club soda with fruit juice when i'm in the mood for something bubbly . this sounded intriguing since it's toted as being all natural . i expected a much less sweet flavor , not that it was bad just that it was very very sweet and candy like . i'm also shocked by the high calories , granted juice in general is high calorie but i was still surprised . my husband really liked the taste and even considered it refreshing so your opinion will likely vary pending what you're accustomed to . not something i would give my 5yr old or reach for again myself . 
=================
formula is fine , but i'm not so sure i'd call it " earth's best " . . . . . . in fact it might just be the exact same formula as your closest local / national grocery store brand but with the added bonus of costing about 30 % more . we had recently been using this formula until we ran out and i had to make an emergency run to the local grocery store for a quick replacement . the closest thing they had was their organic store brand . funny thing is , when i got home to compare the two i noticed the ingredients are exactly the same as well as some of the machine writing on the bottom of the cans where you can find the sell by date . from what i can gather after doing a bit of research the formula ingredients used to be different but have recently changed without letting customers know . virtually all store brand organic formulas come from one manufacturing plant whether you buy it at store x or y and it seems that earth's best is now being produced in this same facility but charging a premium price . i suggest checking this out for yourself , you might be able to save some money . 
=================
poor shipping but helpful customer service . just wanted to add my two cents in defense of the company . i too received a gift box that the glass was broken in , but one call to the company and about a 45 second phone conversation fixed my problem . they sent out a replacement with no hassle whatsoever . 
=================
it tastes like what it is : instant coffee like many of you , i'm tired of paying big bucks for k - cups and when i saw this product on my grocer's shelf , i just had to give it a try . how bad could it be ? well , it tastes just like what it is : a spoonful of instant coffee in a plastic cup that kinda - sorta works in a keurig coffee machine . it's not the most vile thing i've ever tasted , and i'm going to finish the box i purchased , but i won't be buying it again . besides , even if i liked the flavor of this product , it would be more economical to buy a jar of instant and use the keurig to dispense hot water . 
=================
tastes just like any other common honey you might eat the description of this honey says it has a rich unique flavor . mine certainly didn't . it tasted just like the cheapest honey you might find in gallon jugs at your local grocer . and by the way , this jar is only 2oz so it's also very pricey for its size .

'soft baked' is catchier than 'crumbly - blandness' length : : 1 : 09 minsthese cookies have an earthen texture and consistency that conjures up images of the mud pies and beach sand cakes my sons used to make . the ingredients note no less than three preservatives ( tbhq , bht and citric acid ) and nearly as many adjectives as nouns - modified , enriched , bleached , reduced and artificial . ugh . instead of referencing my thesaurus for more words to express the crumbly - blandness of these cookies , i decided to make a short video . i'm sure it better illustrates the appetite - suppressing texture . as for the underwhelming taste , i turned to another resource : my sons ( ages 9 and 8 ) are excellent food critics , albeit not the most discerning ones . i need only leave a plate of food within arm's reach while they play board games , their xbox 360 or watch a movie . snacks like watermelon , popcorn or licorice , disappear quickly . however , both boys passed on the quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie opened for the video review . that sums it up for me . rating : one star . do you need to satisfy a sweet tooth ? i recommend eat . think . smile . crispy thins , sweet cinnamon instead .

davidson's orange spice bulk tea i was really really disappointed with this orange spice tea ! it should be called cinnamon spice tea because that is all you can taste ! orange spiced tea ( constant comment ) is my most favoritest tea . . . so that is why i am s - o - o - o disappointed with davidson's ! ! judging from how great their english breakfast is , i was expecting their orange spice tea to be more orangie and full - bodied than constant comment's ! i also ordered english breakfast , earl grey , and peppermint bulk teas and they are really nice . . . especially the english breakfast , which is quite superior ! ! davidson's tea bulk , orange spice , 16 - ounce bag

not a deal found cheaper pricing at a couple of local stores and 2 of the 6 tubs had busted tops from good 'ol ups doing a number on them . i will just buy from local supermarket from now on .

my cat wouldnt eat filet or shredded my cat hates this type of food . she even lost weight because she wouldnt eat it . so i started buying friskees classic pate canned cat food and she cant get enough of that . she licks the plate dry now ! she also loves dry cat food . who wouldve figured ? but she hates this filet stuff ! what will i do with my 1 1 / 2 cases of prime filet ? 
=================
carb count is now higher ! i was very disappointed that they have now raised the carb count in this cereal from 9 net carbs to 16 net carbs . i have insulin resistance and my nutritionist told me this was the only cereal i could have . it tasted great ! my local shoprite stopped carrying it a while ago because it wasn't selling , so i had to purchase it elsewhere . i called the company and they said they were relaunching it in july . i was so happy to see it back on the shelves , but now they've change it . even the sugar level went up . i just wish there was another cereal on the market that had 9 grams of carbs or less . oh well , i'll surely miss it . 
=================
delicate ! so i got this here turkish delight box . these are in my opinion a step away from your average turkish delight ( not that i am a seasoned t . d . consumer ) but they are more than anything just too soft . . . just like winegum even though they are much easier to chew up if you will , and therefore reminiscent of eating plain candy even though they have a very good quality consitency and taste . these come largely without any nuts inside . . maybe the odd bite though . but the sugar coating is excessive and may upset your tummy . don ` t eat to many of these at any one time . ye be warned ! i think i would try to open them up and maybe let them sit a few days to become dry ? ? ( more chewing resistance ) even maybe try to get wrid of some of that sugar coating ? ! anyway i like the way the box opens . side opening with a nice drawout feature and neatly wrapped in a thin plastic foil . so basically these come plain , with the odd bite with some nuts inside . not my favourite . too little fibre maybe ? 
=================
not quite " dried " peppers . . . i dehydrate many types of peppers and then use a coffee grinder to make a powder out of them . i was expecting to be able to do that with these peppers , but they are not dry enough for that . they are closer in texture to the dried apricots you buy to eat out of hand . sort of leathery and pliant . not a big problem , as i just plopped them on the dehydrator for a day until they were brittle / rock hard , and then ground them up . as a precaution , i set the dehydrator outside on the deck to avoid the fumes . they smell incredible - - a lot like chipotle peppers , actually . i tasted just a tiny bit of some of the outer skin , and it was quite hot . i'm sure with the seeds and veins included when ground , it's going to be flaming . there is a fair amount of rope fibers mixed in with the peppers , but i didn't mind this , as it reminded me that these were dried the old fashioned way - by tying and hanging them up . it just took a little time to pull these threads off as i was placing them on the dehydrator trays . i probably could have not bothered with that and just ground up the fibers with the peppers . i'll add to this review when i find out exactly how much " one pound " of these peppers actually weighs when properly dried . 
=================
too small for tall kitchen size i love these bags , because i can finally compost kitchen scraps without a big mess . but the 13 gallon size is a lot smaller than a polyethelene plastic bag of the same size . it doesnt fit into my 13 gallon trash can , not even close . i'd say the 13 gallon bags are more like 8 gallon bags . perfect for a 5 gallon bucket . 
=================
just alright this product was ok , but due to it's size ( each feeds two ) it does not really work for me . it tastes fine and i will use up what i have for on the go times . 
=================
tomatoes - san marzano i was supposed to receive san marzano brand tomatoes , clearly shown on the cans that was in the advertisement , but the cans didn't specify san marzano . i contacted amazon . com and it made good on my order . they sent me a whole new set of cans of the tomatoes ( although the new cans did not say san marzano on them again ) at no cost to me . 
=================
a very good sweetener , but . . . after using the sweetleaf stevia in packets sweetleaf all natural zero calories steviaplus , 100 packets , 3 . 5 ounce boxes ( pack of 2 ) , i switched to the powder form because i thought it would be more cost effective . it probably is , but i find it is very difficult to dissolve in my hot coffee . for some reason , the sweetleaf stevia in packets dissolved with no clumping or sticking to the spoon or side of the cup . this stevia in the shaker jar sticks to both and is very difficult to mix in . unfortunately i purchased the two pkg deal so will stick it out and then go back to the packets . in the meantime , does anyone have a clue why the two products should react so different ? 
=================
only good if you live in a dry climate poor packaging , air gets in to the zip lock bags the marshmallows are in . fine if you live in colorado springs , terrible if you live in hawaii . i know because i shipped them to co springs when i went to visit ( they don't ship to hi ) , and took them home . the marshmallows all stick together and remoisturize , and while they have the same flavor , they lose that delightful , dehydrated marshmallow texture . 
=================
not really a bargain the jello gets a five star rating , but the price isn't a deal . i didn't do the math before i purchased this from amazon , but i checked my supermarket for its price afterwards . the supermarket sells it for 65 cents , and the amazon price for this item works out to 86 cents a box , so i guess i won't be buying it from amazon again . 
=================
great for handpresso ! i normally purchase the lavazza grand crema pods for use with my breville espresso machine , and have always been happy with them but wanted to try something different , so i ordered a box of espressione classic espresso instead . initially i was very disappointed with the results ; a 30 - second shot of espresso using these pods contained only about half as much liquid as one using my normal lavazza pods ( in other words , the water was passing through these pods at a much slower rate than through the lavazza ) . maybe my machine is lacking in pressure . . . but i could tell just by the feel of the pods that these are much more tightly packed than the lavazza ones . my disappointment changed to delight when i tried these pods out on my handpresso wild , however . i had never really liked the taste of the lavazza pods using this machine ( seemed much more bitter compared to my " real " machine at home ) , but with espressione it was perfect ! bottom line . . . if you are using a handpresso , i recommend these pods 100 % . if you are using a normal espresso machine , you may want to try out a smaller size package before committing to 150 pods . 
=================
great taste , just be ready for it to come out the other end ! i guess i should have read the reviews before buying this for my sister . just like all these other poor sufferers , by sister , her boyfriend and my mom all had severe diarrhea and stomach cramps just a few hours after eating some . this item should have a warning label : " do not eat more than 10 in one sitting unless you you are constipated and need a quick and easy laxative . " too bad they taste so yummy . i'm going back to the sugar ones . 
=================
good product . . . but buy the 700 - ct amazon sells a 700 - ct for $ 15 . . why would i ever pay $ 35 for 1000 - ct ( plus shipping on 1000 - ct ) . . . . seems crazy . look up the 700 - ct and you'll be siked . 
=================
be careful . . . this is pie filling not pure pumpkin received it and realized i messed up by getting the " pie mix " verses the pure pumpkin puree . i had gotten the pure pumpkin of this same brand last time and it made the best tasting pumpkin pie , pumpkin bread and pumpkin pancakes i ever had , hands down . this pie mix has a faint underlying , not quite metalic , flavor that i can't quite describe . it's little better than " libby's " brand but not as good as the pure pumpkin . in fact , i like the pure pumpkin so much better , i've already ordered it and i'm going to bring the 10 ( out of 12 ) cans of the pie mix i haven't used to work and give it away . 
=================
so so all i taste is the chocolate . too much chocolate and not enough raisin . it's like the raisins have 5 coats of chocolate .

a sub - par version of store bought wellness we've been buying this exact formula of wellness for our cocker spaniel " lucy " for over a year now . we thought that it would be worth purchasing on amazon since it was priced almost identically and it would be more convenient than going to petsmart since it would be delivered to our front door . we didn't receive the food for well over a week after we ordered it so we were forced to buy a small bag at the store until we received the food . no big deal . . . we figured next time we'll just order it a couple of weeks in advance so that lucy's food supply isn't as low and we have plenty until we get the next bag . after feeding her two meals of the bag we got from amazon , lucy started having violent diarrhea . i'm familiar with the fact that changing foods can cause an upset stomach with dogs but this is the exact same food we have been feeding her for a very long time . . . . . or so we thought . we knew that the only thing that changed in lucy's diet was the fact that we ordered the food from amazon . so we went and bought another small bag of the same stuff from petsmart . much to our disappointment , there was an obvious difference in the appearance of the food . the bag from amazon had chunks that were misshaped , very porous and even smelled different . our conclusion was that amazon received the reject bags at a discount and sold them as the same product . we then stopped feeding lucy the amazon bag and switched her back to the store bought bag . immediately her bowls improved . although we were refunded for our purchase we had to jump through a few hoops that weren't worth the time we wasted to do so . please reconsider before you purchase this food . wellness is an amazing product and we're proud to feed our little lucy the best food that we possibly can but this is not up to the quality that wellness is known for . i'm going to post pics of both the amazon bought food and the store bought food so that you can see the difference .

not for drinking this tea is really quite a low - grade matcha . it's fine for cooking , but for drinking it's really not great . also , it's priced quite high even at the sale price . 
=================
ok organic , ok . with the shipping , this product can be found cheaper in local markets . not sure what they have for the picture , since this product looks like a deep , dark orange powder , not a green grain .

exactly where is the chai in this tea ? i love having chai at home , so i purchased this tea at a local store . this is perhaps the most bland chai i've ever had . this is really a " miss " on the part of twinings . hopefully they will have the common sense to listen to customers and restore this product to the original indian spice chai .

e150a water best described as a mix of urine and white wine . this is one of the worst blended whiskys on the market . berry bros & rudd dumped this brand on to the edrignton group in 2010 . as part of the terms , bb & r received rights to the glenrothes brand . bb & r wins ! one has to wonder why it took them so long . bb & r also produce a fine blended whisky called blue hanger . . . great stuff but impossible to find in the us . avoid cutty sark !

habanero are hotter then these i was very cautious and cut off a small corner of the pepper and set it on my tongue to see what they tasted like . i was very surprised that it wasn't that " hot " that i was expecting , and that they are rather sweet . i would almost say that these are cayenne peppers if not for the sweet taste to them . though these aren't all that hot , they still go great in chili ! only 2 stars because they taste great . just not hot at all to me . 
=================
not the large ones ! there is nothing you could say that would make an atomic fireball be bad ! ! i was disappointed though that these are the little ones , not the larger ones you typically see . my fault for not asking !

i hope you're happy . i recently gave up drinking soda and have been searching for a calorie - free alternative . i'm a big fan of tea2go , but like most sweet - tasting mixes it has splenda in it . so even though i've replaced my diet pepsi addiction with watered down tea , i still feel a little guilty about it . so when eboost came along i thought it was a perfect opportunity to inject some vitamins into my diet . and , let me tell you , eboost sure did . i just didn't expect it to blast those vitamins through my tongue and out the back of my skull . you see , the folks who produce eboost believe that more is better . and therefore , something that's good for you in large quantities is even better . and while we're at it , why not just multiply the good stuff by a thousand , because hey , how can it hurt , right ? i take a daily multivitamin already and even the efficacy of a multivitamin is questioned by the fda . the reason being that different minerals are absorbed by the body differently , and often require fat in your diet ( usually at the time of consumption ) to be absorbed along with the vitamin . in other words , just sucking down a vitamin with water isn't going to do you much good . and , in case it's not clear that this review is going down the toilet , dumping thousands of milligrams of certain vitamins into your system is going to pass right through you . don't tell eboost that . eboost has 1 , 000 mg of vitamin c , which is 1 , 667 % the daily recommended value . let me repeat : one thousand six hundred and sixty seven percent of the daily recommended value . and here i thought i was okay drinking a glass of orange juice in the morning ! i drank a full eight ounces of water with eboost and i'm surprised my head hasn't exploded already . in fact , the only vitamin that eboost doesn't include insanely high amounts of is potassium at just 14 % of the daily recommended value , because that would reduce the efficacy of the 2 , 500 mcg of vitamin b12 . do you know how much of the recommended b12 daily value that is ? 41 , 667 % . i read the label twice : forty one thousand six hundred and sixty seven percent of the daily recommended value . a quick search of several health sites explains how ridiculous this amount is . " vitamin b12 supplements do not appear to improve energy or athletic performance , except in people with a vitamin b12 deficiency . " please folks - if you want to take care of these fragile bodies of ours , drink plenty of water , eat healthy , and exercise . there is no magic formula that will make you healthier except a healthy lifestyle . there are plenty of other ways to get your vitamins , but eboost isn't it . also , it tastes like metal shavings off a dirty muffler mixed in with an orange rind . but i have only myself to blame - - eboost fizzes when you pour it into water . that's nature's way of telling you not to drink it . 
=================
excellent cracker , but doesn't survive shipping i first ran into this cracker at aj's fine foods ( a local grocery ) . these crackers taste great and have a generous amount of rosemary on each cracker ( when it hasn't fallen off the cracker ) . i recently ordered a pack of 6 boxes from amazon and found the same problem that most of the boxes in the local grocery had . each box * should * have several large crackers the size of the box . but the large crackers don't seem to survive shipping / handling either from amazon or to the local grocery and so what is in the boxes are lots of cracker pieces ranging from 1 / 2 cracker size to pieces the size of a quarter . plus , most of the rosemary has fallen off , so each box has about a tablespoon of the spices that should be on the crackers at the bottom of the bag . a real shame - - i hope the company figures out a way to produce these so that they survive transport , because they are great crackers . the boxes which were shipped from amazon were boxed well ( i don't believe this is an amazon specific problem ) . i won't be buying any more of these online , since even the ones in the stores require visual inspection if you want crackers instead of pieces of crackers . 
=================
excellent product , but be careful ! i bought this grass for my very picky ( tortoiseshell ) cat and she loved it . every time she walked through the room she would either rub her face on the plant or take a few bites . if i so much as dared to touch it while she was nearby she would swat my hand away ! and she's an indoor / outdoor cat , so it isn't like this is her only option for fiber either . i say " be careful " because after about two weeks i noticed she stopped eating it , then by the third week it was all wilted and brown . i'm no greenthumb by any means , but it seems i should have used a free draining pot ( like the instructions say to do . . . i'm just an idiot ) instead of the opaque , closed - bottom one i chose . it turns out i had the grass swimming , and when i dumped out the pot it was probably the foulest smelling mush on earth . i had to open all my windows and run the attic fan to clear out the stench ! that's not the product's fault at all , hence five stars . in fact , i'm about to reorder and start a new batch since she liked it so much . i'm just throwing this review up here so other inexperienced growers like me can hopefully avoid the same mistake !

near best but so many are so good there is good and bad aspects . most conspicuous is that too much water comes through in twenty seconds . double fills more than half a regular coffee cup with 22 sec . brews . too watery ? rules are relative in my world . i could brew shorter times for 2oz doubles but i don't . this tastes so good even with the extra water . tiny bit of sugar and none i like better . always trying lots of different expressos although i avoid any @ $ 10 / lb and above . costco had a sulawesi estate 2 . 5lb for $ 12 ( close ? ) close second to lavazza . beans not pods so less convenient . went through 7 . 5lbs selawesi then gone . waiting for return ? been brewing espresso for twenty plus years and pretty fast at it so grinding with my rocky is easy . so , its a little watery so what ? it tastes good , really good . been around a long time and huge following . guess their bean mix is big secret . it is soft , smooth , mild , low acid , imho lucaffe classic 150 pods also good . stronger more acid and heck the red package is pretty . lots of local and national brands and flavors . some seem to get into the " get what you pay for " or " if it cost more it is better " hoping it appeals to baser instincts . if you can pay $ 10lb and do it again and again with no thought to cost let's drink yours , lolflavor for cost and convenience puts this pod lavazza gran crema high on my list of favorites . since you can brew pods why not try that variety pack and see what you like ? almost all of them are excellent and some are acceptable none were bad that i can remember . several from that sampler can be bought like this lavazza offer . i have consumed two or three of these 150 lavazza boxes . mixing with beans and other pods each 150 box lasted about a year . when i am tired , it's late , and i think of it , i reach for a couple lavazza pods for quick and easy espresso . price on this varies . first paid about $ 41 and now $ 51 . sorry just noticed price went up in last week to $ 55 . seen it for $ 60 + for 150 pods . they are sealed so no hurry to consume . only fresh beans make crema like pods . one week and flavor begins to taper with slightly finer grinds required to maintain 22sec brews with most coffee beans . never tried to figure the cost per pound equivalent with pods . maybe i don't want to know , lol

high fructose corn syrup has recently been added to what was once an excellent product . also the ingredients list . n surprisingit seems high fructose corn syrup has recently been added to what was once an excellent product . also the ingredients list which was previously readable now needs a magnifying glass why you would add this as sugar is already present ?

bad reaction i bought this product on the strength of the reviews but after one or two days of taking it i had a bad reaction to it including dizziness and the onset of depression and anxiety . someone mentioned that maca is a strong her and made their heart race a little after taking it . another person said their skin broke out in a rash . yet another reviewer mentioned alphalpha - which this product has and which is meant to be bad for some reason ( i'll do the research later ) my only interpretation personally for me as to why my body reacted to it is the chemical additives e . g silica which is a well known neurotoxin . i have a very sensitive central nervous system and thought i would take this to get essential nutrients . but i think the multiple combinations and the large quantities of each herb / veg was just too much . i have since binned it and i'm scared to ever try it again . since then i've bought a juicer and juice cabbage , cucumber , carrots , celery and other veg everyday and that's worked out much better for me in terms of boosting my energy , memory and concentration than this nightmare powder did .

dont hestitate to order these vanilla beans ! ! ! ! i wanted some vanilla beans to make my own vanilla flavoring . the price of vanilla beans was very high in my small east texas town and they did not look that fresh . after reading reviews on amazon of these beans i decided to purchase them . wow ! when i opened the package the smell was unbelievable and the beans were not dried out . i was very impressed and would order these again ! 
=================
only ate if hand fed i was expecting slightly better ingredients . i did not expect for the majority of the ingredients to be fillers ; i expected proteins . dogs are omnivores leaning to the carnivore end of the spectrum . the package was shipped in an appropriately sized box and had air pillows to minimize crushing . not receiving dog food dust was nice . i was disappointed in the product packaging itself . there was supposed to be a zippered seal , but the sliding mechanism was missing . now my pantry reeks of dog food . now , the most important part . . . did my dog like beneful ? yes , if i hand fed her or if she were truly hungry . she seemed to prefer the soft bits , digging around the others to eat them first . plus , i have to stay with her while she eats to encourage ( trick ) her into eating . sigh , i have better things to do than beg my dog to eat . 
=================
reforming junk food addict you might as well eat the box it came in . if it weren't for the almonds , it would have no taste at all . it's too fine to eat dry as a snack , and too solid to eat with cold milk as a cereal . i imagine it would be a decent substitute for granola in a fruit and yogurt parfait , but i haven't tried it that way yet . but remember , it's healthy .

be prepared to wear it ! oh heck no , not happy at all . i have used the similar mio water enhancers , and enjoy them . they are only 1 . 6 oz bottles , and this is 12 ounces . obviously you need to shake this , then though for some reason they want you to store it upside down , you turn it up and flip open the cap . on my first attempt , the bright red liquid shot out freely , spilled all over the place and stained everything it touched , including my now ruined shirt . i wiped it off the floor , counter and walls , cleaned , and then took the closed bottle and washed it under water . i blamed it on user error , and was more cautious on my next attempt . but , before you even turn it over it starts coming out . dare to actually squeeze it , you get too much , and some of it might end up in the glass if you're lucky . so , once you are out of energy after cleaning the mess , once again , you take a sip and now can't describe what you are drinking . it just tastes like plastic to me . reading the ingredients , i have no idea what is causing the plastic taste , so it must be the plastic bottle . the taste is eventually tolerable , but not so much . the mio bottle is ten times smaller and lasts longer , with better taste . but honestly , this is the stupidest bottle i have ever seen . do not store on it's lid as it will spill all over your fridge . i have it upright in a can holder . if you have kids , forget it . you will be cleaning this up endlessly .

swheatscoop for rabbits one of my rabbits found the swheat scoop irresistable to eat and an impacted stomach has resulted with my rabbit now being in the hospital for the last few days , with this litter impaction located in her stomach . subsequently i found out on a quick web search that there is information on this product and its detriment to rabbits , on the hrs , house rabbit society website , as well as several other online locations . i'm certain this product is great for cats however , and i would continue to use it for my cat if i didn't have rabbits .

health inspectors close restaurant serendipity 3 frrrozen hot chcolate mix gift package and several packs of the hot chocolate mix . in october , 2007 i purchased the gift set along with several packs of the hot chocolate mix to be used as stocking stuffers at christmas . sometime in late november or early december i read a very short article in our local paper that read : " health inspectors close restaurant " " while serendipity may be the art of finding pleasant things by chance , what health inspectors found at celebrated eatery serendipity 3 was not very agreeable . " " officials closed the restaurant wednesday night after it failed its second inspection in a month . an inspector spotted a live mouse and mouse droppings , fruit flies , house flies and more than 100 live cockroaches . " " both inspections revealed rodent and fly infestation and conditions conducive to pest infestation , including stagnant water in the basement , the department said . " needless to say , approximately $ 60 of hot chocolate mix was thrown away . i would never purchase any products from serendipity 3 again , even if it was a " must have " by oprah . if there were a half star or less , it would be rated for this product . 
=================
great but way too expensive i can't believe the price increase on this product from the last time i bought it ! they've tripled - yes , really tripled - the price . won't be buying it here anymore , since i can get it at a local supermarket for less than what they charge now .

strongest k - cup coffee out there this fog chaser was available at my local grocery store . i thought i would give it a try . well let me tell you , even on the highest setting this cup is strong . reminds me of a regular pot of dark communittee coffee . if you think the regular k - cups are just too weak , give this a try and you won't be disappointed .

works for a minute . . . gives you pain for hours i never drink energy drinks . i'm in college and all of my friends drink them like they are water . i never got the point of it . but today it was 2 pm i could barely keep my eyes open and i had class from 3 : 30 till 9 : 00 . i needed energy and fast . then the commercial for 5 - hour energy popped in my head , " 2 : 30 feeling " i knew some of my friends used it , so i thought why not give it a try . i figured it was small so it wouldn't do that much harm . i drank half of the bottle and within minutes i know longer felt like i was falling asleep . unfortunately 10 minutes later i was feeling more tired than before . i decided to drink the rest of the bottle . once again a quick 5 minute burst of energy and then back to exhaustion . then everything got worse . around an hour after drank the drink i found myself doubling over in stomach pain and throwing up . it has been 7 hours since i drank it and i feel like i just got hit by a train . instead of helping me get through class the 5 - hour energy made it nearly impossible .

petowners beware dog food has changed alot over the past few years . as pet owners were willing to spend more money feeding their pets , larger corporations bought out the smaller dog food companies and changed the ingredients without notifying the customers . this was particularly true of the more expensive brands that contained the higher quality ingredients . real meat and rice were substituted with " meat by - product " and cheap imported grains ( particularly corn ) that were determined to be " unfit for human consumption " . they are taking ingredients that used to be considered " waste " and packaging it up as " healthy & nutritious " food for your beloved pet . our once healthy pets are contracting debilitating diseases and dying because of the toxic waste materials that are currently being marketed as pet food . blue buffalo is one of the few remaining companies that , at least to my knowledge , has not " sold - out " yet . the food really is nutritious and still contains real meat with no by - products , fillers , corn or soy . we switched our dogs over this past summer after having lost one to an autopsy / toxicology verified case of " aflatoxin poisoning " from the " healthy & nutritious " dog food we were buying and feeding him . this was not cheap food folks . this was a well - known brand , highly marketed as " natural " , that we were paying $ 60 / bag for . the fda analysis of this food verified that it contained toxins , but nothing was done to the dog food manufacturer . they are still producing their " high priced waste " and heavily marketing it as " natural " . my advice to pet owners : read the ingredients labels thoroughly and often ! blue buffalo a great product that you can still feed your pets with confidence . because it doesn't contain any cheap fillers , it's more satisfying to your dog so you don't need to feed as much of it thus making it still relatively economical . don't wait until it's too late for your beloved pet .

i love these , but please make them in the us ! i love these . i mean , i really love them . and i was about to order them , but out of curiosity glanced down at the reviews . mrs . may , i hope you read these reviews ! i will be one of your faithful customers forever if you start making these in the us . i choose not to buy any products ( especially food ) made in china , because of 2 concerns : 1 . human rights issues and the use of prisoners as unpaid laborers ( this is why the price is cheap on chinese - made goods ) and 2 . concerns for quality control .

tastes like what i imagine food in hell would taste like ! i work out every day and i've choked down the newest protein powders that tastes like chalk . i eat tomatoes chopped up on food even though i hate them . so after the first bite and that sudden wtf realization that this tasted nothing like apples or cinnamon i figured i would just trod through it . my gag reflex had other plans ! ( i just burped and almost threw up again ! ) i'd like to find what ever taste tester at cytosport ok'd this flavor and punch him or her in the crotch ! i tried to give it to my dogs ( they are the left over cleaner uppers ) and they looked at me like i was holding a club in my hand ! they lick their own butts ( one of the dogs used to eat from the cats' litter box ) and they wouldn't come near it ! they must be smarter than me because i figured that i'd try a second container with whole milk instead of water . so much for bigger brain = smarter . i am going to try to feed the last four containers ( uncooked ) to the squirrels outside and see if they will eat it . have you heard the saying " anticipation of death is worse than death itself " ? well i have six containers of their maple / brown sugar as well . and i am not too manly to admit that i am scared , yes scared , to try one ! ( burped again , choking back bile ! ) i just ate a piece of bread slathered in mustard to block the taste . so in summary , avoid this stuff like rat poison ! i may yet call the poison control hotline . if you don't see a review of the maple / brown sugar flavor in the next week , call 911 for me !

be careful i bought these treats at petsmart for my older dogs . one dog is a 100lb amstaff and the other is a 100lb great dane / black lab / gsd mix and both are 11 years old . i was looking for treats that are made in america and that were softer than rawhides because their teeth aren't as strong as they used to be , but they still love to chew . well , when i was out in the yard scooping this weekend i discovered that these treats are not being digested . at all . in addition , both of my dogs have thrown up chunks of these treats over the past week . one earlier this week and one today . this from two dogs who have never had stomach issues in the past . i'd be very careful about giving these ( or the peanut butter flavor ) to your dogs . it's nice that they're made from natural ingredients and are made in the usa , but if they can't be digested then they're not worth buying .

uh oh this shampoo has a silky , smooth texture and a clean , fresh smell . however . after about a half dozen washes , my scalp started to itch like crazy . no shampoo has ever done that to me before . after reading the other amazon . com reviews i notice at least one other user had skin problems with this shampoo . fair warning : it's not for everyone .

straight sugar cheaper to buy a bag of sugar & eat it with a spoon ! fruit is diced in small pieces so forget tasting anything but sweet - - as in candied . no potential health benefits here .

ineffective if you are pondering whether or not to purchase this product - first mostly , do your research . the reviews on this state some insects were caught - however , some say they weren't effective . just take a moment and realize that yes , they cost cheap - however , did you know that they use pheromone technology ? did you know that pheromone's only work on certain types of insects ? for instance , sure you can get a pheromone to attract women but however , only a few women will respond to the pheromone product for women . this concludes that pheromones that this product contains is less effective with certain insects . if your home is infested with centipedes and home spiders - the best recommendation that has worked for my wife and i is raid barrier . it's very effective and over for a past week we seen dramatic results in the reduction amount of spiders and centipedes . you may have greater results by spraying raid around the outside and some inside ( isolated rooms ) . do yourself a favor and pass this product up and go now purchase raid barrier . works like a charm and will keep your home safe and comfortable .

great idea - smaller package stays fresh longer this little change makes all the difference in ensuring that your graham crackers stay fresh longer . there are 8 - squares in each sealed package . i often found that after opening a traditional package , all the crackers would not be eaten in one sitting and when the kids would go back for more a few days later , they would already begin to taste a bit stale . since each package can easily be a snack for 2 - kids , i no longer have this problem . the smaller package also seems to travel better with less crumbs getting scattered when i'm serving them . although i prefer the fresh stacks when traveling due to the smaller size , the packaging certainly isn't " crush proof . " frankly , it's the same type of waxy wrapper that contains the rectangular graham crackers so you need to handle the package with care or many of your crackers will be crushed . in other words , this package isn't something you'd throw in your kid's book bag for snack unless they like a lot of crumbs because they'd be pulverized to dust before they got to school . overall however , i really like the packaging idea and i'd definitely always buy the square stacks over the rectangular packaging providing there is no price difference . 
=================
positive be sure if you're purchasing the pump to get this as well . received pkg promptly and it was packed well . 
=================
melted in transit , taste great despite having melted and re - solidified in transit , they taste great . still , they have to be scraped off the wrapper , so it's a bit of a pain to enjoy them .

for relaxed or natural hair ( african american ) i see tons of bad reviews on here and i would have to say they are very wrong . this is more so for african american hair . and we need the moisture to keep our hair healthy . we are not washing it everyday and this stays in your hair . that's what we want . i really like this product . you can apply it directly to the scalp or you can put it in your hair and rub on your hair . the smell is lovely . doesn't smell like old school grease ! if you want a great product to add to the mix , i would suggest using this .

tea is terrific but amazon dropped the ball tetley decaffeinated greet tea is the best tasting tea i have found . when i ordered it on amazon through their subscription program , they sent one box of tea , not a pack of six . for $ 22 + that was very expensive tea . they refilled the order and again only one box of tea was sent . i'm not comfortable trying to order it again . i look forward to hearing of other people who placed their orders and did receive a pack of 6 boxes of tea for this order . amazon refunded my purchase price and let me keep the two boxes of tea by the way . the only reason i gave this one star was because of the order fulfillmet problems . amazon is terrific and tetley tea is the best . phyllis @ gr8findsonline

doberman loves it first off , if you compare the price of this by weight to regular food that is loaded with corn and rice , don't . my dogs eat about 1 / 2 as much of this food because there is actual nutrition in this and not a bunch of filler . i slowly cycled this food into their old food , because it's quite a change and if you don't your dog could be making awful messes . imagine not eating red meat for a month and then slamming a big ol' steak . i went with the fish and potato because my doberman has some skin issues . the dry skin cleared up after a while . for some reason none of the dogs will eat the black bits in the food . there aren't a lot of them , but i think it's odd . the only thing i really don't like about this food is the smell . if you don't close the bag up tight it can smell very fishy around it , and your dogs breath will smell a little fishy after they eat it . other than that the pooches seem happy . 
=================
there are better options it isn't a bad product and if you are using a lot it is cheaper : however , there are better options . it is a little acidic and less sweet than other products . i've found it locally that is only twice the price . great if you add a little sugar . 
=================
loriann the flavor is good but the pasta is way past al dente . mushy really . this is something i would only eat if there was nothing else available . i like a lot of the other dinners in this product line . 
=================
not too bad these peach rings are pretty decent . the flavor is a bit too sweet , but overall ok . sadly , these were not sour as i had thought they were . 
=================
better choices for your loved one please dont buy dog food with corn as the main ingredient . . . they cant digest it . . . . and it will pass it through . . . . spend a little more and you will be glad you did . . . . . . as in less dog waste . . . . better fur and a happy full dog . . . with a little internet research a 20 # bag will cost about $ 5 more . . . . . is it worth it to you ? ? ? ?

not very healthy ? my son loves these milks and we used to get them for him when we went to starbucks . i was familiar with the horizon brand and thought that the vanilla flavor would be fine . i began to notice a few times after drinking this he would say his tummy hurt or he would act sick ( really tired ) shortly after drinking them . i read the label and saw 29g of sugar . . . yeah holy cow ! when we serve him a flavored milk i give him gerbers smart sips , they have vanilla and mild vanilla flavor with 11g of sugar , i think the mild vanilla has even less grams of sugar . he still loves the taste too ! i find them in the babyfood aisle at the grocery store .

look before u eat ! ! ! ! ! ! mold problem ! ! ! ! ! purchased here but later ordered factory direct w / other flavors i couldnt find here . very blueberry taste & moist . as a curiosity , i e - mailed a request in regards to spoilage / preserving & got a very prepared , non - answer , statement " . . . all natural , blah , blah . . . . " from general mills ( guess they run the show ) . when i replied , asking for better info = no response . never had issues w / order from amazon but the later order direct from lara bar became covered with white fuzz ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i wonder how many bars i ate without looking ! also , if these were factory sealed & fresh , i assume the mold was inside the product from the start ! fyi , the mold developed 4 months before expiration date & at stable temps ~ 65 - 68 deg . i called re the issue & gave them all the info . sorry . . adv the quality team . . send coupon . . normal reaction . cust service rep was going to send a coupon to cover the $ for another . i mentioned the shipping price so she said she would send more . problem is she sent coupons for store purchases . will see how / if i remember to order by mail ! no internet credit , etc . no one sells lara bars in central wisconsin . also , the coupons she sent wont cover freight & aren't for a 16 count box ! ! ! just a bunch of stuff . this 1 - star is for general mills c / s ( kinda stupid ) & the mildew / mold . no issues w / other lara products - they are excellent

pet unable to chew these munchy sticks were so hard that my dog could not even chew on them . i gave them to some friends that have a much larger dog and he could not chew them . we soaked them in water and still could not get them anywhere near soft or munchy . sorry for the poor review .

standard kefir directions do not work with this product when i received this product it came with the wrong directions , but hey , in this modern day the internet can fix this situation . . . except that it can't . i tried several you tube videos , many blogs , they all seemed to have the same directions for milk kefir grains . these directions did not work for my purchased grains , and i did try a number of times . i gave up because who really has the time to trouble shoot something that should be very simple . after being contacted by the seller ( who seems concerned and helpful ) i learned that with this product you really have to let the seller guild you through the process , hold your hand , because their grains are just that much more potent then anyone elses . also , you shouldn't expect to be able to drink more then 1 / 2 a cup every week or two because these grains are just that potent . . . . of course after 4 rounds in milk my grains didn't grow . . . so maybe mine weren't that potent . in the end i didn't have a lot of time to commit to dealing with lifetime kefir . if you want yummy digestible kefir instead of milk in your smoothies and on your granola do not buy this , buy another product , with instructions , that seems to match other's opinions of what kefir's potency should be for someone who enjoys it . but if you do have the time and you don't like to drink a lot of kefir but want the benefits this is perfect for you . the seller is very responsive and helpful and very concerned with your happiness . but you do have to take the time to have a conversation over email instead of just looking up the solution yourself .

i think it's awesome ! i'm what you may call a cream soda buff . i love it , it's always been my favorite flavor . . . and no soda will taste quite as good as the cane sugar varieties , but i'm sort of on a caloric budget , and cannot afford to go drinking all my calories . i love this stuff . it's great , perhaps it's an aquired taste , but i've been drinking naturally diet sodas for over a year , and i was so excited to try the cream soda version . i prefer it over all the other flavors ( i haven't tried grape yet , that's my next priority ) . i tried a few other brands of stevia and xylitol flavored cream sodas and none of them match up to this one . i say it's definitely worth a try . * * * * update ( 8 / 8 / 2011 ) * * * i'm irritated . i'm not mad at the product , it's still delicious ; but when i got the package i ordered from amazon . com , it had been through a lot . it was smashed on one side , and sure enough , 3 of the sodas were ruined , had exploded all over the other sodas , and many had been deformed due to some horrific accident . amazon . . . i have never had such a horrible problem from you before , but this is my first food purchase . it makes me very unlikely to order another food especially beverage package again , and i'm a pretty frequent customer . i wish you would make it right . i realize it may have been the mail carrier , but perhaps amazon needs to package the beverages better or put a fragile sign on it or something . just a suggestion . sad day for my delicious cream sodas .

love those suzie's i love suzie's flatbreads ! i had some from another store and they quit carrying them , so i ordered them through amazon .

food particle gets stuck in handle at first i was so excited about the beaba ! i even called all my friends and raved about it . now after 10 months of use , i don't like to use it anymore . why ? well because food particles end up stuck in the handle . the handle is made hallow so that the water can travel to the container and " steam " the food . this is a great idea , however , the beaba designers forgot one very important aspect : you can't remove the handle and take it apart to clean ! food particles get stuck in the handle and there is no way to clean . i am a clean freak and i have tried everything to clean the handle . i even used toothpick to get into the small opening of the handle , but nothing worked . i now use a mini food processor and even if i have to steam veggies or fruit separately , the mini food processor is much stronger , can puree faster and make the food smoother . so yes , i loved it at first , but now i have fallen out of love . i used my beaba daily , so maybe if you won't use yours much , then , it might be a good choice , but if you plan to use it daily and plan to use it for a while , you will see what i mean about the little pieces of food stuck in the handle . 
=================
not a very good food . my view of this product has changed since we have been feeding halo ; the cats seem healthier and happier . the kitten's coat was getting very rough and now is smooth and silky . i'm told that you should feed the best you can afford , and this food is expensive , but not very high - quality , as far as we could tell . plus , our kitten gained too much weight on it .

blaahh i absolutely love irish cream coffee from any cafe i've ever gone to . so naturally when i got my keurig a couple months ago , i tried this one out since it was a great price . i guess there is a reason timothys is cheaper ! ! this coffee has a nice irish cream smell , but the taste is weak and bland . the rest of their coffee is nothing special either . 
=================
happy with the product but expiring soon ! ! i bought this so i can pack single serve soy milk on my almost 2 day flight across the atlantic for my toddler who is allergic to milk . it worked well but i just noticed that it expires in less than 6 weeks from when i placed my order ! ! ! i wished that that information was listed because i will not be able to finish it before it expires . what a waste ! ! : ( 
=================
watch out for the lid on these things . my low star rating is not for the product inside the can , but for the packaging . i loathe the smoothpull lids on this brand of low sodium tuna . i would have given the product one star , but the tuna inside is tasty , so two stars . unfortunately , to get to the tuna - which , again i say , is tasty , flaky and you'd never guess was missing any sodium ( and it really is low sodium , for canned tuna anyway , the nutritional data can attest to that ) - you have to deal with the smoothpull top ( patent pending ) . these lids are designed so that once you pull up the tab , you can supposedly just give it a light tug and the thing pops right off , no peeling required . let me tell you , the lid does not just pop right off . it flies off like it was spring loaded . most of the time i wind up dodging a spray of juice and bits of food when i open these suckers , but this latest time i actually cut myself . these lids are sharp ! so i'm going back to my old sodium rich brand of tuna unless i can find a low sodium brand with an old - fashioned lid on it . you don't always have to reinvent the wheel .

saw good reviews . made my puppy sick this product came highly recommended by my friends and the vet so i decided to purchase a 30lb . bag for my 6 month old puppy . i fed it to her the first day i got it after inspecting the good 'til date and for any contamination . within a few hours , she had blood in her diarrhea after i took her for a walk . my dog has never had diarrhea in the month that i've had her . on top of that , she was constantly gassy throughout the day after being fed this product . on my 2nd walk with her , she had diarrhea again despite not being fed anything after the first episode . i took her off the food and her stool returned to normal . i fed this to her again today and she's passed liquid stool once more and is extremely lethargic and gassy right now . amazon was nice enough to take care of my problem , but this item needs to be pulled . after my pup's issues , i did some more additional research and found many consumer complaints filed with consumer affairs regarding several of natural balance's product including this one . it's possible that i received a bad bag , but i don't know . . . . i'm just really bothered by the similarities between my experience and what other's have posted .

feline fantasia catnip pellets these pellets are the cats' meow ! i sew about a dozen of them into little squares of old t - shirt material and toss them out for the cats to play with . all three of our indoor cats , as well as our outdoor feral kitty truly enjoy them . . even more than traditional catnip flakes . my cats give two paws up !

kind of a miss i love sweet tea and i am not even a southerner . there is something special about sweet tea that when it is mixed right , it tastes wonderful . unfortunately , this sweet tea concentrate missed the mark . first of all , the package was leaking upon arrival . not too much to return the product . when i opened it , the mixture had an artificial candy - like scent . okay , it is suppose to be sweet . the big problem was the instructions . " just a few drops . " huh ? not to be overly anal but do you mean short drops or long drops . is a few 3 , 4 , 5 , or more ? without a clear measurement , it is hard to find that " sweet spot " . mcdonalds use a syrup concentration such as this one ( i assume ) and the flavor is always consistent . that is important to me . if they want to improve on the product , add something like ¼ teaspoon per 8 oz water or something similar . otherwise , if you want to experiment with getting just the right ratio of mix to water , have at it . i don't have time and if i did , chances are i would never get it perfect again . 
=================
quality product but not great taste i was disappointed in this tea , expecting more of a sweet spicy orange flavor but finding it to be just overall sour with very little spice shining through . i have tried it sweetened and unsweetened . i have steeped it for longer and shorter periods . it is palatable in all cases but never very good . i do find that if i steep it for a short period of time and add a little sweetener that helps reduce the sour taste , but then it is just rather bland . 
=================
mentos sugarfree chewing gum i did not like this product , but it is because i don't like chewing gum . i wanted the sugarfree mints but they were , and are , still unavailable , so i thought i would give it a try . i would love to have the sugarfree mints , not the gum . 
=================
would love to say it worked i am a mother who had been successfully exclusively breastfeeding for over three months . i noticed my supply was getting less and less and was told by a couple of people said to try this herb . as i said in the title , i really would love to say it worked for me , but after taking this product , as directed , in hopes of boosting my milk supply , it failed to deliver . i am not saying it may not work for others , but all it did for me was make me smell like maple syrup , and not in a good way . maybe it will work for you as it has for others . 
=================
never a disappointment frickin' yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm . if you have never had a jelly belly you haven't eaten good jelly beans . amazon prices the best

these just don't do it for me as breath mints to me , these are nothing like the regular altoids and are not breath mints . they are pleasant - tasting little candies in a cute convenient tin , and that's as far as it goes . the mintiness is just not strong , and the wintergreens are definitely weaker than the peppermint minis . i'm not a dragon - breath person , but still , one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my breath . four or five will freshen my breath for a short while - maybe 15 minutes . at this point , i think the icebreakers frost mints are the best as sugar free breath mints . 
=================
should be better in the spring i really should have been more patient . maple season isn't for a few more months so i'm not surprised that the candy tasted somewhat stale ( the sugar had hardened in some spots ) and was a little bit grainy ( felt like not all of the sugar had fully dissolved ) . still enjoyable with a mild maple flavor .

why won't anyone eat the green ones ? can anyone explain why none of the adults on my staff , who happily gobble these up during meetings , won't eat the green ones ? i can understand it with kids - but with people 34 - 65 ? ? ? ? please add more pineapple life savers to the package and win my staff's hearts ! what more can i say ? they're life savers .

5 stars silk - 0 stars on expiration silk is great stuff , and these aseptic packages are supposed to be good for a year . that doesn't do much good when there is less than 2 months left on the product when received . i stocked up for the winter in case we can't get to town to buy fresh . ordering silk via amazon is a bogus shopping experience ; they can't be returned because 'technically' there is nothing wrong with the product . 5 stars if you're drinking it next week . 0 stars if you're stocking up for 6 months from now .

excellent balsamic vinegar at an amazingly low price . to be honest , for the price , this is very good balsamic vinegar . i know that the price is rather low for quality vinegar and i was a bit leery of that aspect being a firm believer in that you get what you pay for . in this case that old saying just did not apply . as inexpensive as this is , the quality is actually quite high . i use quite a lot of this stuff in my cooking and a very large number of my salad dressings have this as an ingredient . it would take an extremely sophisticated taste to tell this product from the more expensive vinegars and for everyday cooking i find that this manicardi # 12 more than fits the bill . frankly , i was rather amazed at what i got for my money here . like all balsamic vinegars , it takes a bit of experience to know where the cut off point is and where too much is too much . . . this product is no exception to that rule . a light hand at first is the best policy . i highly recommend this . you get the taste you want , the essence , without having to sell off an expensive piece of jewelry each time you cook or whip a salad into being . 
=================
not much better than i the salmon flavored one . obviously , any dog's reaction to various foods are dependent on their own allergies . i switched from wellness simple salmon because of the fishy smell of the food and my pit / lab's fishy breath . if it wasn't for the fishy breath , i would have kept him on it . i was actually very pleased with the results of that food . i decided to switch to the duck flavor hoping that his breath would improve . his breath for sure has improved and has been normal for a dog , but he has had diarrhea and loose stool on it since we put him on it for the past 4 weeks . he has also been biting his paws and itching more than he had been on the salmon flavor . we have had to mix 1 / 2 a cup of the duck flavor with boiled chicken , rice , and sweet potato in order for his stools to return to normal . but at any time we feed him just this dog food , he will have extremely watery diarrhea . quite disappointed with this and would definitely recommend purchasing a small bag first to see if your dog can tolerate it . not quite sure what we're gonna do next . we might have to put our hyper allergic pit / lab mix on a homemade diet because that seems like the only thing that works for him .

works , sort of well , it attracts moths well , as indicated by the " powder " marks on the tape . on the other hand , it has yet to trap even one of them . i think i can hear them laughing at me right now .

price ? nothing is wrong with the product but the price is stupid for a condament . it's not a meal just something you add to a meal . it shouldn't be almost $ 7 a jar . i will only buy it when it's on sale . i use mayo , which by the way has no flavor . but it's very rare for me to use mayo , just don't like the taste .

coffee pods what a great price on the coffee pods . however , after opening the bag i found 1 or more pods had broken open and i had a big mess to deal with . is that the reason for the sale price . was this shipment damaged in the factory . i don't think it is fair to the customer to find that out on his own . i probably won't buy anymore coffee from amazon .

a step above a rice cake ! after reading the reviews you would have thought this was a great tasting product ! right ? it's a step above a plain rice cake with a few mini chocolate chips ! that's it ! i read all the review and thought this was a no brainer and i purchased 4 boxes . i gave a few to my office associates and got their opinion too ! when you open of package it smells like dark mocha . when you bite into it we thought it had no flavor and at best was like a plain rice cake ! one person thought it tasted like " dirt " . and after thinking about it a while i agree ! dry texture and dry mocha flavor . well , you be the judge . i think all the positive reviews were from those who have been locked up for a while and recently released or those who think rice cakes are delicious ! ! 
=================
not a time or effort saver i wish i had thought about this purchase a little longer . it takes a large space to work on the sifting , the clumps have to be dumped from a large container into a trash bag , then the litter from one large container to another , after the sifter is reinserted . clear enough if you look at the picture , yet i didn't really think it through . it is hard to do without spillage , and so can be pretty messy and it seems like a major operation . i'm currently using sifting liners inserted into this contraption and ignoring its sifting capabilities altogether . i find them much easier . and , they keep the box clean . in this , you can't really use a liner and now there are three large pieces that need to be cleaned . 
=================
great item , bad packaging . i have ordered this product , international delight hazelnut , two times . both times it came with leaking singles that got all over the other ones . i have ordered the irish creme version three times and they have all been received in perfect condition so it must be the shipper . i need more now but will not order this certain one even though it is the cheapest .

cute item ! bought this as a joke to give to a friend that is a beer connisseur ( sp ) for his dog . the dog didn't really care one way or the other and tried to give some to my dog and he also turned up his nose . not sure , but it appears to have a very salty , brothy smell that could be the reason for the turned up doggy noses . however , it was cute to put into staged pictures of the dogs with the plastic bottles looking like they were hung over , along with their master !

the good and the bad the good - necco wafers can get stale if they're in inventory for too long . these weren't . they were fresh and tasted great , if you love necco wafers , and i do . the bad - even though obvious effort had been made to pack them properly , the box was badly battered and the contents had shifted so that the wafers were not at all protected by the little air bags that probably had surrounded them when they were given over to the shippers . thirty six rolls of wafers with , i'm guessing , at least 50 wafers per roll . that would be a minimum of 1800 wafers . all but , perhaps 50 wafers total were broken . . . some just into two or three pieces , but many were smashed to granules . i actually had to put them into a bowl and eat them with a spoon . i really was disappointed .

candy cornmeal this is not candy corn , candycorn meal at best . it was difficult to find even one kernel with all three colors intact . i live in texas and i have seen candy corn in better condition after being thrown around in a highschool student's trunk all summer . amazon packed the bags perfectly well . the barcode on one of the bags shows this , as no amount of poor packaging could make the barcode sticker as worn as it was . seller should describe these as grocery seconds or damaged .

we don't like the new formula i first tried this canned food at the recommendation of a local pet care / store . they gave it very high recommendations and so i have tried both the dry and wet . my three cats liked the wet . so i did the economical thing and putchased a whole case of 24 on amazon . but i noticed the difference as soon as i opened the can . the new wet food is not the same ! ! it's like they have cut the actual food in half and then doubled up on the gravyi went back to the local store and they had a few of the older recipes and i i bought all they had . cans that are marked with a thin green band with the words " new formula with increased flavor " are inferior . 
=================
has aspertame i saw this in the store and was excited . it's very hard to find locally . when i picked up the jar to see the ingredients , i saw they used aspertame instead of sugar . i don't use anything that has that poison . so , i put it back on the shelf and learned how to make my own . it's so simple and cheaper too

overpowering cinnamon at first sip , this tea was pleasantly sweet and abruptly becomes overwhelming with the sharp , dry taste of cinnamon . holding the tea in your mouth for a few seconds and allowing the aromas to circulate through the mouth reduced the nasty aftertaste . watering it down a bit and adding a few drops of honey reduced the potency , as well . the sharpness of the cinnamon is too much for this tea to really be enjoyed and the remaining sachets will likely be used to spice a few gallons of apple cider . 
=================
stevia i started using stevia from a local store but it was extremely expensive . this product was less expensive but same quality . i'll purchase it again . 
=================
clogged brewer the chai latte tastes pretty good , it does leave a filmy residue on the tongue though . i suggest brewing the largest size your brewer will make . be sure to run a mock brew ( water only ) after brewing the latte though . just one latte clogged my brewer and i had to call keurig for service . same goes for hot chocolate too .

his brown teeth are now almost white ! i started using these out of desperation as nothing was helping my dogs bad breath and brown teeth . i don't have the money to take him to the doggy dentist . i'm on my second bag and his teeth are almost white and his breath smells so much better ! 
=================
i wish i liked these ! i bought these because of the high nutrional value and i was really hoping to like these , but . . . . i don't ! since these have gotten such good review here , i'm hoping someone at work will like these . i think you'll either love these or hate them ! 
=================
wish it was cheesier . . . . i am going to drop it into soup . not very tasty on it's own . it's a texture and flavour thing . 
=================
definitely not all flavored coffees ! six were green mtn breakfast blend decaf ( ugh , obviously not what i consider 'flavored' ) , 3 green mtn colombian fair trade select ( not flavored ) , 3 donut house cafe blend ( flavored ? not specified ) , 3 green mtn hazelnut ( yay ) , 3 green mtn pumpkin spice , 3 green mtn gingerbread and 3 newman's own extra bold melange . i don't regret trying these , but it's very unlikely i would buy again because of the unflavored coffees they included and the fact that 6 of those unflavored were decaf . arrived safely , loose in packing box . 
=================
sweet and messy i was expecting something a bit more on the salty side , but these bars are definitely sweet . the peanut butter layer was on the bottom and after spending the morning in my postlady's truck was very melted and very messy . i would not recommend storing these in a warm place or in a lunchbox unless they were near an ice pack as the melted peanut butter coated the inside of the wrapper and made my fingers very sticky . as a nutritional snack they don't make the cut with 220 calories and 13 grams of fat per bar . they were yummy and filling , but i'd prefer a bit more salt flavor to offset the sweetness . i might pick them up on sale , but i can't see this being added to my pantry as a 'must have' item . 
=================
shirataki rice i do use a lot of shirataki noodles while dieting however the shirataki rice is my least favorite form of the konkac root product . . 
=================
msg i really love sazon , i grew up on this stuff . i would love to use it again if they would get with the times and cut out the msg . everyone knows msg is horrible for you , i'm sure goya got the memo as well . 
=================
buy this syrup if you want erythritol as a sweetener erythritol is the only intestine - friendly sugar alcohol and has the most sweetness per caloric content of any sugar alcohol . sucralose , on the other hand , is also in this product and is made by manipulating sugar molecules with chlorine . . yuck . regardless , i prefer this ingredient list to other chocolate syrups . ingredients : water , erythritol , glycerin , cocoa , natural flavors , citric acid , xanthan gum , salt , potassium sorbate , sodium benzoate , caramel color , acesulfame potassium , sucralose , vanillin , artificial flavor , zinc sulfate vitamin e acetate , niacinamide and biotin . there is a bitter aftertaste , but it's sugar free for a reason and i'm sure anyone interested in this product will get used to it . 
=================
love instant breakfast , hate the strawberry wow . apparently i have different taste buds than the other reviewers - and that's okay . i just personally find the strawberry flavor to be disgusting . i haven't bought instant breakfast in a long time , but i don't remember it tasting like that before . anyway , i don't recommend the strawberry variety , but it is a good product in other flavors . also , i have purchased other groceries through amazon and been very happy , so i would recommend this method of purchasing it if you do like it . 
=================
not for my household after doing a great deal of research on feline nutrition and the benefits of a grain - free diet , i decided to switch my three cats from their organic low - grain food to wellness core . i'm not sure if it's the size or the smell or the taste or what , but despite doing the slooow transition method between foods none of my cats seem to like core very much . they also have a kind of hard time eating it because the pellets are so small and round that they just roll away from their mouths ( this could be a good thing for cats that are prone to eating too fast , but that's not the case with my cats ) . the bigger issue though was that within two weeks of being switched to this food , my male cat developed urinary crystals and a partial blockage and had to be hospitalized . i don't know how much the food contributed to that , but the vet did mention that she has seen several cats develop crystals while on wellness . in any case , all of my cats are being switched off of this food . 
=================
coffee rate the beans were very dry or over roasted . the flavor was ok but not a great cup in the morning . the 5lb . bag will last me about 6 weeks as i do drink coffee thru - out the day 7 days a week . probably won't try this type again . over - all i would give it a 4 on a 10 scale . 
=================
price hike i thought the convienience and savings would make it worth it to order this as a subscribe and save , but when i went back to reorder , the price had tripled . . . amazon should notify of these changes . they should also only offer items for subcribe and save that they can continue to offer at the same price and those that will also be available long term . . . . 
=================
not bitter at all i have tasted several brands of barley tea . all of the following were cold brewed , including the one i bought here . one of them was a gift from japan and wasn't roasted , so it wasn't bitter at all . one of them was roasted and very bitter . another one was a mixture of lightly and deeply roasted and tasted okay ( not very bitter ) . this one i am reviewing however , is excellent in taste . it isn't bitter at all , even after cold brewing for several days . the package says it is gently roasted in small quantities . that , plus the fact that it is organic , i believe is the reason it doesn't have the bitter taste . if you don't like bitter drinks and want to drink barely tea , this is a great choice . 
=================
the cat's choice my " rescue " cats remain fiercely loyal to the brand and style of canned food they grew up on and won't even sniff anything else . they're flexible about kibble , but these cans are their daily treat and a disappointed cat is too depressing . at least it arrives quickly at a fairly good price from amazon . 
=================
chex mix muddy buddies pack of 7 muddy buddies was a real life saver . not kidding . my father was in an assisted living home and when he would not eat i would bring out the muddy buddies and he would say i will only eat one . that was ok because then he would eat another and another . they have both the sweet and and salty which helped a lot . he would eat at least a handful and then we were able to get a meal down him . thanks muddy buddies you really were a life saver . i think i cleaned out all of the stores in the area .

my cat's addicted ! my cat loves the tuna recipe so much , it is the only food she'll gobble down in a single sitting . interestingly , she doesn't to be as keen on the other flavors . she seems to especially enjoy the gravy , almost slurping it down ! i give her one pouch a day and free - feed her dry , grain - free kibble . she's healthy and lean , and her coat is silky and luxurious . maybe it's because i once owned a 96 - pound labrador that ate me out of house and home , but i cannot understand why people would think spending $ 1 and change per day to feed a pet is expensive . . . for the price of a soda , you can feed your beloved pet a grain - free , quality cat food . in reality , the junky , mass - marketed supermarket brands are a real waste of money , because you are paying for filler ingredients and added junk . $ 1 . 20 a day is a bargain for the convenience , the quality , what it does for my cat , and how much she enjoys it . i certainly fitter away more than that each day on myself , in the way of " indulgences " ! i know that the economy is bad and there are certainly a lot of people who have fallen on hard times , but for those who can afford to keep a pet in the first place , the cost of higher quality food shouldn't be a deterrent . 
=================
why so expensive ? this brand of tapioca pearls is really good . however , i'm wondering why it's over $ 6 . there is an asian market down the way from me that sells this exact brand , exact same size for under $ 3 . i read the description and it doesn't appear to be that you would get more than 1 bag . i would hope that at this price , you'd at least get 2 bags . anyway , i like this brand better than any that i've tried . 
=================
blueberry cool brew tea the blueberry cool brew black tea that celestial seasonings discontinued was much better . this one was bland to my taste . i wish they still had the blueberry cool brew in black tea instead of green tea because it was the best iced tea i had ever tasted ! 
=================
crystal light on the go we stopped drinking sodas and use crystal light on the go instead . it is very good and the packets are easy to carry and easy to use . just put them in 16 ozs of water . a healthier alternative . 
=================
okay but some weird flavors edit : i just noticed each bag is only 1 . 76 pounds , not 2 . 2 . my review is not 2 stars instead of three . first off , as you can probably guess by the pictures , these are sour gummies . that isn't said in the description . also , each one is about 2 to 2 1 / 2 inches in length and 1 / 2 inch wide . texture and flavor : the came to me soft and with the same texture as most gummies such as peach rings . the sourness is average , not overwhelming but not too little . where i took off the 2 stars was the flavor ( most important part ) . as i chewed them , a few different flavors hit my tongue , none of which tasted that great . i couldn't make out any of them in - particular ( not good at that anyways ) but the combination was just plain strange . i could see myself getting through one bag but will probably give the other 3 away to nephews / niece . after all , they will eat anything sugar coated right ? 
=================
delayed delivery gristedes forces the customer to pay for expedited shipping , yet it took me a month to get my order . also , they only give you an e - mail address to contact them , so you can't ever talk to an actual person . i would say order from another company . my understanding is that most people have problems getting their orders in a reasonable time . 
=================
wouldn't you like to be a pepper too ! these are for true peppers . like most jelly bellys these taste exactly like what they are supposed to . next time i'll order 2 pounds !

no carb sweetner this one is not too expensive and really has no carbs or filler like the powdered splenda or powdered sweet n low , seller shipped asap , customer service was great .

alice tea bags the packaging of these tea bags is really nice . i haven't used the tea yet , but i don't have great hopes for it . it was pricey too . 
=================
garlic seasoning it doesn't have that much garlic flavor . more like salt and pepper . i would recommend garlic lovers garlic by oregon flavor rack . you can order it at spiceman . com . it has visible garlic and garlic oil so it imparts more garlic flavor .

allergic to soy the almonds are very good . only one problem they do not let anyone know the product contains soy on the product page . im allergic to soy . i didnt know why i was getting sleepy after eating the almonds . then i looked on the can . i love them but cant eat them .

poor consistancy i bought this from the omaha website and was unable to write a review there so i am writing it here . i have purchased from omaha and amazon many times and this was me second chateaubriand . the first was outstanding just like everything from omaha in the past but this second chateaubriand was not up to par . first the taste was not the same and it was not nearly as tender as the first . i will buy again but i hope for better results . thanks for reading . 
=================
tasted fermented i am not at all fond of the switch black cherry . it tasted fermented , almost alcoholic , to me . i asked my husband to try it for his opinion and he said it reminded him of smirnoff black ice ( which , i can't say i have tried , so i can't personally confirm his flavor comparison ) . the can touts " 100 % of what you want , 0 % of what you don't want " explaining what it contains ( 100 % juice , 100 % rda vitamin c , all natural , carbonation , great taste and refreshment ) and what it doesn't contain ( no sugar added , no corn syrup , no preservatives , no artificial colors , gluten free ) . it has 130 calories , 0g fat , 15mg sodium , 35g carbs ( 33g sugar ) , 0g protein , and 100 % vitamin c . the ingredients list reads , " 100 % juice ( filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates , apple , grape , acerola , and cherry juice concentrates ) , natural flavors , ascorbic acid ( vitamin c ) . i appreciate the attempt to make a " natural " carbonated juice beverage , but this drink is not for me . i hope you enjoy it more .

=================
taste a small quantity , first , from a local store . it doesn't taste like tea to me . this drink mix doesn't taste like tea . you might like it as a beverage , but the bitter pom - a - granite flavor is not for everyone . putting more splenda in it helps a little . if you can find a small quantity of this mix locally , then taste it first before buying the large quantity from amazon . for a sugar - free mix that really tastes like a delicious , refreshing tea , try arizona sugar free green tea mix , instead . 
=================
great chew toy ! i usually have only great things to say about most nylabone chews , however , the shape / style of this one i do not like . it also seems to splinter more quickly than the other products . one bone will typically last my pooch 2 - 4 weeks , this one i had to throw out after just one week . i will not purchase this product again . 
=================
watch out for the rocks ! we normally use the bioitalia canned lentils , but they have been out of stock here on amazon for quite a while now . since these seemed to be a very similar alternative to our usual lentils , we went ahead and ordered a case . however , we have not been pleased with the results through the first three cans . we have found tiny rocks in two of the cans and the third was spoiled , tasting sour and making a loud pop when opened . this company definitely needs to work on their quality control . the lentils themselves taste fine ( when not spoiled ) , but you better watch out for the rocks if you want to avoid a trip to the dentist . . . as for us , we will stick with the bioitalia lentils from now on , even if we have to track them down an hour away from our house at whole foods , as we have been through a few cases of those now and found no rocks as of yet . . . edit 9 / 27 / 11 : i added a photo of our " rock collection " through 4 cans to the main product page . 
=================
inflation product is good ; my cats like it . but the price just keeps climbing . i will have to train my cats to eat cheaper cat food . 
=================
meh . . . not a fave , prefer the other blonde when starbucks came out with the " blonde " roasts , i got pretty excited because i prefer lighter roasts ( as do 40 % of coffee drinkers , according to the barista at the store ) . . . light roasts are a little earthier , not as burnt tasting . so i scored a bag each of the willow and veranda . this one , the veranda , didn't do a lot for us . subjectively speaking , it was so smooth it was boring . . . it had no snap , and was kind of mixed and mushy , not a definitive flavor . it's supposed to have " delicate nuances of soft cocoa and lightly toasted nuts " - really ? we missed that . on the other hand , we really liked the willow , which had a brighter citrus - y note and was more flavorful . the taste was ( for lack of better words ) clear , defined . you buy a light roast to taste the bean , not the roast . the willow was flavorful , not acidy , and had a clean finish . your tastes may vary , but if you like a snappy light roast , or a " breakfast roast " the veranda probably won't be your pick , but do try the willow . 
=================
very fair price good price for 2 lbs loose teathe taste is very goodi have had better but not complaining

they dropped the ball on quality i used to love this coffee , last few shipments it has be sour . i moved on to others ( saxby's guatemala & costa rica are similar to what jeremiah's used to be like ) 
=================
good tea and good value , not packaged well . i bought this tea box sets for giving the boxes away as little gifts . i already knew that pg tips makes great tea from past experience . unfortunately , when the package arrived , i found some of the boxes to be squashed , and the rest had a lot of loose tea on the outside trapped in the wrap , which gave them a dirty look and made them unsuitable for gifting . also , the tea wasn't very fresh . 
=================
good but gone i recently experienced this fine product courtesy of the shelves of dollar tree . unfortunately this product has been discontinued by conagra . i would imagine that it was way overpriced and this led to its failure . great taste , ample ingredients , you name it . if only they had priced it right from day one . 
=================
there's another way i tried this since i love bacon everything . i found it to have this odd after taste that gets worse every time you eat more of it . if you want bacon mayo try taking your favorite mayo and add j and d's bacon salt to it then let it sit for a few minutes and you'll have a good tasting mayo with bacon flavor . 
=================
not what they promised this was my first kickstarter contribution , and now i'm skeptical of ever doing another ! these coffee joulies simply don't work , and they take up all the room in a cup .

no response to a vital question ! i asked " swanson health products " for an answer to my question : would you be so good as to tell me if the process being use to purify the fructose is the castner - kellner process ( commonly used ) ? their reply : after speaking with several product specialists and a supervisor , we were unable to locate additional information on how the swanson 100 % premium fructose item # sw1083 is processed . now i ask you ; how could they know if it is 100 % pure ? 
=================
dissapointed i love to eat campbell's chunky soup . i ordered this pack of 12 cans on a whim one day . i signed up to get these every 6 months for the reduced price . i should have been more careful and read the details . these cans of soup are a lot smaller than i am used to seeing in the store . camp bell's chunky soup is usually in cans that are larger than an ordinary soup . these cans however are the typical size of a can of soup . on top of the size of the can , i realized that i can get regular size of campbell's chunky soup for cheaper than these cans if i find them on sale . i highly recommend passing on this purchase and spending your money somewhere else . what did i learn with this purchase ? always read reviews before buying anything on amazon : ) 
=================
chewy beef jerky i love beef jerky , especially the chewy type . i read the reviews that this particular kind tastes like leather and is rubbery . i tried it anyway , since the price is much lower than the other beef jerky types . my first impression of the medallions is that it is very thin . it is somewhat rubbery . it is also very hot . i didn't like it at first , but the taste grew on me . i actually loved it now . i would take a scissor and cut the medallions into strips and then slowly taste and savor each one . the longer i chew , the more flavor i taste . there is a good portion in the container too . 
=================
liked the product the last time but this vendor never sent the pop rocks having ordered pop rocks for a group of students over a year ago , it seemed like a good idea to order the 36 pack for a new group this fall . the order was placed in early august . it is currently september and although i have written amazon for resolution and they responded nicely , the order of pop rocks has yet to arrive . the rocks were needed for a fun way to introduce science lab books to a group of fifth graders . do be careful from whom you order .

amazon listing misleading 20 % off at checkout i purchased a 24 pack of this wonderful product . extra 20 % off galil productssave 5 % when you enter code glilsv20 at checkout . plus , save an additional 15 % when you combine the instant rebate with your subscribe & save order - - bringing your total savings to 20 % . offer valid through december 25 , 2011 . learn more . trying to use this 20 % promo code was totally useless , and once you place an order via amazon buying , just try to find anything helpful , or " contact us " . choices are very limited , " cancel , change address , change payment write a review " once placed they don't want to hear from you to resolve an issue . check it out ! ! 
=================
delicious but . . . a little hiccup i found the granola itself to be very delicious and it is exactly what i wanted . the chocolate element makes it just indulgent enough so i'll be motivated to eat breakfast and not skip it . considering i ordered this " bulk " item , i thought the expiration date would be like 2010 or 2011 . however , it expires in september ! it gives me like two or three months to finish the boxes . i thought that was kind of ridiculous . 
=================
not cheap it is okay but i wouldn't buy again , i'd rather make my own from scratch using fresh frozen fruit . 
=================
cheap price , cheap taste this is the second try i've given this particular brand and i still do not like it . maranatha brand almond butter has replaced the store shelf space where other brands that i liked used to be and it is much cheaper at the store - the cheapest - of all almond butters i've seen so far . it's like buying peanut butter - you get what you pay for . i think the problem i have with it is that it doesn't taste like it's made from fresh almonds . it tastes stale or on the verge of being rancid . it could be the oil used or the almonds i have no idea . i just bought it and tasted it without letting it sit around for awhile . i like to spread it on apple slices for a healthy snack . i wanted to like it but after having other brands i loved , i will not ever purchase this brand again . if you are picky about peanut butter then you might be picky about almond butter too . i keep hoping the stores will bring back the other brands to the shelf but right now they aren't giving any choice at the regular ( non - specialty ) supermarkets . my favorite was organic raw almond butter but now that is becoming impossible to find in the supermarkets thanks to maranatha . 
=================
creamy and mild - if you like that about what you might expect from taco bell sauce . it's middle - of - the - road in terms of spice and texture . not too spicy - which was fine for me . the texture was very creamy which might not appeal to everyone . it was workable but nothing terribly exciting . in other words , it got the job done by adding some flavor without getting in the way . it you like your sauces with a bit more bite and more texture , you might want to look elsewhere . otherwise , this won't disappoint . 
=================
not bad , but i won't reorder thanks for the egg tip , it works very well and really helps this product . nevertheless , i ended up giving away three of the six containers because i was not thrilled with the nutritional information . 
=================
great brand , yucky flavors i hate to badmouth such a great brand , because we really like earth's best and love getting them with amazon subscribe n save . but honestly , these are gross . i try not to feed sam anything i wouldn't eat , and both of us agreed . . . we won't ever get this selection again . 
=================
just instant coffee just buy a can of instant coffee and stir it into hot water . this is cheaper than the original packages but it does't have coffee . this is not brewed coffee . literally leaves an empty cup after brewing . 
=================
i wonder what others were talking about ? i didn't like this coffee at all . i like strong , full - flavored coffee and this is not it . there is mild bitterness and the coffee was slightly weak . so far the only k - cup coffee that i enjoy is the barista prima italian roast ( i think that's the brand ) , but i wanted something i could order on subscribe and save , so i always had coffee . i ordered the tully's italian roast to see how it is , but it too isn't as good as the other . 
=================
does this dogfood make your dog pass gas a lot ? i have a chocolate lab who is allergic to chicken so , we are trying this dogfood instead of his usual fish / potato blue basics . he seems to be fine with the dog food since he is not itching and has not had any ear infections . but , he has horrible odd smelling breath and he is very gassy . i am wondering if there is just something in the ingredients that he doesn't tolerate . has anyone else experienced this with their dogs on this dogfood ? 
=================
alright nice company , will answer your emails . this fish is ok . kind of pricey , not that decadent . i'm not sure i would purchase this again . similar to canned tuna in texture and presentation . 
=================
it's a gas our little dog really likes this food , she gobbles it up . however . . . i can't think of a delicate way to say this , so i'm just going to say it . it gave her really bad breath and toxic flatulence . 
=================
good if you like frisbees call me a fool , but when i ordered jack link's smokehouse beef jerky medallions , i thought i was getting beef jerky , not frisbees . these seemed more like doggy snacks than real beef jerky . having eaten many jack link's products before , i expected more of the same good quality snacks but this was not one of them . these are made from chopped bits of beef which are then formed into discs . consequently , the resulting product is tough and plastic - like , for want of a better word . i imagine dogs would enjoy them a great deal . two stars for the pleasing peppery flavor and the value . zero stars for the consistency . 
=================
loaded with additives & preservatives since amazon doesn't list the ingredients , here they are : coconut milk , water , sodium metabisulfite , polysorbate 60 , sodium carboxymethylcellulose , and guar gum . that alone speaks volumes to me . 
=================
absolutely vile i love mincemeat . my grandmother made mincemeat . i make it now myself . this is not mincemeat . this is disgusting . here are the ingredients in crosse & blackwell's " mincement , " in order of volume , according to the label : apples , high fructose corn syrup , corn syrup , raisins , water , vinegar , corn starch , and then trace elements of orange peel , salt , spices , caramel color , orange juice , and preservatives . ( as an aside , what on earth is the purpose of that orange juice , which exists in less quantity than the caramel color . ) in other words , this concoction is apples , drenched in high - fructose corn syrup and regular corn syrup , with a few raisins . lord knows what the " spices " were , because they could scarcely be distinguished under the sickly aftertaste of corn syrup . here are the ingredients from a recipe for real mincemeat , again in order of volume : apples , raisins , beef ( for those who like it ) , sultanas , currents , sour cherries , citrons , sugar , strawberry preserves , apricot preserves , orange peel , lemon peel , spices ( cinnamon , cloves , nutmeg , mace , allspice ) , salt . this mixture is marinated in liquor - rum , brandy , sherry , apple jack , or whatever additional or alternative liquor you may enjoy . our family's recipe calls for these things ; other people use different fruits , most omit the meat , some use juice and vinegar instead of liquor . but the result , in any case , is rich , spicy , complex and delicious . or , if you prefer , you may have crosse & blackwell's canned apples with high - fructose corn syrup . 
=================
too sweet this is way too sweet , i was expecting a kick of sour with the lime , maybe i should have gone with lemon . there is too much sugar in this mix . but this gives a good , strong lime flavor for those who are looking for a lot of lime . 
=================
friskies indoor cat treats my cats love these treats and they are getting hard to find in the store . however the price is way too high . i paid over $ 4 for each of these and i can buy them at walmart for $ 2 . 93 when they are in stock . i am very disappointed because i thought i was buying a 10 pak and not a single bottle at that price . i won't buy them again through petco . my cats will have to adjust to something else that is sold at a more reasonable price . 
=================
complete steal makes no sense how the 200g package costs ~ $ 7 , and the 14 . 12oz costs ~ $ 7 ; for those of you that are not familiar with the different unit systems 14 . 12oz = 400g , so you can get double the size for the same price . 
=================
baronet coffee i tried to replace my mellita pods with the baronet coffee pods . it tastes better but the outer covering is too dense . when the highpressure water tries to filter thru the coffee basket , it sometimes spews out the front of the coffe pot . the water could burn someone . 
=================
great on popcorn ! try this on popcorn . it is very good ! i bought mine direct from bell plantation . the price here is not right . i give it a four for flavor but take away 2 for costing twice what it should
=================
mild heat combined with too much vinegar . this is a mild hot sauce . that means you can apply it liberally and it's unlikely you will make any dish too hot . so it is user friendly . ingredients ( as copied from the label ) : aged cayenne peppers , distilled vinegar , water , salt - etcwhy 2 stars ? this sauce lacks any character beyond a heavy dose of vinegar . if you happen to like a lot of vinegar in your hot sauce - then you'll love this sauce and my 2 star rating is way off base . i don't like anywhere near this much vinegar . i've blind taste tested over 30 hot sauces and there are many better ones . what is interesting is that the original tabasco sauce has a near identical taste to franks once it is diluted . you will find mention that this sauce was top rated by cooks illustrated . that is absolutely true but what these pundits fail to mention is this was a casual test , done in 2005 , comparing only three hot sauces ! suggestion : since tastes vary and if you happen to like this sauce - then buy it in one of its larger sizes - at least 23 oz and consider the gallon size . they cost little more than the smaller sizes . i'd encourage others to experiment with a sauce that is not so heavily laden with vinegar - you just might prefer it . try any of these : a ) huy fong sriracha hot chili sauce - this sauce has considerable heat but it is nicely balanced against a bit of sweetness combined with a hint of garlic . virtually every supermarket carries it - look in the asian section ! no vinegar . b ) cholula original hot sauce - features a fine blend of peppers - medium hot and readily available - look in the mexican section . it has a hint of vinegar . c ) valentina salsa picante mexican extra hot sauce - a great blend with more vinegar than the above but not too much . another great blend . d ) valentina salsa picante mexican hot sauce - a decent blend but with a lot of vinegar . still it is much better than franks . e ) tapatio hot salsa picanta - another widely distributed and excellent mexican hot sauce . a lot of vinegar but far less than franks . once again you will find this in your mexican isle . in my opinion , all of the above are far superior to franks . if you like franks and are at the least bit curious , you should try any of these other hot sauces

horrible mixture of flavors , bad texture i normally like jellied fruit slices like these snak club fruit slices , 7 - ounce bags , ( pack of 6 ) , but the mixture of lemon , lime , orange , cherry and grape is wildly different between bags . in one bag i just got 1 lemon slice , but 8 ( ! ) cherry slices . in another bag , there were 10 ( ! ! ! ) grape and one of each of the other fruits . the wildly varying flavor assortment is terrible for me , who like all the flavors , but have a couple of favorites ( lemon , orange ) . with some of the bags , after eating my favorites out ( 1 lemon , 1 orange ) , i just threw the rest out . very disappointing ! additionally , these jellied fruits are harder than the ones you're used too , reminding you of chewing waxed lips or candles . not a very pleasant experience . if you are like me , and love orange the best , i would recommend brach's orange slices , 10 . 5 - ounce packages ( pack of 12 ) . they are by far the best orange slices i've eaten - made with real fruit juice and have a soft , easily chewable texture .

raisen juice i bought this about a year ago and remember being so disappointed in the flavor , that i never bought it again . it seems that a lot of these cheap teas , taste like dirt . not that i remember ever eating dirt , but that is what comes to mind when i taste it . i think this company uses a lot of raisen / prune juice to cover it up . that is the flavor that overpowers many of these teas , as well as cinnamon and anise , in some . people who like fruit cake might like it . i'm not one of them . i don't remember specifics about this flavor except that the picture is false advertising . the luscious orange flavor was only hinted at . the taste did not inspire me to try any of the other flavors , but prior to that , i did find one called tuscany , that by itself had too much cinnamon . but on a hunch , i added it to carnation instant cocoa ( with the marshmellows ) and it was fantastic ! one good thing i can say is that i appreciate the wax paper packaging . shiny metallic paper used in bigelow and twinings , i think , adds a metallic taste .

more qestions than answers great bergamot aroma , but unacceptable bitterness . , my question is this real bergamot oil used in the process or just an artificial substitute ? usually when the natural oil is used it states so . this tea only list bergamot " flavor " as the ingredient . this is usually a clever " legal " way of cheating on customers . second , like some others have written , i also noticed a harsh bitter aftertaste when brewed past 5 minutes . thats not very long and one shouldn't have to put a stop watch to a cup of tea ! maybe an artificial bergamot makes it bitter ? i've been searching for a replacement for an old favorite . best earl grey ever was williamson & magor , but sadly the company is no longer solvent after a 100 plus years . they used genuine bergamot " oil " and it was phenominal ! dimah's tin caddy is fantastic and should be an industry standard ! update : taylors of harrogate earl grey leaf tea , loose leaf , is awesome ! ! ! beats this bitter dilmah impostor like a rented mule . taylors of harrogate is even better than my old favorite and uses " real " oil of bergamot .

smashed , but . . . . . . . . . if they has been whole , and not wet from a ripped packaged , they seemed as if they would have tasted yummy , from the look and smell of them . i received a polite response and a fast refund . if they package these better for shipping , i would try to buy these again .

puts the guilt in " guilty pleasure " without the pleasure i am a sucker for mac & cheese . it's a guilty pleasure . i sneak a bite at every buffet and thanksgiving dinner , even though i know it's for " the kids " and it's bad for my health . when i saw this , the marketing seemed to be aimed at grown - ups , and i thought , " maybe my wife will let me get away with this . " it tasted like chicken covered in ballpark nacho cheese sauce . orzo is a terrible choice for mac & cheese . if you follow the instructions , the orzo becomes overcooked and its texture is so similar to the sauce itself it effectively dissolves . the cheese / starch ratio is too high . it should have been elbow or penne . green dust came out of the broccoli packet . once rehydrated , it looked more like broccoli , but there wasn't enough . i could not taste the broccoli at all . there are few things i won't eat , but i will never eat this again . bottom line : i have a recipe that's nearly as quick and much healthier . i designed it for convenience and speed . for better flavor , saute the chicken separately and add it last . 1 . boil 1 gallon of water . 2 . add 1 box of pasta , 2 chopped raw chicken breasts , some chopped broccoli . 3 . cook until pasta and chicken are done . 4 . drain water from pot . 5 . slowly add 1 package of finely shredded cheese while stirring to melt . 6 . serve immediately .

was not disappointed ! i'm really picky about chocolate especially when it comes to truffles . quality is a must ! so needless to say i was nervous buying these as a christmas present when i hadn't actually tried them myself . later however , i got a chance to try them and i was not disappointed ! smooth and creamy ! they melt in your mouth !

much too sweet ! the flakes are the right texture and are crisp . the raisins are chewy and delicious . the fiber is great . however , the sweetness of the brown sugar is extremely overpowering and much too sweet . due to this fact , i probably will not purchase this cereal again . too bad general mills ruined an otherwise good fiber cereal .

betty crocker cake mix very disappointed . we love this cake and can only find the mixes when we visit family in iowa . we were so excited to see we could order on - line . however , we ordered on 6 / 2 / 08 and when cake mixes arrived a few days later they had a " best when used by date " of 06 / 06 / 08 ! ! ! ! imagine having to use 12 mixes in one day ! i hope they keep for a little while . the first one we baked came out fine , so we'll see how the others do .

love at first bite for my girl well , after several different tries at different foods , i finally did some research this morning and decided to try wellness core . i bought the ocean one since my dog ( a 10 year old smooth coat collie ) loves fish . i really think that is why she has always loved to get into the cat's kibble . . . she likes fish ! she has allergies to corn and wheat i think . her skin was always a problem for years . i finally started giving her fish oil and later olive oil on her food . she has never liked any dry kibble i've given her , and i admit i've given her some poor quality foods not knowing it ( beneful , pedigree , nutrish . . . etc . ) well , i went and bought the wellness core this morning , walked in at lunch and she followed me , sniffing the bag ( can she really smell it through that bag ? ) i dumped out the rachael ray nutrish that had been sitting in her bowl since yesterday , and put 1 cup of this wellness core ocean in her bowl . she went right up to it , took one piece out , put it on the floor and ate it . . . took another piece out , put it on the floor and ate it . . and then proceeded to put her head in the bowl and eat it all up ! she then drank some water , went and lay down , and did not bother me while i was eating a turkey sandwich ! wow . i am so hopeful that this food is the answer for her . 
=================
not bad ; not fantastic . . . the flavor wasn't too bad . . . a lot of outside reviews said that the flavor of bael fruit took some getting used to , but these packets were pre - sweetened and the flavor wasn't overpowering . it was a bit difficult to dissolve in cold water , so i would put a little hot water at the bottom to dissolve the powder and then add cold water and ice if you would like it cold instead of hot .

it's a boy bubble gum hi , my first grandson was born and i wanted everything under the sun to celebrate ! this is a wonderful idea that has been around for a very long time ! however . . . . . . everything was fine and wonderful except the fact that they just weren't fresh . these little bubble gum cigars were as hard as a rock ! the moral of the story is that being a " fun " item the shipping was as much as the cigars themselves . . . . at least they could have been fresh and not hard .

tastes like perfumed soap i am a daily herbal tea drinker . i prefer green teas , but also love red bush teas . i used to drink fruit teas and even longer ago , i drank black teas before going caffine - free . i never thought i would not like a tea . well , this is the first one that makes me cringe and i wish to never drink it again . unfortunately , i bought 6 boxes here at amazon with many individually wrapped bags , and i don't want to throw my money away , so i will drink all 6 boxes ( i did leave one at a family member's house , just to be rid of a whole box ) . i bought one box of the yogi blueberry slim tea at the store ( one box only to test it first ) and it's quite good . as the title of my review states , this tea tastes like perfumed soap , so i can't recommend this super anti - oxidant flavor . i do love the little tags attached to the bags carrying wise sayings : )

no other martini olive will do once you've had a martini with an ybarra piquillo stuffed olive , no other will do . these olives have a rich , profound flavor - not just the bland , salty flavor ofsupermarket green olives . and the piquillo pimentos really taste of red pepper ( though they're not hot . ) if you choose your gin with care , you should do no less for your olive . justbeware the temptation to snack on these olives by themselves - else you mightfind your martini oliveless !

captain midnight , you lied to me ! i can still remember captain midnight sitting there in the uniform of an astronaut of the 50's ( khaki shirt and black four - in - hand tie ) telling me solemnly that i should drink my ovaltine because it tasted good and it was good for me . it was , after all , brown and that meant it had to be chocolate , my favorite flavor . what the uranus traveler never told me was that they were crystals that would sit at the top of the warm milk and never dissolve . furious stirring with a metal tool called a spoon didn't do it , nor did trying to grind them up against the side of the cup . even using a tenderizer tool didn't work as i soon discovered that as you pushed it down the cup , the warm milk came up and out . you had to compromise by trying to round up the little critters on the spoon and that offered little comfort as the crunchy buggers didn't taste all that great anyway . to top it off , all you had left was warm milk . the jar of ovaltine was also very resilient . it lasted a long time in our home . it was the same one . even my father who liked the " old standbys " of shredded wheat and corn flakes we never ate , didn't go near this stuff . i only recommend this for those who have lost their taste buds through constant sword swallowing or that fire breathing trick . captain midnight , you lied to me !

how sad i love these biscuits a great deal . but they sell for $ 3 . 19 and cost $ 6 . 99 to ship to you ? ? ? no way as they break very easy and thats twice the cost of the initial product . almost makes going to look in cost plus where they sell them for $ 3 . 99 a bargain .

three dog bakery bitty bites , baked dog treats , assorted flavors , 13 ounces i would say that these treats are average . i like how they use the term " ultra premium quality . " whatever that means ! these treats are very oily and have the consistency of shortbread cookies . very soft and crumbly . yes the dogs love them , but i think i'll get something else next time .

an acquired taste i did not care for the taste or texture . i was able to get rid of these by sharing them at parties .

tasty , but pricey . but beware the shipping ! i tried these chips looking for a healthy snack and they are quite tasty . the packing / shipping however leaves a lot to be desired . my box came completely smashed up and all the bags are crushed , with only about 1 / 4 of the chips in each bag actually intact . the rest are crumbs and dust . very disappointed in the packaging . there should be a box within a box and some type of protection . . ie packing peanuts .

from " straw " hair to healthy hair " healthy " also deserves quotes , i suppose . same as fingernails or animal horns , as all hair is dead on a cellular level - - unromantic but true . i have " thirsty " ( those quotes , again ! ) hair , and conditioner doesn't always seem to help much . i also have skin sensitivities , so after one manufacturer changed a formula on one of my faves for the worse , i decided to try coconut oil . the results are dramatic . my hair looks really nice , as shiny as it was in my 20s , it's soft again , and i'm feeling kind of like a dupe that i've been buying chemically formulated conditioner all these years . i agree with other reviewers that this oil , or at least the batch i got , seems to have something in it to keep it from solidifying ( at least in a 70something degree bathroom ) the way most culinary coconut oils will . it also doesn't have the same rich coconut flavor of my favorite brands , such as nutiva organic extra virgin coconut oil , 29 - ounce jars ( pack of 2 ) - but then it's filtered , and not extra - virgin . probably for the best , because as nice as coconut is , i really don't want to go around smelling like cheap suntan lotion ! disclaimer : using too much will obviously wreck greasy havoc on some hair , especially finer , lighter , european hair - - which i have , actually . i couldn't have used this at all back in the day when my hair was naturally on the oily side , but if you have coarse , frizzy , wiry , or even just really dry hair , you can probably find the right amount for you to bring back the nice texture and shine without getting overly heavy - - even if that means mixing it in with a bit of gentle shampoo .

meow . i have a cat named charlie who loves this food . i have found that he looks healthier and his coat looks nicer when i feed him iams then with other foods . he also seems to love this food and gets excited when i go in to the kitchen . . . that's his time to show off ( i think ) that he can eat . this comes in a 5 pack and amazon shipped it right away , so no complaints there . edit : march 20 , 2011i can not recommend this food anymore . too many recalls and the ingredients are garbage . i am using chicken soup for the cat lovers soul and my furry friend looks better , lost weight and is more active . to iams . . . you have lost a customer due to your outsourcing and horrible product quality control .

new taste i have been using benecol smart chews for the last 2 years and they have been great for lowering my cholesterol . a great alternative to statin drugs . i was completely dismayed when they were taken off the market a few months ago . i just received my first shipment of the " new " benecol chews . the taste is dreadful ! i will take them but i am very disappointed in the new taste . i guess they reformulated this product . also , they are not available any more by the automatic system at amazon - also a disappointment . 
=================
tastes like diet soda i'm not a huge soda drinker because of the carbs and calories . i don't ever drink traditional diet drinks because i do not like the diet soda taste . i use stevia in the raw at home daily and i have enjoyed the lack of calorie sweetness that it gives me , which lead me to try these sodas . to wrap it up , they have a very strong diet drink taste which is what i was trying to avoid to begin with . if you don't like artificial sweeteners as a concept but don't mind the taste , these drinks may be a more natural alternative for you . dont expect any of the flavors to taste like anything but a diet soda .

x - cellent instant tea mix compared with arizona's bottled teas , this product is clearly the winner . it tastes fresh , while the arizona pre - mixed tea tastes stale . . . like it sits in warehouses too long prior to being sold . . . which i imagine it does . other instant tea mixes vary from poor to barely acceptable . this mix is " clearly and refreshingly " at the " tea - top !

you get what you pay for . this is a large amount of matcha for the money . the catch ? it's not the best quality . seriously . if you're used to a higher quality like domatcha , you will be really disappointed in this . it is quite sour and briny compared . however , it is good 'backup' matcha to have on hand in case you run out of the good stuff .

cheeto - flavored ramen i expected much more from this product given the glowing reviews . at the end of the day , the taste reminded me more of cheetos than of anything that i'd consider real cheese . i'll give it the 2nd star because it's pretty easy to make . . . but i'm not sure i'd order this again once my stock of 8 is diminished - - given the taste that might be 4 - 6 months from now anyways .

caveat emptor , dear reader ! i bought the 80 count newmans own because it is the best coffee i have tried in the k cup . period . plus , it is supposed to be organic , and i tust this brand because it is the newman name and hope his daughter is running a tight ship on her parents behalf . however , i was in a hurry when i ordered and did not cross check price or shipping cost ( duh ! as my kids would say ) . i paid twelve dollars more for this item than i would have at costco and then the seller ( potential dynamix llc ) gouged me with a $ [ . . . ] shipping charge . never again . we cannot assume because we are buying something on amazon that we are getting great prices . heck , i knew that . guess i just need to re learn stuff now .

who needs cheese when you have chocolate i purchased these at a " local " target for movie snacks . they are pretty good . any lover of teddy grams will enjoy these . the dry marshmallows are reminiscent of the kind in cereal . they have a tiny grove in them so you can " stack them " . i strongly recommend them . what i don't recommend is putting them in a bowl and dumping milk on them . it is a horrible idea and creates and unpleasant gritty slurry .

made be a believer dinni's select spicy shrimp sauce , 12 - ounce bottles ( pack of 3 ) bingo ! finally last year i got a gift pack containing 1 jar each of dinni's spicy shrimp sauce , honey mustard and italian herb vinaigrette . all these products made a believer out of me . these is no difference that i could tell in shrimp i cooked with dinni's spicy shrimp sauce and the one i eat at bonefish . amongst the 3 product each one was better than the other . i have ordered several times since then from amazon . there are some products amazon does not carry , which i buy from dinni's website , and always the company includes a free jar as repeat customer appreciation . the free stuff is not mentioned on dinni's site hence i was surprised the first time . every product i have tasted is simply amazing . i don't understand why amazon does not carry all of them . we throw several parties every year . i always wanted to serve the bonefish bang bang shrimp , but it is not practical , so i started searching the web to find a exact recipe , the first one i tried was the one which had lots of good reviews , it called for ; mayonnaise , thai sweet & hot chili sauce . after 3 hours shopping and trying to purchase hard to find ingredients and another hour in the kitchen , the result was very disappointing . the shrimp turned out to be miles apart from bonefish's shrimp . don't get me wrong the shrimp was ok if you are not looking for the bonefish taste , but defiantly it was not a knockoff . 
=================
love this line of products ( ! ) but this one needs a little improvement stevia sweetened colas has finally come of age and i love many zevia flavors but this one has a strange and unappetizing taste after swallowing it . now my 5 year old likes it so theres a critic in the house who differs with me some , anyhow . but seriously it needs more work to get the flavor to something not so odd and unlikable .

great if only they were usa my labrador loves all the treats from dogswell ! however , all of the dogswell jerky treats i have come across are made in china . as a dog lover , i cannot knowingly give my dog a product from china . it does say " cage - free " , but really ? i'm not sure . but dogswell jerky bars are made in the usa & my dog loves this just as much ! so bad news on the regular jerky , but upside : dogswell has some usa products too !

hit & miss seems like a good product and we actually did get a few shitake's from it . . . but not nearly as many as you'd expect . yes , we re - read the instructions and yes , we tried it several times ( 5 times ) with the same results . entertaining for my kids the first time , but after several failures they lost interest and my wife continued to buy shitake's at the grocery store . i am pretty certain we won't do it again .

great product - - postage overpriced 3 pack 1 / 2 grain 1000 saccharin tabletsproduct is great and can't be found in my area ( western pa ) . can't believe it should cost as much to ship the product ( package of three plastic bottles ) as the cost of the product itself . shipping and handling is a rip - off . profit margin on shipping must be better than on the product itself .

just a collection of snacks if you eat everything in the package you will have consumed 18 grams of fat . it includes a huge package of hummus and about 5 crackers ; it's really just a collection of small snacks . it may keep you full briefly but don't count on this to feel like an actual meal .

not trackless my husband has a dust allergy , so we tried this out to reduce his sneezing . daily use seemed less dusty than other brands , and it did a decent job at odor control . however , cleaning and refilling the cat's box with this product raised a silica cloud that bothered my lungs . also , our cat tracked it all over the place - - stepping on litter pearls is like stepping on bits of broken safety glass . the cat's box emitted alarmingly loud crunching noises when the cat used it . we've gone back to ordinary clumping . my hubby still sneezes , but on average , lung irritation in the house has gone down . we feel safe walking barefoot again , and the cat is once again a stealthy poo - er . 
=================
very disappointing burnt / bitter flavor my girlfriend and i picked up a box of these from costco , and had high hopes that they'd be delicious , natural crackers . we are very open - minded about natural foods and most of the stuff we eat is very healthy and natural . well these crackers just taste burnt and bitter ; they have the right ingredients , but the flavor just doesn't work . we have previously bought , and still buy , the crunchmaster multigrain crackers crunchmaster multi - grain crackers gluten free 20 oz . , and have found them to be the best natural , gluten - free , multigrain crackers on the market . we're going to stick with the crunchmaster crackers , they have a fantastic flavor , are very healthy , and go with everything great ( cheese , dips , peanut butter , you name it ) . another reviewer here noted that these taste like " burnt birdseed " ; couldn't agree more , they were a huge disappointment . if you do decide to try these crackers , be sure to buy a very small box , then you won't feel as ripped off when you realize they are borderline inedible . 
=================
okay , not bad - just not great . the taste of this reminds me of a cross between diet rite and tab . it's just a little bit too much on the sweet side , and a bit flat . i wouldn't buy it again , but it's okay to drink . it's unoffensive .

for adults or overstimulated kids ? has a strange " chemically " taste that is really not identifiable as any sort of real fruit . the instructions say to squeeze once per 8 oz . but , i can squeeze harder or softer and a different amount will come out so it is hard to know how much you are getting . the product label design seems like it might be for kids with the bright colors , playful fonts , fruity flavors , and product name . what is " natural caffeine " anyway ? does that mean it is safe for anyone ? it needs to be refrigerated after opening . you can't take it around with you and add it to water you might get from a fountain or someplace . the appealing part of these water " enhancers " is that you can usually take them with you to use if you are out and about or camping / backpacking .

if you like ginger , you will like these that being said , i dont really like ginger that much . i found that out after i bought these . i still eat them because i get queasy every morning for some reason . they work ! oh , helpful tip - - - don't try and chew these bad boys . even though they're called chews , i suck them until they dissolve . i tried to chew them and it just doesn't seem possible .

great taste until the price increase i've been buying the yc chocolate brand for many years ( the milk chocolate with almonds version ) . in 2006 the price was $ 25 . 27 for a box of 10 ( web orders , but not directly from the producer , ycchocolate . com ) . in the past several years i could only buy directly from the producer for $ 29 . 90 ( box of 10 ) plus a free bar for each box ordered . i've been running low lately and when i went to the usual web site , i found they were now selling for $ 40 per box of 8 ! ! today i checked again and the price is now $ 42 for a box of 8 , from ycchocolate and from amazon . needless to say , they have lost me as a regular customer . the chocolate is among the best " no sugar added " chocolates ( it's as good as regular chocolate ) , i would recommend them to anyone . but with a price increase of 78 % , no way .

was a great coffee for the price until recently i bought this espresso bean for use with my rocket giotto ii premium plus espresso maker , and my macap m4 grinder . my name is toca , and i'm an espresso fiend . while i like this coffee and agree with a previous reviewer that it's a " standard bearer " in my house , now they've priced it such that i'm more inclined to buy my espresso beans locally . i previously used " subscribe and save " to get the price at less than a twenty spot per bag . i'll return to them when their prices return to where they were in april or i get tired of the local stuff . it's really too bad because i love this coffee . and there may be very good reasons for the price increase , but i'm more inclined to get adventurous with my source of coffee beans than take a 27 % price hike in the shorts . if anyone can suggest a good light roast espresso bean in the northern italian style , i'm all ears ! edit : it looks like all coffee prices are going up , so there is a good reason for the price increase . this is the sound of me begrudgingly admitting i was wrong . . . gah ! 
=================
deceitful brand name if you are looking for an actual organic dog food , newman's own is not the way to go . i accidently purchased this thinking it was what it claimed on the front package , only to read the ingredient list to find out that basically everything else but the chicken was organic . with all of the drugs and hormones fed to conventionally raised " food animals " this ingredient is the most important one that should be organic . 
=================
freezer works better this product is a waste of time . i have been getting far better results freezing my own poop using my ordinairy under counter freezer ! why would you wait for the dog to go ? pointless ! 
=================
flavor doesn't last very long , but this is still the best sugar - free gum i've found ( so far ) i'll agree with another reviewer here that flavor longevity could be improved , but i also have to say that i don't see trident as a viable , sugar - free gum alternative at this time . many gum - makers are starting to embrace the benefits of xylitol and incorporate the ingredient into their product lines , but most of them ( trident included ) supplement the sweetener with either sucralose ( splenda ) or aspartame ( nutrasweet , equal ) , both of which are toxic and are responsible for many ill side - effects . sucralose is basically chlorinated sugar , chlorine being , basically , bleach . not something one would want to ingest into one's body . aspartame has been on the market longer , and its effects have been well - documented over the years . it contains neurotoxins , including methanol ( which also occurs naturally in fruits along with ethanol and pectin , which greatly slow down its metabolization , greatly decreasing its potency ) that your body metabolizes directly to formaldehyde . among other things , aspartame has been known to cause extreme fatigue , depression , severe headaches , skin diseases , severe muscle weakness , vomiting , bells palsy , and even death ( including among healthy athletes who drink a lot of diet sodas and use energy powders like metrx , both of which include aspartame ) . google " aspartame poisoning " and / or " sucralose poisoning " for more info . so , until someone is able to point out a better tasting xylitol - sweetened gum that includes neither aspartame or sucralose , i'll be buying xylichew .

tastes like . . . if you love super dark , rich , bold and thick flavored coffee then this is the coffee for you . . . with one problem . personally i love coffee that embodies everything i just said . i love esspresso and the like . to find a k - cup that is this bold even on the 10 oz . setting is great . . . but there is that problem again . . . it smells , tastes , and leaves the after taste of burnt urine ! like someone torched a public restroom and mopped the floor with coffee , then packaged it . yum ! there are other dark , bold k - cups out there that have a better smell , flavor and does not have a nasty after taste . you may not believe me , and that is fine , but get a sample pack before going for the 24 , you'll thank me later . try the green mountain coffee extra bold sumatran reserve k - cups . better all around cup of coffee .

problem with amazon shipping i cannot rate the product because i did not open the jar . my problem was with negotiating the amazon purchase . although i tried to get it sent to another address along with several other items , it ended up coming to me instead . the shipping is killer . so i want to warn those out there to read the email amazon sends you carefully , or the same thing may happen to you next time you ship something to an address other than your own . next time i will buy directly from the merchant instead of going through amazon . the shipping was killer . the 2 stars are for amazon's shipping pages .

nabisco premium salteines i have been shopping for nabisco premium saltines and have found them on the shelves but are not the original as the box claims every box that i find proclaims them to be original but stamped on the box it indicates that they are with sea salt ( not original ) . i would like to know if they are still made with salt containing iodine which is a required ingredient for a healthy diet . dietations have indicated that the american ( united states of america ) diet is iodine deficient , therefore , the crackers with sea salt is less healthy for us . where can i find them with iodized salt if they are still made . if they are no longer available shame on you for producing a less healthy food product .

putting pure coconut oil in a plastic container ? ? ? this is awesome coconut oil , but it is packaged in a plastic container . plastic can leech into the product . what is the point of putting a health food in contaminating packaging ? change it ! glass is far more acceptable , and will not will not contaminate the product with the estrogens from plastic . we people who use coconut oil will definitely recycle it , like we do everything else . ; )

quaker has taken themselves out of the instant oats market i love oatmeal , and occasionally make steel - cut oatmeal in my ricemaker , but i've been eating more quaker oats maple & brown sugar instant oatmeal - for years . pallets of it . literally , i had bought lots of " value pack " 24 - packs the last time they went on sale at shop rite , and when i finally ran out , a couple months ago , i bought the " new " improved package at stop & shop . the new flavor is horrible - not just compared to the original , or to mccanns , but truly horrible . i couldn't finish it . tasted a little like coffee grounds . even adding brown sugar or a little milk didn't change it at all . how could you screw up a decades old favorite like that ? why not offer it as a new product , and leave your loyal customer's with their proven favorites ? ( why didn't coca - cola just release " new coke " in the '80s , instead of screwing up their brand loyalty ? and why didn't quaker learn from coke ? ) since then , i've been buying the stop & shop brand , and it's not bad . not as good as the original quaker oats maple & brown sugar , but good enough . quaker has effectively removed themselves from the instant oatmeal market , in my opinion . hope they correct their mistake , but i don't think that happens very often . i'll be waiting for one of those " we heard you , and we're making it right " commercials . . . until then , it's store - brand oats for me .

supply shortage so product coming from sri lanka not thailand i love their product from thailand . i don't like the product from sri lanka . the content of coconut oil is higher in sri lanka made coco milk , throwing off the consistency . i don't want to have to warm the coconut oil prior to using in a cold smoothie , it will just chunk up anyway . wrote the manufacturer - here's the replyfrom the manufacturer : thank you for writing . due to worldwide surging demand for coconutmilk during its lean harvest season , our primary organic packer inthailand is unable to keep up with our volume of sales . therefore wehave added a trusted organic coconut facility in sri lanka as oursecondary supplier . unfortunately , sri lanka uses a slightly differentprocessing method than thailand does and the sri lankan product hasmore tendency to separate when its temperature falls below 80 degreesf . this makes the milk appear curdled as the coconut fat separatesfrom the liquid . such separation is harmless and easily remedied byplacing the can of coconut milk in hot water for 15 minutes and thenstirring the contents thoroughly . we regret this inconvenience , especially since consumers have come to really value the smoother , creamier consistency of our native forest organic coconut milk . whileall natural and organic coconut milk will separate in cooltemperatures , the thailand milk is more smooth and homogeneous . facedwith lengthy stock shortages during an exceptionally lean coconutseason , we decided to accept the different coconut milk consistenciesfrom two supply lines rather than have no organic coconut milk at allduring this six month lean period . we are only shipping thai sourcedcoconut milkas of right now , but distributors and stores may still have sri lankansourced product . thank you for your patience and your understanding . sincerely , joanna freetedward & sons trading co . , inc .

pocky is good but . . best to check out your local asian food market or japanse anime store . the price will usually be better , considering s & h , and you won't be stuck with 6x of something you end up hating . also there are a lot of other varieties of pocky than what's being sold here . there's even " giant " pocky , " custard " pocky , " green tea " etc . . . always more new ones coming out . but , if there are no market or if other internet stores are comparable in price , than maybe a wise choice for the curious snacker . beware though , even i didn't like the sesame . and fyi , men's pocky is just " bitter " instead of " milk " chocolate . best flavors in my opinion ( and most novice pocky snackers like ) : men's , strawberry with / without extra bits , almond crush .

taste good but much higher in sodium than mainstream brands i thought i was getting a healthy alternative to cheese its and cheese nips . but after comparing the labels , i was surprised to see that the back to nature ones have basically the same ingredients ( nothing organic ) and much more sodium than the major brands . seems they just put regular crackers in a 'healthy' looking box and got away with charging a premium .

if the rope breaks , it can be salvaged ! i purchased this product hoping that the " bullet proof like material " would last longer than the other toys i'd purchased for my 8 month old lab . he's a chewer , and within an hour had the rubber - rope gnawed in two . but someone posted a photo of the modification they made post - rope that saved the day : inserting a tennis ball into the bottle . amazing idea ! whom ever came up with that should write the company and suggest the modification . he can't get through the bottle , and the ball blocks the hole enough to where he really has to try to get the treat out . it is loud , but this is the first toy to survive my lab . if it's lab proof , i'm sure it can survive anything !

poor documentation , is this really raw pure honey ? from the recent reviews mine will not be popular . 1 . this honey is incredibly expensive for a very small amount , even less than noted in the ad . 2 . i buy unfiltered , unheated , unprocesseed raw honey from many countries and areas all must be without proximity to flowers with pesticides and or abominations . this honey states ( if you can wade through the umf stuff , in very small print , that it is filtered to remove particles . i want the pieces of comb , i want the pieces of pollen , i want the natural particles that came from the comb to the jar - the pure enzymes etc . further , this honey is heated albeit limited according to the fine print . 3 . the material in the four page pamphlet is very limited focusing on the umf + 20 designation which is supposedly very important . the first page is just pictures and the name of the honey and company . the second page is white small print on a pale yellow background which makes for very difficult reading . i like that the honey comes from isolate protected trees far from any farming and contaminants . the third and fourth pages are more on this umf + 20 stuff . 5 . taste - the honey , if you are new to it , has very distinctive flavor because of the unique tree from which the honey is collected . it has a slight off ( a hint of bitterness maybe ) flavor . i liked it . overall you get limited clear information on how they process the honey , and the cost is outragous compared to many other raw , unfiltered , unheated , unprocessed comb to jar honey where you get four or more times as much at a fraction of the cost with most if not all the same health healing benefits . also , the brochures talks about the lack of peroxcides . i have never heard of this before and question what it means in a practical sense . i will not buy again .

good on the pinch , strange on the taste buds this cornbread mix is very easy to make ( just add water ) and i can appreciate that . flavor is mild corn , kinda gritty texture , and has a strange aftertaste . i bought mine from the grocery store , but i won't get it again .

good but subjectively not 5 star i realize that taste is a matter of personal preference so food reviews are always going to be hit or miss for your tastes . got the cookies , liked them but they didn't quite send me the way other folks seem to take to them . not bad and i don't feel i wasted my money but i'll probably look for something else next time i'm ordering snacks for work .

depends upon your use of them after watching a dr . oz special which lauded the digestive effects of caraway seeds , i ran to my computer to order some immediately . the idea that ingesting a half a handful of seeds would cure me of excessive gas and bloat had me excited beyond words , until i received them in the mail and shoved them in my mouth . . . word to the wise , do not eat caraway seeds by the handful - you may choke to death , but even worse , you may not . picture a day at the farm , walking through the stables . . . now picture picking up some straw and shoving it into your mouth . . . that would be preferable to chewing craway seeds . the best parallel to eating caraway seeds would be if you went to woodshop , picked up the carvings , mixed it with dirt and pepper and chewed . now that doesn't mean that you shouldn't buy them , but be aware they need to be an ingredient . . . like if you want to bake your own rye , although , that seems foolhardy since rye bread is cheap .

it's all bs class litigation should be illegal . maybe there was a time and place , but these days it's designed to just make lawyers richer . it has nothing to do with product safety . the people claiming to have had the dressing tested , by labs no less , did they mention if they used " fda approved labs or testing methods ? " no , didn't think so . this is a california bunch doing this , you know , the land of litigation . this is a prime reason why businesses and people are leaving the state in droves . this practice is dishonest and should be outlawed , but in a state owned and operated by liberals , well . . . good luck . personally , i have to get out of here . i am too damned honest to be a californian .

1 star based only on bad packaging : ( maybe ordering this product in august was a bad move on my part , but i never stopped to consider that heat would affect the shipment the way it did mine . even though the jar is factory - sealed and there is a foil seal inside , it still leaked out ! ! the product was shipped via the usps in a bubble envelope . the product was shoved into my metal mailbox on its side and left to bake in the 90 - degree heat , and when we opened the mailbox we were surprised to see that even the bubble envelope was covered in oil , thereby leaking oil onto the rest of our mail . i opened up the envelope over a trashcan and retrieved the jar of coconut oil with a towel ( for both gripping and cleaning purposes ) , and about 1 / 3 of the product had leaked out . yes , somehow a factory - sealed jar with a foil seal which was shipped inside a plastic bubble - wrap lined envelope still managed to seep out and leave a gooey mess all over the rest of our mail ! i can't attest to whether or not this product is any good because i decided to throw it out . i will say , however , that even though the oil didn't quickly absorb into my skin ( as some people say it does ) , after i washed my hands i noticed that my skin felt a bit softer . always a silver lining in every cloud - - haha ! i'm pretty disappointed because i really wanted to try this product based on all of the great reviews it received , so maybe i'll order again in the winter . i think it should be shipped in a box rather than an envelope , though , as it stands a better chance of being delivered upright that way . 
=================
watch the packaging - 4 to an envelope what i was expecting were individually wrapped tea bags . they come 4 to an envelope , so once you open it the others are exposed to the air . they definitely can not be used in a public setting where no one knows who originally opened it or how long it has been open . i suppose they would be good for batch brewing at home .

terrible flavors , but good variety we received a sodastream for christmas this year . i bought this variety pack so i could sample the various flavors without having to invest in a large bottle of each . i'm grateful that i bought this variety pack or my house would now be full of large bottles of disgusting flavored syrup . there are 6 regular flavors and 6 diet flavors . the flavor selection is good . we were so excited to try them . for us , the only flavor that was drinkable was the lemon - lime , which really did taste almost as good as name brand 7 - up . the orange and root beer flavors were disgusting . all of them , except the lemon - lime , left a terrible aftertaste in my mouth . still , this kit was nicely packaged and the kids did have a lot of fun trying out the different flavors . i just wish they would have tasted better !

absolutely odor - free since i first used this product , i won't use any other brand . it seems my local pet and grocery stores can't keep it in stock , so i just order it every month through amazon . this product doesn't try to mask catbox odors with equally bad floral odors . instead , the real green tea used in this product seems to absorb the bad odors , leaving no odor at all . what a relief .

it's tasty , but crystal light flavors are almost all awful , but this one tastes ok . i don't notice the aftertaste most others mention , very much . it does have a number of ingredients that are bad for you . there's a failing grade for a typical crystal light product on another site because of these dubious chems - foodfacts dot com . and be warned about this chem - drink : if you fill one dixie cup with water , and another dixie cup with crystal light mojito drink , and leave them for 24 hours , the water will be contained in the morning , but the crystal light will have begun to eat through the glue of the same cup , and begun leaking . and . . . when that stain dries , it leaves a green flaky residue . not very cool or appetizing .

made my baby gag ! my 7 - month old son was recently diagnosed ( through blood tests ) with a milk allergy . he's had bad cradle cap and eczema on his face since he was about two months old . after trying many other formulas ( enfamil , good start gentle plus , good start soy , similac advance , baby's only soy ) , the doctor finally suggested going hypoallergenic . so we tried nutramigen . . . he seemed okay for the first couple of minutes , then he pulled the bottle out of his mouth and gagged . i tried again . . . and again , he drank for a minute or two , then gagged again . then he refused to drink any more . after reading up on hypo formulas i was expecting a bad smell , but i didn't think it'd be bad enough to make my son want to hurl ! my son never had any problems drinking all of the other formulas ; this is the only one that actually made him gag . maybe if i had started it earlier when his tastebuds were more immature , i would've had more success . i'm hesitant to give him the alimentum because of the high sugar content . i guess my son will just have to continue suffering with rashes until i can find a formula that works for him . : (

too many mediocre ginger ale / beers have jumped on bandwagon this is another example of a mediocre at best ginger ale dressed up with fancy packaging at a ridiculous price while not even coming close the complexity or intensity of many of the better ginger beers . unfortunately , amazon places you in a paradox in buying some of the better ones . the top two aren't carried by amazon at all but amazon does carry some decent ones . aside from the two that are 5 star and will go unnamed as they are already too difficult to get and sticking w / those that have free shipping since w / o free shipping , you are likely to pay well more for the s / h than the actual product . loathe that i am to admit it , bruce cost's is pretty good - not nearly as good as it should be given the alternatives and he screws some them up with flavoring , which ; to my mind is like taking peet's french roast and trying to get a hazelnut / vanilla flavor to it . but he fancies himself the guru of all things asian ( as far as i know , he is the only one who shares that opinion ) and the rhizome ginger is asian so he makes a 12 pack and charges $ 50 for it . all of the british ginger ale is no better than canada dry ( who used absolutely no ginger in its ginger ale until the past couple of years ) so skip the fever tree . bermuda ginger beer is frequently very good and amazon has had a few . i believe regatta is from bermuda but as a form of torture with which tantalus would be familiar , amazon generally offers the diet with free shipping and the stuff that tastes good with exorbitant shipping . blenheim is a marketing campaign , they know that many of the better ginger beers are spicy so they make a spectrum of spicy gbs , but they are one dimensional , heat only . two of the better known brands , reed's and boylan's don't appeal to me . when they were the only premium gbs on the market , i drank them but i don't think either makes the top ten anymore . two good ones in bottles that amazon carries w / o s / h are saranac & eli's , neither are cheap but it's delivered to your door and includes what we in ca have to pay as crv and s / h are generally free . now for the best deals amazon offers . bottles are expensive to ship so that cost will , to some extent at least , be built in somewhere . in some cases it's worth it . the two best bottled gbs that amazon carries that are usually free s / h are 1 ) a j stephen's ( sp ? ) and 2 ) cock & bull which , urban legend has it as being brewed specifically for the brown derby restaurant , an la icon and is called for by name in a cocktail named the moscow mule . can's are significantly cheaper to ship and i have 3 recommendations for them . i keep a variety of strengths of ginger juice , grated fresh ginger , & ginger syrup so i can sometimes salvage a gb that is a little too bland . that is the case with santa cruz organic gb , it's almost good ( by which i mean far better than schwepps or canada dry but not top tier . if you have some ginger extracts around you can get it pretty good . occasionally , amazon will have the ginger people's product with free shipping . that's definitely worth a look as it has pieces of ginger still floating in it . the single best deal on amazon , in my estimation , is barr's . it's canned so you can get a reasonably priced 24 pack , usually with free s / h . the problem is that amazon is more often sold out than not . i probably wouldn't have mentioned it if i didn't already have 3 cases en route to my house . i haven't seen it often enough to get around to studying it's heritage but it's the best tasting canned ginger beer i've ever had - and at a great price . i think the single best deal for consuming on a daily basis is vernors . i occasionally can find it on sale at $ 2 . 99 a six pack . i don't think i've ever seen a great deal on amazon but if they offered free shipping on vernors , i'd probably get a couple cases a month . it's a little sweet and not really gingery / pungent as the best but can be a great deal . i confess to knowing not very much about jamaican gb . i've tried idris and it's pretty good . most of the jamaican stuff on amazon seems to be in 64 oz . 1 / 2 gallons , plastic and i'm not too fond of that . well that my not very humble opinion . i'm going to have a 12 oz . bottle of my favorite . i'm not going to share the name online but if i get an email ( besides hate mail ) i'll tell you . of course i may be the only one in this country this fanatical about a soft drink so i won't expect an overflowing in box . do yourself a favor , though , skip canada dry - unless you need a mixer or have a sick kid . 
=================
i ask you , what is the point ? seriously . my wife nabbed this at the store the other day because our girls are in love with nutella and she thought this might be a nice change of pace for them . the idea of chocolate peanut butter is not a new one . just open your eyes and look at the cookie aisle in any grocery store . they are lined wall to wall with chocolate peanut butter flavored cookies . it's like the most popular flavor on the market . i , honestly , am not always a fan and wish that there was more variety out there , but whatever . the masses have spoken and ` chocolate and peanut butter' are a ` thing' that just won't go away anytime soon . this product though , doesn't utilize that flavor very well . in fact , all we are left with is peanut butter that is the consistency of melted chocolate . i don't taste the chocolate at all . instead it's like really sticky peanut butter . i guess the only real taste difference is that it is a cloyingly sweet variation of your standard peanut butter . i don't like this . my kids liked it , sure . it is basically dessert , and if you like peanut butter you won't be offended by this , but i don't see a point to this product at all .

mixed review here first , let me say that this is one of my wife's favorite coffees . that having been said , i cannot begin to understand why . i can't even stand the smell of it brewing , and i like irish cream flavored coffee . bottom line , i guess you'll just have to try it for yourself . i would suggest trying to find a smaller amount somewhere before you commit to 50 cups . if gloria jean ever starts selling irish creme k - cups again , timothy's version will die off very quickly , because it can't begin to compare with gloria's .

great chocolate , not so great marzipanthis this candy had a great chocolate covering but the marzipan was lacking in texture ( too runny ) and flavor . it could be it was overpowered by the chocolate since the almond scent and flavor is fairly delicate . it came simply but beautifully wrapped and the candy was very attractive to look at . if you want true marzipan flavor , go somewhere else .

folgers does it better ! i thought that this new invention was genius . . . a brew that can be made using coffee in something that looks like a tea bag . i had tried folgers coffee singles and all i needed was one bag instead of two , like i do with this product . the flavor was also actually really good for being folgers . i saw maxwell house coffee singles at big lots and bought two boxes . . . at $ 2 . 50 it was a bargain because folgers goes for $ 6 . 00 at cvs . boy was i disappointed ! this brew actually tastes woody and old . the coffee is also weak and possibly requires three bags to make a decent strong cup . can't wait to go through these two boxes and never buy it again . nescafe clasico actually does a better job at a cup of joe . if you like a cup of brownish water then this product is for you .

least favorite of the new taco bell sauces i have actually tried all three new taco bell sauces , the jalape & ntilde ; o which i am reviewing now , and also the spicy ranchero and the chipotle sauces . of the three , the jalapeno is my least favorite because it has the flavor that seems to miss the mark . it's got a little spice in a creamy base but it just doesn't seem to mesh together well . maybe because it's refridgerated and if it's going to be creamy and spicy i'd prefer to have it warm . it just does not seem to work well and i can't figure out what food this sauce would taste best with . the label says to use it on taco salads and tacos and things like that . and you could use it on fries . . . . but i am not sure that it would taste all that great considering there are so many other options . i would urge you to try one of the other two new taco bell sauce flavors first , the spicy ranchero or the chipotle . both of those were much better in my opinion . the bottles are squeeze bottles but i found that they don't squeeze out easily once you are half way done with the bottle . you have to store upside down in the fridge or be forced to really shake the bottle to get the sauce to be forced down the the top . sauces are thicker than traditional salad dressings . 
=================
i will urge my local store to stop carrying this i think there is no such thing as a " good " or " bad " food . however , i believe there are foods that i would choose to eat again and those i would not . this is the latter . russian prison food i know not , nor dickensian gruel , but the food served by the 3rd infantry division during the mid - 70's nadir of its morale on snowy evening german logging roads is fondly remembered compared to this . and i'm afraid , like another early reviewer said , its smell reminded me of pet food . 
=================
good meal ( not vegan though ) its a decent vegetarian meal . i gave it one star only because it has dairy and i am looking for vegan foods . it tasted okay .

a total scam i am thorougly disgusted with betty crocker for this product ( gluten - free bisquick ) , which is a shame , because i do applaud them for their excellent cake , cookie , and brownie mixes . i'm not upset with them for for coming out with a gluten - free baking mix , but for : # 1 ) marketing it as though it's an equivalent to bisquick and # 2 ) for pricing it so ridiculously high . ingredients for regular bisquick : enriched flour , partiallly hydrogenated soybean and / or cottonseed oil , leavening , dextrose , salt . ingredients for gluten - free bisquick : rice flour , sugar , leavening ( baking soda , sodium aluminum phosphate , monocalcium phosphate ) , modified potato starch , salt , xanthan gumnotice anything missing from the ingredients of gluten - free bisquick ? yup , that's right - - there's no shortening ( or oil ) . that was the whole point of the original bisquick - - a baking mix that already had the shortening mixed in . that avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits that is why people buy baking mixes - - for that specific convenience . betty crocker has decided to leave out the shortening ( or oil ) altogether , even though shortening ( or oil ) is always naturally gluten - free . so they can't pretend it's a safety - for - celiacs factor . it's a cost - savings to them , pure and simple . here's the breakdown of what you're paying $ 5 a pound for : rice flour ( 99 cents a pound at my local asian store ) , sugar ( $ 2 . 88 for a 5 pound bag at walmart ) , potato starch ( also 99 cents a pound at the asian store ) , baking powder ( $ 3 . 19 a pound at emergency essentials ) , salt ( $ 2 for 26 ounces of morton's ) , xanthan gum ( $ 10 . 45 for 4 ounce on amazon ) . yes , xanthan gum is expensive - - but very , very little is needed ; a 16 - ounce box of gluten - free bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum - - maybe 20 cents' worth of xanthan gum . betty crocker is charging over 5 times what it would cost you to make their " mix " at home , while eliminating the major convenience factor ( and cost to themselves , but not to you ) of their regular baking mix . i don't mind their making a fair profit , especially if the product really were the equivalent of regular bisquick . but they're gouging us , and being misleading about the product . make your own , easily , and for less than 20 % of what they charge ! since there's no oil in gluten - free bisquick , you can easily stir up an equivalent , make 5 pounds ( or more ! ) at a time , with very little effort , and it will keep for several months . or , if you want a real bisquick substitutes , betterbatter . org has a recipe on the site for a cup - for - cup substitute for bisquick that does use shortening and non - fat dry milk powder . or you can use buttermilk powder , or even vance's dairy - free powder . it makes 10 cups at a time , stores well , and you don't have to use their gluten - free flour - - you can use any gluten - free flour replacement you want ( like rice flour and potato starch from your local asian store , mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum , about 1 / 2 teaspoon for every two cups ) . to find the recipe , do a google search of " betterbatter bisquick substitute master mix . " boo on betty crocker .

read the ingredients carefully there was a guy promoting these chocolate bars today and giving samples at whole foods . i overheard him talking about stevia and i approached somewhat curious . he invited me to try some of the flavors and i tried a tiny bite of the almond and coconut . i remarked it was impressive that they were really sweetened only with stevia . if you look on the front of the package it says " sweetened with stevia " . he smiled and nodded and told me about how fast they were selling them . everyone loves them . i said great , i will buy 2 bars , and off i went . now home with my reading glasses on i am reading the ingredient label . these are the ingredients on the label ( of the coconut flavor lily's dark chocolate bar : unsweetened chocolateinulindextrin ( from non - gmo corn ) erythritolcocoa butterorganic coconutmilkfatsoy lecithinnatural flavorsstevia extractnatural vanillainulin , dextrin ( from non - gmo corn ) and erythritol are featured a little too high on the list to make this food product i would consider . hardly a " whole " or " natural food " in my opinion . dextrin ( which i had to google and is made by heating corn starch at a very high heat over an extending time and seems to be used in pyrotechnics and firecrackers , among other things ) is the 3rd ingredient ! notice where stevia is on the list . it seems that erythritol is the primary sweetener , which i guess sounds a lot less sexy . stevia people associate with the herb , even though the extract is highly processed . read carefully before you buy , even at whole foods market . it seems this product is being marketed in 2 primary ways : as an " all natural " and " sugar free " stevia sweetened chocolate candy bar & through an association with the namesake , a little girl named lily who had brain cancer as a child . " the company gives a portion of profits to non - profits that help childhood cancer survivors in honor of co - founder chuck genuardi's niece lily , who battled childhood brain cancer . " . of course it is wonderful that a portion of profits will help childhood cancer survivors in lily's honor . and it feels good to have our buying dollars support a good cause . i would just like to know what that means a little more precisely . like , what portion of profits and how will it help " childhood cancer survivors " ? if you are making an association like this , make it clear to make it credible . again , i am not implying any wrong here , it's just " fuzzy " and more so because of the ingredient label as far as i'm concerned , and the way it is being promoted . 
=================
unexpected , very mild flavor . i do a lot of stirfry and sesame oil is a very easy way to get a nice taste and smell with very little . just opening the bottle , i knew it was already a dud . used it and it was so bland , i wish i would have been a little less lazy and had just found an asian market nearby to buy some more sesame oil . won't make the same mistake twice ! 
=================
picture and description do not agree which is it ? picture and description do not agree which is it ? i am looking for newman's own organinc extra boldsecond generation ( same as picture ) but the description states medium roast . are they both the same or is the picture and description two different coffees ? 
=================
not so great flavor ! not so great lemon flavor ! it's very hard to find soy free ! this is a great brand ! i prefer the ginger much better taste ! 
=================
okay not a lot of flavor in this item , but i like the idea of the natural ingredents

flavor doesn't last long gum tastes good but flavor does not last long . they need to improve the gum and make the pieces bigger .

rating on taste & effect on thought , not price i did not buy a case of this , i bought a couple at sunflower markets to try out . in spite of what i've read others say , it tastes good . however , it's not like your buying this for something tasty . it helps me when i drink this , as i have a brain fog that tides away for the most part when i drink this . i've stopped and it slowly comes back . that being said , for $ 2 . 00 - $ 2 . 50 / daily , a little expensive for 8 . 4 oz . ( 1 cup ) at sunflower markets , it was 2 for 5 . 00 , which is where i got the $ 2 . 50 price tag . you figure 1 month being 30 days , $ 2 would be $ 60 . then again , i guess some people do smoke cigarettes at around $ 50 / carton , so it's not a far stretch for some . . . 
=================
kinda strange these are odd but i don't hate them . i really prefer soft cookies to hard ones . they're small and have a powdery peach flavored coating on them . they remind me a little of the lemon girl scout cookies but peach flavored . the gf didn't like them . gave the rest as gifts for christmas . suckas .

i hate to say " me , too " , but . . . i recently purchased my first keurig machine , the b60 model ( which is wonderful , by the way ) , and my machine was one of those " bonus packages " that came with a small variety sampler pack ( 12 k - cups ) . having gone through most of this fantastic assortment already , i decided to order a variety assortment from amazon . i read all the reviews - - positive and negative - - and decided to take a chance on this one . it arrived today , and although there are some neat flavors that i am anxious to try , there is very little variety . i ordered the 24 - count sampler . out of these , 4 k - cups are truly unique / limited edition flavors that are not green mountain . that leaves 20 k - cups of green mountain that either french vanilla ( the majority ) , caramel vanilla cream , blueberry or hazelnut . luckily , these are at least flavors i like , they are just not all that unique . probably won't order from these folks again , due to the lack of variety . i was really hoping for more choices , like the one that came with my keurig ( the sampler pack had 12 different coffees from all different coffee companies , some i hadn't heard of and were quite good ) . i hate to whine , but my morning cup is a very important part of my day ! too bad . . . if you like french vanilla with a few surprises thrown in , then this assortment is for you , but not if you are looking for a true variety . 
=================
i didn't get what y'all got . . . big starbucks fan , via fan , but this christmas blend via isn't very good for me . now , i'm not one of those super strong coffee people , but this is also a little bitter in my opinion . i will say that if you use about 16 oz . and some milk and some vanilla , it's okay . i see now why they were having a sale on it at starbucks . i'd got with the caramel via instead , that's the bomb , as is the vanilla . 
=================
one of the best k cups , but buy elsewhere ! if you enjoy dark or " extra bold " k cups , then this is for you . i've tried just about all of the dark and darker k cups , ( that i know of ) , and this is one of the few that i will continually repurchase . that said , this seller is counting on the foolish or uninformed to sell this online , as it is a sub - brand that is unique to target . ( as in the store . . . ) apparently , caribou , ( who is now owned outright by green mountain ) created obsidian specifically for target , as it is not even mentioned on the caribou website . anyway , the " everyday " price $ 11 . 99 , but it often " on sale " for less - once even $ 8 . 99 . just to be fair , i guess you could continue to buy it through amazon - please note that this is not sold by amazon - for more than twice the price . guess where they , ( my favorite things , llc - aka amazon reseller dejour ) , are getting it from ?

addictive , empty filler , but my cat went anorexic without it my older cat , 4 years , got " hooked " on hill's science diet kitten formula when i brought a new kitten , along with a big bag of free s / d , home from the pound . [ prior to that , my well - adjusted cat would eat raw chicken , high quality canned foods , organic kibble - - all the " good stuff " ] both cats thrived on s / d . so much so that the kitten grew and grew and grew , into a hefty 9 pounds at 7 months . the 4 year - old cat began ignoring her own food and started eating the kitten's food . she filled out , also , but to a nice adult weight of 6 pounds . okay , so 2 months later the kitten is up to 10 pounds and can barely walk without panting . she cannot stop eating this s / d stuff . she's enormous , way bigger than her 4 year - old housemate . i decide to switch back to the healthier food - - like innova evo , which is 88 % meat protein and grain free . i also augment with superior wet food ( the 100 % organic , human grade stuff , along with raw chicken , etc ) . kitten is okay with that switch - - like a tiger she tears away at the raw chicken , gulps at the premium can food - - but the older cat doesn't like it , although i do it very gradually over 3 months . i sit with her , pet her , calm her . . . yes , she does eat , just not much - - a few kibble crunches , or a tablespoon of wet food . [ cornell has over 300 studies on anorexic cats ] . a couple months go by and the kitten is looking better , not panting as much ( and 2 pounds lighter ) but our 4 year - old cat is now down to 2 . 9 pounds ! all her ribs show and she has bones where her shoulders are . she looks like a cheetah that's been deprived of food . no mater what food i put in front of her - - dry , wet , kibble , shredded meat - - she will only nibble bits and pieces , here and there . her fur has lost its glossy coat . the vet tells me i have to do something , anything , to stop the decline in my cat's health , even if it means feeding the crummy science diet kitten food , original formula . i am two days into feeding the cat the s / d kitten food . she is wolfing this stuff down as if there's no tomorrow . it makes me sad that she's become another s / d addict - - it's that darn corn filler , converts to sugar and cats love it . i know , i'd rather have her alive and eating this crud , then wasting to nothing away on more nourishing food . at least i can console myself that the kitten knows she's a feline and eats like one .

coffee drinks gf international coffee is great and handy in this size container , however , much cheaper in the local stores , even though you need to purchase smaller containers . sorry , this did not save me any money . 
=================
just what a dog needs ? why is this in my quick picks ? i don't even own a dog ! but just from reading the ingredients , i say give this stuff a pass . it has potato , tomato , peas , blueberries and raspberries in it , none of which are a part of a dog's natural diet . canines of all kinds get all the nutrition required in the wild just from eating meat . anything else is just filler . 
=================
not good enough for me to make the switch this 100 % juice , carbonated beverage is a good alternative to traditional soda . as a somewhat health - conscious consumer , i avoid high fructose corn syrup ( hfcs ) as much as possible . this beverage contains no hfcs , no added sugar , no preservatives , and no added color . i'm sampling the orange flavor . it contains 100 % of your daily recommended dose of vitamin c , and 20 % of your vitamin a for the day . the downside is a single 8 . 3 fl oz can contains almost as many calories as a 12 oz a can of soda . the orange - tangerine flavor reminds me a bit of orangina . perhaps you've tried crystal geyser's fruit squeeze beverages which are also similar . it's definitely not comparable to artificially flavored orange beverages ( sunkist , crush ) . it has a hint of grapefruit - like taste to it , but without the bitterness , which may be due to the added apple , grape , and acerola concentrates . the aftertaste is a bit metallic to me . the beverage itself is clear - without pulp of any kind - and is light - orange - yellow in color . this is a good alternative to those looking for something soda - like , but healthier than all the hfcs - loaded options . maybe it's a good option for parents to give to their kids if their kids drink a lot of soda anyway . personally , i don't enjoy it enough to buy it instead of other available , similar products . if i want orange juice or crave soda , i'll rather drink the real thing . 
=================
good chocolate , but price scam honestly , i should stop my automatic one - stop - easy - shop addiction shopping at amazon . this is just another example of purchasing at amazon a product that , after the fact , i find in several other places for a much lower price . in fact , amazon's " sale " of 2 boxes for $ [ . . . ] , is more than the regular price at several other stores . additionally , the packages came with big stickers " ready for shipment , " on them which were not easy to peel off ( makes for tacky looking gifts ) . search elsewhere . you'll find you'll save money . these are tasty , however . we've had them before and enjoyed them . 
=================
excellent mix , rancid nuts i loved this trail mix , but the nuts in all the bags were spoiled ( i assume because of amazon storage ? ) . really disappointing because i'd love to order this product again at this price . 
=================
these came full of ants ! ewwwwww when these arrived , the box was full of ants . i had to throw the whole thing away . very disappointing ! : o ( 
=================
every can was damaged - what are they trying to pull our dog loves this dog food . but , after my experience with ordering this product online through amazon the dog may not get it again , as i am not only upset with amazon for allowing it , but also the manufacturer who passes on their damaged cans to the public through an online site . i ordered a case of this product and every can in the shipment has large dents in the can . and because of the location of the dents , on the inside cans , in the packaging , you can tell it wasn't damage done during shipping . these cans we packed that way . never again will i order anything like this online . it has actually soured me on using amazon . 
=================
irritated my forehead i have more sensitive skin than do most people , which may have something to do with why this product doesn't suite me . it irritated my forehead directly in front of my hair when i tried washing with it . after two tries , i gave up on it . i'm sure this product works wonderfully for some people , but it isn't a good choice for me . 
=================
blek i love panda regular black licorice but grabbed this one by mistake at the grocery store . blek . . . i had to throw the box away after managing to eat half . licorice has a strong flavor but the herbs in this formula make you forget there's any licorice in it . 
=================
my puppy likes purina better my puppy was on royal canin but we switched her to wellness pupy b / c i eventually wanted her on wellness core but she doesn't seem to like it . i have to mix the can with it in order for her to eat it . she was with a dog sitter for a week while we were out of the country and she came back with her food container full . she seemed more solid , like she'd gained a lot more weight in just a week . apparently she ate their dog food and wouldn't touch her more expensive food . now that she's home , she's gone back to barely eating it . i'll try another brand after we finish this bag . i'm sure the nutrition in it is great but if i can't get my dog to eat it , what good is it ? 
=================
amazing mustard but riduculous shipping charge i absolutely love this mustard - hands down my favorite . but - almost $ 10 for shipping . that is just riduculous and a total rip - off . would never spend that kind of money for a jar of mustard , no matter how amazing it is . 
=================
good , but these aren't caramels i was disappointed that these are not caramels - the description should read " caramel - flavored hard candies " as that is what these are . however , i was not disappointed in the taste - these are made of largely natural ingredients , and they taste like it . the " liquid honey " center is more chewy than liquidy . texturally these are not really as described - but again they taste good . a for " energy " , energy is in this context a synonym for calories , and the small number of calories per piece is not going to do much . the vitamin content is okay - about 1 / 3 of the rda for 3 main vitamins - but using these to get your requirements could be pricey . so , i like the taste , i like the natural ingredients , and these are a healthier substitute for candy , but they aren't a great source of energy or vitamins . i'd buy these , but mostly for the taste rather than the nutritional claims . 
=================
too expensive to be a " treat " the product came attractively packaged in a vacuum packed flat resealable plastic pouch . the tuna had a strong tuna smell , which immediately brought our cats running over to inspect . at 4 . 1 ounces , this is more of a meal than a treat . while you could cut off a piece and save the rest for another time , this isn't what i think of when buying kitty treats . . . kitty treats to me are crunchy and small , so that i can shake the container to call our cats over and then sprinkle out a couple of treats at a time . with this prodcut , we replaced our usual fancy feast dinner and served our 2 cats the entire 4 . 1 ounce pouch . i found that it looked a little dry , but i will say that the cats gobbled up the food like it was their last meal . overall , our cats seemed to like it , but i have some issues with the way the product is marketed . if this is to be used as a treat , it needs to be easier to serve in small pieces . if it is to be used as a meal , then the price needs to be lowered alot . i would never purchase this product as is . 
=================
works ! when we first got this product my husband was in a hurry and tried just placing it at the top of the gopher holes . 2 days passed and nothing . then when we had time , we went out and installed them correctly , digging out the tunnel and placing it in , then reburying it with some twine attached so we didn't loose it . we left it buried for 24 hours before checking it and sure enough , we had caught the gopher . it looked like it would be pretty nasty to try and get the gopher off the trap so we just buried the whole thing . we still had another trap if needed and at this cheap price , i didn't mind . 
=================
no problems ! we use these in our kitchen garbage can and have had no problems - - no rips / tears or leaks . highly recommended !

sweet & carbonated ~ nice , but not for everyone i like this 'kiwi berry' more than the 'watermelon strawberry' i reviewed previously : it's less sweet , but still a little too sweet for me . it advertises 'no sugar added' and '100 % juice carbonated' , so i was expecting somewhat sweet tasting , but not like this ~ it was too sweet , and packed 135 calories , 36g sugar and 34g carbs in a 'no sugar added' - 'no corn syrup' - 'no preservatives' - 'no artificial colors' - 'gluten free' drink ! i would expect that from a juice like apple or cranberry , but i would also expect it to taste natural , and this one ( for all it's claims to the contrary ) still did not taste very natural to me . it was certainly pleasant tasting , but for the tastebuds of someone who was a lifelong soda drinker ( diet soda for the past 12 years ) , and gave up soda completely last may ( i don't miss it at all ! ) , this is not the drink for me . i mostly drink water , milk , iced tea , hot tea & coffee now , and this sweet tasting , sugary tasting beverage , had way too much carbonation & flavoring for me ! the kiwi berry flavors were nice ( much nicer than the watermelon strawberry ) , but still tasted fake , which is weird for a drink that touts things like '100 % juice' and a label that says 'natural flavors' . . . i would recommend this product only to those who like sweet , fruitie carbonated beverages , and aren't too worried about calories , etc . 
=================
good pb - deceptive advertising tastes like pb . . . i guess i'm not as refined as others but it tastes like pb , i'd say it's good . however , the " no stirring needed " is a bit deceptive . it still has oil in it ( i think it's natural in peanuts ) , and if you let it sit awhile , some of it does come to the top . 
=================
this is nuts . pure salt is simply sodium chloride . most of the table salt we eat comes from underground . michigan is a giant salt mine . if you want trace minerals , go buy a cattle lick block for 10 bucks and grind it down . take supplements or eat a balanced diet . the main difference between one salt and another is texture . i prefer flaked kosher salt for my steaks and veggies . 
=================
not a hit in our house . . . so far . i don't like this stuff at all , and most importantly , neither do my cats . i wanted them to get use to a better kind of litter and first tried the yesterday's news only to have them avoid it like the plague . then i thought maybe they would like this if it had a natural fresh scent . hard to say because even when i put a little in one box with their regular litter , which is clay , only one of my 3 will even venture in only to hop right back out . i have 3 cats and have 4 boxes set up for them which are cleaned at least twice daily . . . i know i know , i'm a clean fanatic with that which they are happy about to be honest . anyway , this stuff is bright yellow and has an awful smell to it and it is dusty ! the pieces are so big and i'm guessing it would be uncomfortable to walk on . anyway , i can't picture this one being a winner and will probably try the cedar chips as one last try . after that , i think i'm done trying to fix something that isn't broken . i mean after all , they all use the boxes exclusively so i may just leave well enough alone . if they don't want to be eco friendly , heaven only knows i can't make them . update 12 - 31 - 2011 : after several weeks of trying to entice them to using this , i gave up . i put just a little in one box , out of 4 . . . i have 3 cats , and they all avoided that one . even the one who was most curious about it and had investigated it in the beginning wanted nothing to do with that box . 
=================
finally figured it out i tried these in my senseo machine due to the unavailability of their brand of coffee pods . several attempts and finally got a decent cup of coffee . if you use the single holder and wet the pod first you get stronger coffee with the foam ! these hold more coffee and you get water blow by if they are dry . weak nasty brown stuff that no one would want to drink . tried the double holder with similar results . got the idea for wetting them off the internet . wish i could give the person credit who figured it out !

this snack made me blue this " cookie " bar might have been tastier if dipped in milk or coffee , but eating it alone as a snack it was disaappointing - - dry , crumbly and lacking in juiciness . the serving size was fine , and the calorie - count , appealingly low - - just right for popping in a child's lunchbox or a knapsack when camping . but this tastes too " healthy " to be appeal to most appetites . 
=================
my four cats would not eat this my four cats liked the smell of these treats but they would not eat them . the treat to human eyes is totally unappealing . not only are they freeze - dried raw but they look hairy ( similar to a dust bunny i would find under the bed ) . in size , they are the circumference and height of a double - stuffed oreo cookie . they are also very light and as easy to break up as a wafer . i broke several into smaller bite - sized pieces and left them out overnight . one of my cats looked like he was going to take a bite but eventually walked away . the other three smelled the pieces and left without even trying them . the box of the chicken formula raw boost bites claims these treats are for cats and dogs and are made of chicken , turkey , turkey liver , turkey heart , pumpkinseeds , apples , carrots , ground chicken bone , etc . each large piece is 23 calories and they recommend 1 to 2 pieces per 20 pounds of body weight . however , since my four cats won't eat them , i'm going to throw out all this goodness to the wildlife . maybe some critter will eat it .

tastes much better than kraft i have been trying to steer my family to the organic side of the food chain . they have been resisting . they complain more often than not and i give in more often than i should . so it has been with mac n cheese . annie's sat on the shelf ignored until i donated them . so had a number of other versions . i took a chance on these and ordered a case when the price was good on amazon . the case of 12 got eaten in a month ( it is the fall back dinner that my hubby makes for the kids if i am not around ) . then , yesterday , my husband pulled out the left over kraft box , made it and regretfully told me that it doesn't hold a candle to this stuff . go figure . i think i was speechless for a minute there as kraft has been the torch that nothing else compared to in flavor . came back on here to buy more and it's sold out .

good product , not good vendor this product is a perfect substitute for the syrupy , cloying sweetness used in commercial mocha drinks . it makes a very satisfying home - brewed white mocha espresso drink . i buy it by the case if it is affordable . i purchased this recently from diabeticfriendly llc , who advertised a case at a great price , with shipping at an appropriate $ 29 . 81 . vendor sent me one bottle ( @ $ 10 + yikes ! ! ! over twice the cost of lollicup per bottle ) and charged the amazon shipping rate ( $ 29 . 81 ) for a case of 12 bottles . when i contacted vendor , he got nasty and accused me of trying to rip him off . i had to contact amazon repeatedly , before the vendor refunded , but the vendor continued to send nasty emails calling me names . check out his reviews . . . it looks like he blames the customer when they complain about his high shipping charges . as well they should complain , amazon has set shipping - by - weight that the vendor is required to follow . if the product is listed correctly by the vendor , then shipping should not be in dispute or excessive . i would never have purchased from this vendor if he had listed the product correctly .

i roast them i was disappointed in the taste of these because i like bitter chocolate and these are not at all bitter . also did not care for the texture . it finally dawned on me that what was missing in the nibs was the richness that comes from roasting . so now i roast them - in my oven at 325 it takes 20 minutes . i don't think i'm destroying much of the nutrients in the nibs but even if i am the flavor and texture after roasting is so much improved i don't really care . i make a combination of toasted sesame seeds and roasted nibs mixed into melted unsweetened bakers chocolate , spread out on a pan and put in the freezer until hardened . then i pop it off the pan , break it into pieces , and store in the 'fridge . the taste is downright addicting . the nibs , after roasting , add a true chocolate flavor to everything ( try adding to a can of mixed nuts ) . after roasting they have a pleasing tender crunch to them instead of the very hard waxy texture in the raw state .

aspartame free unless it's just not labeled correctly , this is the only gum i have found ( besides bubble gum ) that does not contain aspartame . i have literally checked every package of gum at all of our stores in town and every single one has aspartame , even the non sugar free ! way to go dentyne classic ! ! 
=================
newsflash : this product does advertise as msg free ! okay , i love this stuff ; it's great to use in numerous dishes as a flavor enhancer . so , why am i writing this review ? because some people on this site like to rant and rave about a product technically having msg . for the record and i have six different flavors of this product , there is no mention of this product being msg free on any of the packaging . okay ? so , stop giving bad reviews to this product because you claim they advertise as msg free . they do not do that , and you are spreading lies . you know who you are ! stop giving this product bad reviews for made up reasons . read the label !

i liked bob's red mill better personally , i prefer the gluten free products from bob's red mill . this one didn't taste as good or as fresh . i will stick with bob's .

fine but don't buy it at $ 35 + $ 7 + for shipping this product can be had for $ 12 for two cans from other vendors . don't get ripped off by the one seller offering it at shameful , ripoff prices here on amazon . do some internet research and be glad you did . normally , i wouldn't mind a bit of a mark - up but 300 % is just shameful . 
=================
ok but i am not a fan of this chocolate - smells good when you open it though not bad but i wouldn't say as good as the hazel nut or vanilla nut but i am not really a chocolate fan . like it but has to be good . 
=================
not bad just like top ramen , but spicier . not too spicy , but not plain either . i'd have this rather than top ramen , if i had to choose . 
=================
not a bad selection i have ordered this variety pack twice , it has good selections and was shipped to me fairly quickly considering it was the holiday rush season . i would purchase this again . note they come shipped in a packing box just thrown in and packed down with brown paper . i counted them and both times they were all there and none of them were expired or damaged upon my inspection . if you can get over the fact there is no appeal to the packaging this supply should do just fine . 
=================
not what is was and almost twice the price as before ! ! ! i've been ordering this for years . the first shipments were amazing . the most wonderful taste and moist and flavorful . the first order i think was in the low $ 20's for 24 cans . now it's almost double . the last shipment was dry and hard and not at all the same as the wonderful tuna i used to get . i won't order this again as it's not the same product it once was . i just looked at the can and it said thailand too . no thanks !

my dog loves this stuff my old dog , who can be a bit of a princess , loves this stuff . the " sirloin " bits are soft and chewy while the other bits are crunchy like traditional kibble . my dog is big , but the bits are small enough that a very small dog would enjoy it as well . i usually wet my dog's kibble ( she doesn't like it dry ) and add a scoop or two of canned food . with this , and because she isn't one of those dogs who immediately eats as much as is put down , i can free - feed her the food without it spoiling . so , it's a success with her . with me , it's almost a success . i'm not crazy that the food contains animal digest which , according to wikipedia , can contain all sorts of things i don't want my dog eating , including product from dead , dying , diseased , or disabled animals . or roadkill , rats , animals euthanized in " shelters . " i don't know what this particular animal digest contains but that is part of the problem . i want to know exactly what is in the food i give my animals . unfortunately , it is hard to find dog food that doesn't have something nasty in it . and also unfortunately , this food isn't an exception to the rule .

greedy dealer cut my coke so , what happens when coca - cola gets involved in a perfectly good all natural tasting drink with all natural ingredients and no big plastic waste ? it gets industrialized of course ! this tastes like some number crunchers worked on lowering the price per unit to boost the profit margin and marketers worked on bottle material and bottle shape with a test group until it scored a good percentile and voila , you get a processed liquid in a plastic bottle . one of their biggest problems with all of this was that their original customers' palates had only experienced pure cw , so we all knew better . we were used to the good stuff and then our dealer got greedy and cut our coke , i mean our coconut water , and they lost alot of buyers to others dealing the pure stuff . now i buy zico in the 33 . 8oz tetrapacks . it's the pure stuff . knowing that zico sometimes reads these reviews i'm wondering out loud here if someone inside zico , with a sense of taste , just has to be saying " i told you so " ever since this version was released . if so many customers hate it you just know that someone inside zico must have hated it too . whoever that discerning person is has since been acknowledged i'm sure . . .

very good , smooth coffee when fresh i got my bag from costco and it was really good . i'm not sure how amazon's version is but the coffee i got was very smooth and not at all acidic or sour as others complained . the batch must have been really fresh since the glass container i put it in would pop every time i opened it . when i roast coffee , this will occur from the gasses being released and expanding . again , i got mine from costco and from my guess , they take orders and have them filled directly from the company , so it was pretty fresh . the price was very decent for organic fair trade as well . even for espressos , latte's and cap's , it's a very nice coffee . highly recommend . suggestion , don't over grind or drink after coffee has been sitting too long , it will get sour and / or bitter . don't buy coffee that's been sitting on shelves too long either . oh yeah , don't ever buy coffee from tjmaxx , marshall's , ross , or home goods ( i know , they're basically the same store ) . every time i've bought a food item from these companies it was horrid ! ! a batch of coffee i got from tjmaxx turned to dust when i tried to grind it ! ? they wouldn't take it back either . even the clothes are irregular , but food items , forgettabboutit .

mediocre is the only appropriate word . . . one of the really big selling points of the keurig brewer was that it produced hot beverages other than just coffee . teas , cappuccinos and hot chocolates were all available and we were eager to try them . i did my research after we got our brewer for christmas , though , and was really disappointed to read a pile of negative reviews for pretty much every hot chocolate brand available . the swiss miss hot chocolate was on sale at our local grocery store so we decided we had to try it . it had ranked a little bit higher than most of the other brands so i held out hope that it would work out . i brewed a small cup when we got home and gave it a shot . the consistency that came out of the machine was nice and the consistency didn't seem watery . this tastes exactly like the no calorie swiss miss hot chocolate available in sleeves . while you're drinking it , it tastes alright , but then it's followed by a very plasticy synthetic aftertaste . there's no mistaking the artificial sweetener here and i can see how that would bother a lot of people , especially those with sensitive taste buds . i think we'll finish the rest of the box , but i'm not convinced we'll repurchase . we'll probably just use the keurig to prepare the water and then use traditional hot chocolate packets .

young thai coconuts coconut water travels well in coconuts . young thai coconuts are a specialty export that provides water directly out of the coconut , assuming the gentle consumer takes the time to figure out how to open the coconut ( hint : youtube ) . finally consider 12 pieces of this product for $ 21 versus 9 pieces of young thai coconuts for maybe $ 8 from 99 ranch , a great chain of asian supermarkets .

love the product , not the price great product , i use this product weekly and it really helps me alot , altho if your body doesnt absorb vitamin b12 well , its probably not going to do much for you . horrible price , find this product at dollar tree , and dollar general for $ 1 each , or get it direct from the manufacturer's website at a cost of $ 9 . 99 for a carton of 12 !

not too bad ! just made my very first gluten - free loaf of bread using bobs red mill flour . definitely not as glorious as a loaf of regular white flour bread fresh out of the oven , but not a terrible substitute . next on the agenda , gluten free pita wraps . i think i can actually live with this new change in diet , even thrive ! already feeling more energy and less anxiety . : ) but i can't speak for everyone as this is the first gluten free flour i have tried .

get ready for a long wait i ordered based on the 5 star review and it's taking 2 months to receive . when i originally placed my order it was showing as available . however it's been a long wait . i was looking for easter candy , might make it to me by fathers day . they need to do a better job of fulfilling their orders , i'm going to be so annoyed by the time i receive it that i'm not going to like it no matter what it tastes like . 
=================
wouldnt order online again only 2 of the cans were in perfect condition - all the others were dented very badly . last time i order cans on line i guess

gives you incentive to work out after 20 min . of drinking when people say " read the directions " , you must . you aren't supposed to ingest the whole bottle . it's meant for 2 servings for 2 separate days . i like going to the gym , but i stress staying on the elliptical , unless i drink only half of this small bottle . i do 60 minutes on elliptical and sweat like crazy . after that , i literally can run on the treadmill for another hour . i did this several times , and i got bad knees and shouldn't be running . this tells you how much stamina you have once drinking half . if you want to lose weight while working out , but can't get yourself to stay in the gym long because of procrastination , lazyness or lack of energy , this is your product . just beware by not becoming addicted to this harsh , liquid drug . i can't have a normal workout without it .

less plastic and better taste ? yes please ! these do not look like regular k - cups . and perhaps they won't keep as long because the bottom looks like it's made of rounded cloth , kind of like a tea bag . but they fit keurig machines just fine , are less expensive , and most importantly i think this coffee tastes better than the coffee in plastic k - cups . i actually prefer the fact that the bottom is not made of plastic . i never liked the idea that my hot coffee was being strained through a plastic cup . in fact , i just ordered more .

not soy milk . . . it is tasty ( like coffee mate which i actually like ) but i'm afraid it's far less nutritious than soy milk or milk - - - - 1 serving ( 23g powder ) has 100 calories but only contains 2g of protein ( 26g of non - fat milk powder contains 9g protein ! ) . and the list of ingredients for this product is long with several long words . . . i will keep it but only as coffee creamer ( to be fair , it is probably healthier than regular coffee creamer . ) buti don't think it is as natural , healthy , and nutritious as soy milk .

not the best brand i've tried the first brand of cedar litter i tried was pet smart's exquisicat cedar litter and like it . then tried feline pine because i found it at walmart for a bit less . but it is much more dusty and scooping it out meant clouds of dust , so i thought that can't be too good for the cats to dig in . switching back to the pet smart brand . i see on the box that it contains some clay , but you'd never know it as the product is light and fragrant .

rustichella makes great pasta . . . . . . but it would be desecration to put this gunk on any decent pasta , let alone rustichella's . jarred pesto is to freshly - made pesto as instant coffee is to freshly - brewed mocha - java from peet's . i've been silly enough to try various brands of pesto in jars , and none of them would glean more than two stars . the frozen brands are marginally better , but the only justification for store - shelf pesto is the unavailability of fresh basil , even then , you'd do better to make a pesto recipe with any soft herb you have : arugula , dandelion , parsley , mashed artichoke . . . if i lived in nunavut i'd probably use lichen from the belly of a caribou rather than depend on jarred pesto . here's a basic pesto recipe for a small batch : 50g of basil leavesextra virgin olive oil6 tbsp grated parmigiano reggiano or grana padano2 tbsp pecorino ( romano , toscano , sardo or siciliano ) 2 cloves of garlic1 tbsp pine nutscoarse sea saltthe traditional method uses a wooden pestle and a marble mortar . start by pounding the garlic and salt until you get a smooth paste . add the basil , a handful at a time , and keep grinding until each batch of the leaves is incorporated . to preserve the essential oils in the basil , don't be too rough with it . add the pine nuts and grind some more . add the cheese and mix well . add the oil , little by little , until the pesto has the right consistency - a matter of taste . serve with pasta or added to minestrone . the recommended pastas are troffie , trofiette or trenette , but it goes with just about any pasta . i usually serve it with spaghetti or linguine . if somebody has an interesting variation , post it as a comment .

cups different having lots of problems with green mountain cups . coffee is fine , but plastic seems heavier than other brands and does not fully drain into cup , but drips considerably when removing to dispose . will probably choose other brands in the future instead . have been using k - cups for over a year and only have had problems with this brand .

i like the concept of an instant coffee . . . . i picked up a package of via out of curiosity . for the record , i am the owner of a coffee roastery and a cafe which has won " coffee bar of the year " for the past 4 years in ct . we roast coffee for other cafes as well so i feel i have a pretty good grasp of what a good coffee should taste like . here's my impression of via : it is certainly easy to prepare . i generally drink a 16oz coffee so i used 2 packets ( they are sized for an 8oz serving ) to prepare my cup . the coffee is ready to drink as soon as it is stirred . i drink my coffee black and what i taste is only the coffee ( my preference for brewing water is a neutral ph of 7 , a langelier index of zero and no chlorine , fluoride , or lime ) . on to the coffee : a good colombian should be very balanced , with good body , brightness * and a nutty flavor . truth be told , most colombian coffee on the market is a bit boring , and most are at best a simply decent , clean cup with almost no aftertaste . unfortunately this is only true if it's fresh * * from a roaster which is unlikely . the via colombian that i tried might have started out as an arabica coffee from the low end of the specialty coffee spectrum . since i don't know the timeline for production , it is very difficult to say how old the coffee was to begin with but there is definitely a " woody " note that i associate with aged beans . the actual flavor might not be terrible if you where able to separate out this woody note but unfortunately via has a very objectionable mouth feel and aftertaste . after a few seconds , there is a very noticeable residue left on your tongue that is bitter and astringent . i typically associate this with a brew that has had coffee grounds siting in it such as when a coffee filter collapses while brewing . bottom line for me : i would drink it only if my only other choice was a widely available and well known " donut " shop coffee ( which i am mystified why anyone would drink . . . just terrible ) . as for the flavored versions of via , i am really not a fan of any flavored coffee since these flavorings are typically unhealthy and serve mostly to mask the objectionable tastes of the coffee . i drink coffee because i like the flavor . this was my second tasting of via . i tried it when it was first released in 2009 and was hoping to see an improvement but my notes from that tasting are very similar . i really think that a high end instant is a good idea , but unfortunately for me , via misses the mark . for a quick and relatively convenient cup , i would suggest investing $ 30 in an " aeropress " made by aerobie and widely available . armed with a freshly roasted coffee from your local micro roaster , you get a tasty , easy to prepare cup , and a very simple cleanup . . * we use the descriptive term " acidity " to describe brightness . this is not to be confused with the often heard term " acidic " which people lament about a coffee that upsets their stomachs . this is thought of by many people in the industry to be the result contamination of chemical fertilizers , pesticides , molds , fungus , and other contaminants often found in non - specialty grade coffee . we believe that most of these complaints would disappear simply by trying a better quality coffee . * * fresh = less than two weeks from roasting . most coffee is way beyond this timeline . . . .

no hexane solvents please remember that dha / ara added to infant formulas ( both non - organic and organic ) are extracted using petroleum - derived hexane solvents . one of the reasons i choose organic is to avoid hexane solvents ; hexane is a very efficient extraction procedure ( check wikipedia or google ) , but not organic . do a little research on what is in the dha added to infant formulas before you buy . it will be educational . also , as organic consumers , we breast fed whenever possible . formula is only used for supplementation . breast milk provides ample amount of dha & ara and all the other essential fatty acids . so getting more from an organic formula is just a waste of money .

my cats won't touch it i bought the reduced calorie food because my cats are inside all day long and are getting quite fat . they won't touch this stuff . they love the indoor variety but not the reduced calorie . overall i've been very happy with natural balance and the cats seem to devour the indoor but not the reduced . so now i have to mix the reduced with the indoor . they still seem to pick at the indoor and leave the reduced calorie in their bowls . man , cats can be so picky .

be careful ! some of these prunes do contain pits ! these prunes arrived well - packaged , double - sealed and fresh and moist . however , in one of the canisters i probably came across a half dozen prunes still containing a sharp pit or pieces of pit . i almost broke my tooth on one of the pits because i bit down on the prune and wasn't expecting something so hard . i would not give these prunes to children or to elderly people who may have fragile teeth . it is a good deal , so one option would be to carefully inspect and cut up the prunes into small pieces - - looking for the pits - - before giving to children or elderly .

pass the test ! these are everything they say , i have a malamute that annihilates bones within minutes . rawhide was not even in our consideration , he could rip it off in seconds and choke on sharp pieces . however , the choices out there are slim and i began my research again . after reading the reviews here i decided to risk it . this is really wrapped tight and he's been chewing on it for days , safely i might add , the rawhide is very thick before they even tightly roll it .

product listing incorrect - actually box of 24 bags when i placed this order i had a hard time getting information about this product from amazon . the listing is faulty , it looks like you are paying about $ 19 for one 1 . 8oz bag , especially since it indicates you are paying $ 10 . 46 / oz . i knew this had to be incorrect , so before placing the order , i contacted amazon who indicated there was a listing error but they thought this listing for actually supposed to be for 12 bags . i thought this didn't make sense either since the theater sized boxes , 3 . 1oz each , was only $ 10 . 52 for 12 boxes . this listing would cost almost double for far less product . i suspected that this was actually a box of 24 bags since the regular sour patch kids in the 1 . 8 oz size were listed as a box of 24 . i took a chance and ordered this and i am happy to report that it is , in fact , a box of 24 individual bags . i just wanted to share this information to help the next person who stumbles upon the listing . the gummis themselves are actually quite good .

spoiling my cat when my primary grocery store began charging 72 cent a can for fancy feast , i looked elsewhere and was thrilled to find that amazon . com had exactly what i wanted for 58 cents a can . i use two cases a month and being that i am disabled , and i no longer drive , having the two cases delivered to my door for no extra cost was a double treat . i went to order next months supply a few days ago and in one fell swoop the price has jumped up to the same as my grocery store . i will no longer purchase my fancy feast from amazon . com . the brand fancy feast is a perfect serving size and seems to be of a good quality even though i have never taken a bite . it was nice while it lasted .

this used to be a great product , used to be i used to buy this at costco when i used to live near one . after moving , i had a lot of difficulty finding canned wild salmon that is boneless , skinless , tastes descent , and won't break your wallet ( i eat salmon every day ) . i lead a very busy schedule , so i don't always have time to prepare meals from scratch , but want to stay healthy , so i look for products such as this salmon in a can . i gave up on finding bpa free cans a long time ago , so i don't bother checking for that anymore , and couldn't tell you if these cans are bpa free or not . with all that said , i was excited to find this product on amazon , as i used to eat this brand all the time . i ordered it , and opened a can expecting the same great taste . i was soooooo disappointed ! they must have changed the recipe or something , because now it tastes like one of those cheap brands where you're not even sure it's real salmon . it's no better in flavor than the stuff that i do find on the grocery store cans , which are all real gross in flavor . i gave it two stars because the flavor is

low acid high quality im not much of a starbucks fan and most of their coffee turms my stomach in knots but not so with sumatra ! this is a low acid coffee of high quality and at a very competitive price . coffee used to give me all sorts of gastric / reflux problems but coffees such as this . . . and $ $ $ peaberry $ $ $ allow me to drink coffee again !

c'mon its reeses pieces ! ! ! ! this is candy , if your reading this youve probably already eaten reeses pieces , you know what they taste like , and if you buy this bag you must be a really big fan of them like i am , ive still got half a bag and i bought them in february / march . soooo goooooood ! ! but unless your going to use them for baking or just eat candy constantly , i wouldnt recommend this big of a bag for a single human consumption . big families should use this bag

yummy ! this is amazing syrup . you have to watch the price though . it fluctuates on amazon quite a bit . i bought this when it as offered on a buy one get one free deal . two bottles for $ 26 ! better deal than i can find locally . works great on waffles , pancakes and in baking . original review 11 / 2009 . update 9 / 2012i have this item on subscribe . it is listed as unavailable . however , it is for sale for a * new * subscription at a savings of only 5 % instead of the 15 % i have waiting on my list page . come on amazon ! do you think we would not notice the price change ? watch what you pay since the subscribes are changing so much . plus , even if i asked for it now , the policy is not to ship until my assigned date next month anyway . for now , i am going with another product and wait to see if they actually send me a jug of this or just cancel my current subscription to force me to change to the more expensive offer .

taste of course , they can't really help how these taste , but i didn't much like it . maybe they're not ripened all the way ? i don't know . but i know they're supposed to be good for me !

i disagree with the other reviewers i'm a huge fan of seedlanderdoctor kracker seedlander organic crispbreads , 7 - ounce boxes ( pack of 6 ) . i go through a shipment of those every month . i wanted to try something else , and listened to the reviews . first of all , i'm not exactly sure what rosemary tastes like , but i have tried rosemary flatbread before and loved it . this cracker either has too much rosemary , or maybe something else i'm not aware of . just my opinion on the taste . i really am going to give the unopened boxes to charity ( a person who is hungry ) . i will keep these in my car because i know somebody less fortunate than me will really appreciate these . hopefully , they like it as well as the other reviewers . peace

this wild alaskan salmon is right off the hook good . . . if you are a fan of specialty smoked salmon or prefer to select your fish at a seafood counter you may not care for bear & wolf . this is almost right off the hook good . it has that " fishy " taste that i actually prefer , but if you serve this up to those who don't care for it you'll be getting a thumbs down . if you've tried the kirkland brand , which is delightfully pink and flaky , you might be taken aback when you see and taste something from the wild . i do not like most canned salmon because it is farmed . . . some farming conditions are less than optimal ( such a turn off ) . this is wild alaskan salmon that crumbles when you take a fork to it . on the label it says , " satisfaction guaranteed or your money refunded .

it's a sugar bomb i bought the cranberry almond and the pomegranate blueberry pistachio . i'm not sure how anyone can comment on the flavor - it's sooooo sweet . the non gmo glucose + the sugar + the honey masks any flavor this bar might have . it's my fault . i should have read more closely . not sure i understand how this is a " low glycemic " food . definitely not a kind option if you're trying to reduce your overall sugar consumption .

here are some hints to help you transition or make the best out of pellet training your dog . i can't really complain about a system that gives me peace of mind when i'm not at home . my dog is 10 lbs and 11 - months old . i wouldn't recommend this product if you have a dog that's more than 30 pounds . i would say a miniature spaniel or small cockerspaniel would be the top sized dog you'd want to use a litter box with . but then again , if you have a large space like a connecting garage or a very large kitchen area and have space for an extra large tray , it could probably work too . although i don't use my litter box outdoors , i can see this as a useful potty aid if you don't want your dog to mess up your outside garden area . i'm thinking about adding a box outside because i don't have a lawn , and it's mostly concrete and dirt . my dog still enjoys his walks , and does go poop and pee outside in the park lawn whenever i take him . he also goes inside his litter box , but it's not as preferable for him . he will still pee on my carpet when he's roaming around and not near the litter box . so my dog , even at 11 months old is not completely housebroken . he's not a very smart dog , so i don't think he ever will be housebroken . if you have a dog like mine , this might be your best solution . if i know that he has just eaten or drank a lot of water , i bring him back to the litter box after a couple of hours ( which is in my laundry room ) and close the door for a while or wait until he goes . this is the only way to make sure he doesn't have accidents . if your dog is paper trained or pad trained , you should follow the " transition " instructions on the purina website . my dog has only used the litter box since birth , but when he discovered the lawn , he never quite liked the litter box as much . so here is the best way to use this litter . 1 . only line the bottom of the tray with a small layer , just enough to cover the bottom . this will save you a lot of litter and cash in your pocket . the instructions wants you to put in at least an inch of pellets . i found it very wasteful and heavy to pick up and clean as well . 2 . the second most important reason why you want just a thin layer is because it's always best to replace your litter often . this makes for less waste . 3 . when your dog pees on the pellets , they swell up and you can tell which pellets have been soaked . if you're careful , you can use a small scooper to clean that portion out and replace it with fresh pellets . 4 . also clean up poop out of the litter box on a daily basis or as soon as your dog poops . this will prevent a smelly room , and encourage your dog to go back in the litter box . my dog barks when there's poop in the box and tells me to clean it when he's in his room at night . ( he literally drags me out of bed with his barking ! ) i just use some toilet paper to pick it up , and flush the poop down the toilet . this saves on biodegradable poop bags and again , puts a little cash back in your pocket . 5 . if you bought the petco blue litter box tray , there's some tricky placement to consider due to the foot ledge that sticks out . do read my review on the petco blue litter box tray or remember these tips : a . never put the box flush against the wall . this won't allow your dog ample space to roam around the litter box before it actually pees or poops . this will limit the number of accidents outside of the box . also , if you have a male dog with a marking problem , you will see lots of urine on the floor next to the wall . b . face the foot ledge toward the wall , ( if your room is narrow and long like a laundry room . . . this is where we put our tray ) and leave some space between the foot ledge and the wall for your dog to walk around . c . be prepared to sop up pee on the foot ledge . this will be a common place for your dog to have a pee or poop accident . still . . . better on the ledge than on the floor . the blue raised circles on the foot ledge makes it difficult to clean urine . i have to fold up my paper towels and sop around the circles . d . always use a doggie cleaner on the foot ledge after you clean up an accident on the foot ledge . your room will start to smell if you don't . e . if you don't want to struggle with this seemingly difficult foot ledge , try the actual purina tray . i think the trick is to have a high edge around the tray , so the dog is not tempted to be partially outside the tray when it is going pee or poop . f . wash your tray every week or at least every two weeks . no matter how often you empty your pellets , the smell still gets on the tray itself . there just isn't a perfect sanitary system . i guess not having a dog is the perfect sanitary system ! : - ) 6 . pellet bags are heavy . . . especially the 25 pound bag . i bought a plastic bowl to help me scoop the pellets out and control the amount that goes in the tray . no one wants to scoop the pellets back into the bag from a dirty tray after the fact . get the scooper . . . it will actually save you money by controlling the amount of pellets that go into the tray , and your back in the long run . 7 . to avoid your dog from chewing on the pellets , especially in the wee morning hours when it starts to get hungry , leave some treats around his room a night . be prepared to sweep up pellets on occasion . a bored and hungry dog , makes for a naughty dog . 8 . if you are transitioning your dog , make sure you put some of his urine soaked pads or newspapers inside the box so he can smell it in the early stages . your dog should adjust in about a week or two . good luck !

please read before purchasing ! ! ! dogs are omnivores , meaning they can survive on a vegetarian diet , but by no means will they thrive without the inclusion of animal proteins . if you are genuinely concerned about the moral implications of a dog's diet and choose to feed this to your dogs , i would strongly suggest supplementing this food with free range eggs , sustainably harvested sardines , or some other source of animal protein that you deem morally acceptable . i have vegetarian friends who feed their dogs this and other formulas , and when compared to my lab , who is fed a high - protein , grain - free dog food , they almost look abused . literally , they are all very slim and their fur is coarse and patchy , as opposed to my dog , who is muscular , with fur is as soft as cotton , and as happy as can be . if you want an all - inclusive dog food that will handle your dog's nutritional needs , this is not the dog food for you . that said , if your morals won't allow you to use a dog food with named meat products as the top ingredients ( and there are organic varieties ) , then this may be a good option for you . please , just remember to supplement with some form of animal protein every time you feed .

tastes great but is unhealthy and expensive it is pricey and has high fructose corn syrup in it . i dont see why they dont make it more natural , is it really difficult to make it hfc free ?

gelatinous and an odd sweet flavor i understand that opinions vary greatly in these things , but i cannot for the life of me see how so many people like the sweet baby ray's sauces . i tried the original recipe and this . the original was very ho hum but i thought this one was kind of gross . the taste is slightly fake , as if its not made with sugar or honey but with some sort of chemical . the texture is a bit gelatinous which contributes to the feeling of this being a synthetic product . it reminds me of american cheese . its not awful , and on the right application actually tastes good , but it isn't really cheese and eating it makes me feel kind of yucky . i have since moved on and tried a few other sauces commonly found in grocery stores . the one i landed on is " cattlemen's award winning kansas city classic barbecue sauce " . so good you could just drink it . try that one out .

still scratching my head . . . a few months ago , i bought a bottle of this amazing olive oil at my local whole foods store . my partner and i loved it ! put it on everything ! thought we'd die without it ! and then , of course , we went to replace it and couldn't find it in stock . no problem , we thought . amazon . com has never failed us . we found it quickly , ordered it , it came early , wrapped securely - - everything was perfect , as usual . but then something looked different . the bottle was the same size and color , but the oil was darker . and we noticed that the bottle from whole foods had a seal of approval from the north american olive oil association ( of all things ! ) and the one from the web did not . the flavor of the whole foods' bottle was zippier , too . since the north american olive oil association started certifying us oils fairly recently , and because the darker , uncertified oil was a bit flat , i can only assume that the darker , flatter uncertified oil was perhaps from a prior year's harvest ( several hours of searching the web for answers turned up nothing ) . so for me , when it comes to iliada kalamata golden selection extra virgin olive oil , i'm going to make sure it has that seal . next year , when perhaps all olive oils will come with the seal , maybe we should start making them date their bottles ? 
=================
contains fructose and torbinado sugar not sure how this can fall into the low carb camp when it's got crystalline fructose and torbinado sugar in the ingredients . i guess i don't consider 6 net grams of sugars to be low carb . . . but you may think otherwise . we all have different limits . i know , some claim that torbinado sugar is " better " for you because it's less processed , but that's like saying gin is better for your liver than everclear because it's distilled less . both have a serious impact on your liver . likewise , sugar and torbinado sugar have a serious impact on your body over time . sure , this tastes pretty darned good compared to other low carb brands , but in my opinion , that's because it's got more tasty sugar . the impact on my insulin after eating this is significant enough that i can't have it . just beware of that . lastly , i wish more food vendors would pay attention to sugars and wheats . there's getting to be a growing body of evidence that sugars ( fructose especially ) and wheat products are what's leading western countries into obesity and cancer . you can check out eatingacademy dotcom for the science behind it .

another error , wake up ! here's another 4 . 4lb bag of dog food that does not represent the normal " regular " price . at that standard per pound price , you could be buying the juiciest prime filet mignon and get to watch man's best friend become even a better best friend ! wake up amazon !

filter collapses the coffee is good here but the filter in the cup collapses causing the cup to fill with grounds . al least 50 % of the cups in the box had this problem .

old time taste reminds be of when i was a boy at my grand parents farm where they did there own meat . store meats just don't have that old time flavor .

acai berry 100 % pure organic juice after a week now of drinking the 2 oz in the morning and chasing it with orange juice , i think i've identified what that awful taste is like ! it's like drinking kalamata olive juice . i love kalamata olives but not to drink its juice straight ! 
=================
chia seed i read all of the good stuff associated with chia seed . my husband and i have been determined to eat healthier , and go organic when possible . we are succeeding in our endeavors , and thought that this product would fit right into our new lifestyle . i have attempted to get this seed into things that we eat regularly . it just does not work for me . i cannot get past the slime and mouth feel . for those of you who are able to , i think that is wonderful , but i am going to pass on any further use of it .

they changed the recipe ! i bought a box of this tea a few months ago , and it was amazing , best earl grey i have ever had . i decided to order a package of 6 boxes , and the tea i got was completely different . different packaging , different baggies , shorter string , and most importantly of all terrible tea . i cannot even drink it , it is so bad . it doesn't even taste like earl grey , but cheap lipton tea . there are no words to explain my utter disappointment . i would give it zero stars , if i could . update . . . i called two leaves and a bud to ask why this tea was so different , and they admitted that they have changed not only their tea source , but also their production / packaging facility . so the new tea is indeed a completely different product ( these changes span all packaging types : single boxes , bags , 100 count , and 6 - box count ) . their customer service however , is superb . they offered to replace the 6 boxes with any of their other products . i chose loose - leaf decaf earl grey ( which is almost as delicious as the pre - change earl grey ) . i didn't even need to ship the 6 boxes back - they told me to keep it , give it away , whatever . what an outstanding company !

price double supermarket's smuckers apricot preserves is a good product . my objection is this vendor's pricing per unit . it is more than double supermarket price per unit of $ 3 . 99 .

good concept , but too large this was a gift from a friend that used and liked it . i , however , found the spoon part of this too large ( too deep ) for my daughter . now that she's older , it might work , but we feed her thicker foods , and i don't know that they'd squeeze through the dispenser well . i also found it awkward to hold . 
=================
why the malic acid ? i really wanted to love these . i waited so long to try them because of all the thinkfruit varieties , this is the most expensive one . while most of the thinkfruit varieties only have sugar , maybe a little oil , and / or " natural flavors " added , this blueberry variety has malic acid added . i don't know if this is causing the problem for me but the blueberries tasted " off " to me . nothing like a dried blueberry . i looked it up and ( simplified ) , malic acid provides a tart flavor and that's not what i'm tasting . i'm not tasting blueberry either . the only reason i'm not giving this one star is because i can stand them if i rinse them or soak them in something before using them for baking or consuming . once rinsed and soaked , they taste much better , regardless of what i had to soak them in . ( water , juice , amaretto ) the best variety of all of the thinkfruit flavors is the thinkfruit whole cranberries , 1 . 5 ounce bags ( pack of 10 ) in my opinion . they taste just like what you'd expect a dried cranberry to taste like . 
=================
decent at best this jerky is close , but not quite as good as good as other pre - packaged bags you can get at the gas station . it's tender and substantial , so points there . the flavor though is mediocre at best ; poor would be a fair description . also , if you open the bag it will grow mold in a few days . maybe this is a problem with other brands of jerky too . i wouldn't know because this is the first time i have opened a bag and not eaten it relatively quickly ( see above's flavor comments ) . all in all , this isn't very good jerky . 
=================
honesty is the best policy . . . ? not very happy with this one , which really doesn't happen very often for me , since i'm forgiving . put my faith in an item too soon since there was only one review that was positive when i ordered . however , after receiving my order , i'm finding more and more reviews pop up of how the item was not delivered as presented . i agree , and that's why i checked back . i mean , i understand when the picture isn't the same , but a deceptive product description ? c'mon ! first off , i'm unsatisfied because i received my product broken up and smashed around in the box with all the brown confetti , rendering it ungiftable without effort . if i wanted to exert effort , i would have gone to the store and gathered things myself & fashioned them into a basket . they did , however , provide me with a " delidirect " catalogue , coupon , and random green tortes i didn't order ( perhaps added as an apology ) . . . . secondly , i really ordered this for the cheese , for a cheese lover . but the cheeses do not come in 4oz blocks as advertised ( instead 2oz x 2ea flavor ) , and they are all processed cheese food . not cool . this means we get to eat it instead . . did a taste test , it's all plastic same - flavor stuff , but higher quality than velveeta , if that's a consolation . i will make note of anytime i see the word " flavor " when ordering cheese in the future . since i saw " wisconsin " advertised everywhere , i expected the real deal , even if " sub par " but not processed . . . this brings me to the third strike , the meat products were not the flavors they said were included - garlic , mesquite , & original . instead , it was 1 salami , and 2 original summer sausages , one just in the plastic , and one in the plastic as well as a special paper sack ? ! was this to trick me into thinking it was a different flavor ? overall , three strikes you're out delidirect ( ahem , amazon ) , i hate dealing with complications in mail order stuff , this is lame & means my family " wins " the prize . > main reason i'm posting . . . . be honest with descriptions . i'm sure all of us consumers would appreciate it .

why all the positive reviews ? - - udated . i love it ! this tea is super sour . . . . taste like lemons . it tastes nothing like tea and i don't taste any raspberries . very disappointed . raspberry gardens is so much better . update : oh how wrong i was . i thought this tea was disgusting and put it in the back of my cupboard to never try again . thankfully i tried it again today and made it into an iced tea and sweetened it . it's now my favorite tea . now i know where all the positive reviews are coming from .

good product , terrible price ! my five year old loves this milk and the fact that it is shelf stable means that i can pack it in his school snacks and not worry about it spoiling . . . very handy . but , amazon's price is horrible . what a way to take advantage of people who might live in remote areas without a retail outlet . i buy this at bj's for $ 12 . 79 for a case of 18 and can even get it at whole foods ( you know , of the " whole paycheck " joke ) for $ 14 . 99 . they do have the strawberry milk here , which i've never seen at a retail store , but , fortunately , my son doesn't like it . i did buy it on " sale " for closer to the usual retail price . 
=================
image revamped , title still wront the image provided for this item looks really good , doesn't it ? well , forget about it because if you order you will receive something completely different . what you get is a microwavable " bowl " of salty tomato soup with 6 tortellini in it . the product title says nothing about soup , and certainly the image is not soup , but that's what arrives , so be warned . funny thing : if you go to healthy choice website and enter " healthy choice all natural cheese tortellini , " you get the same image offered here . makes me wonder if there really is such a product ( and it might be very good ) . maybe you only get this awful substitute when you order from amazonupdate . amazon corrected the image but the incorrect item title remains . there is , in fact , a product by healthy choice called " healthy choice all natural cheese tortellini " and it is a 14oz meal of tortellini and vegetables . the image matched to this title , and the item you will receive if you order , is tortellini soup and a really poor one because it is just weak tomato soup with only six , yes only 6 tortellini . this is a great example of amazon's increasingly ineffectual management of their site .

could be orangier tried this since my usual brand from the coop was so expensive ( $ 10 + ) for the same size . ( make biscotti w / orange & pecan ) first batch was not as " orangie " as i had remembered . the 2nd batch was much better . perhaps exposing the fruit to air gave it more flavor . this s a good ingredient given the price difference between this & my usual brand . 
=================
what a mixture of reviews ! i guess our taste buds are all completely different considering the mixed reviews on this product . myself , i thought the stevia in the raw was pretty good . it was no better or worse than any other sweetner i have tasted . considering it is healthier than the others , i will make it my brand of choice . for one reviewer to call anyone who claims they like stevia in the raw a liar , that is absurd . some people are so mean . many people drink diet coke and i can't stand it , even after trying to like it for years . we all have different taste buds , obviously . that is not a lie !

one spoiled can spoils the batch initially my cats loved all three flavors of this fancy feast product . then i got a box that had one badly deformed and bulging can ; obviously bacteria were growing in it . i didn't even open it - just threw it away . i called the company to inform them . they asked for the production number from the can and sent me coupons for 4 free cans . wonderful , as far as it goes , but that entire batch must have been bad because the cats would not touch any of the chicken - flavored cans remaining in the box . so i'm out eight cans , not just the four replaced . these things happen , but i can't afford to throw away money like that , so if it happens again , i will not be buying fancy feast . in the meantime , the cats love the beef first , and turkey comes in a close second .

americolor is good but vendor is questionable i've purchased many different americolor gel colors and am happy with them when they are fresh . i purchased 7 bottles from this tcp vendor and 5 of them were old , one even had a use by date of one year before my order ! working with tcp to get a refund has not been as pleasant as working directly with amazon . i finally did get a refund but only for the product , not the shipping charges . the products were old and unusable . i am very disappointed with this vendor and will purchase my colorants from another more reliable source . americolor is good tcp is not . the two yellows i ordered from tcp were good and fresh and the student pack that shipped directly from amazon was good and fresh . i'm happy with these colors but will not order again from tcp because of the other 5 old colors .

=================
no more postum withdrawal ! maybe it's been too long since i've been able to drink postum or maybe my taste buds are dull , but i honestly can't tell the difference in taste between dandy blend and postum . the only difference i've noticed is that dandy blend is a finer powder which means it actually dissolves better in water than postum . if an announcement were to be made tomorrow that postum is coming back , i think i'd stick with the dandy blend ! 
=================
great rice biscuits , but be aware of expiration date ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! my 12 month old loves these biscuits as a treat , they're very similar in texture to the baby mum - mums . very little mess with these also . however please be aware that amazon will not resolve the issue if the biscuits are close to the expiration date on the box . my order arrived nov 4th and the biscuits expire on 6th feb next year . not likely that i'll be giving my son more than one of these per day , so biscuits will go to waste . amazon will not accept returns , refund , partial refund , or replace the product . they will do nothing . i asked if this would be the case if the expiration was one month after receiving them and the consultant said " yes " ! sucky policy you have there , amazon . i'll be buying these elsewhere in future .

stays a bit too crunchy tastes great , has lots of fiber , lots of protein , and stays crunchy all the way through the bowl . but , it stays a bit too crunchy . this morning , i found a marble - sized , tightly - packed , super - hard piece of " crunch " in my bowl and removed it right away . unfortunately , my next spoonful had more of this hard cereal in it . and , when i tried to chew it , my tooth broke in half . ouch ! sorry , but no cereal should break your tooth , ever ! it's very unfortunate because i ate a bowl of this every day , it's good for me , and i actually liked it . but , i need my teeth for a few more years . eat at your own risk !

false advertising for some strange reason you and college inn have been leading customers to believe that the product thai coconut curry would be available for purchase . it has been months and it has not shown up in stores or on amazon except as back - ordered . it would be reasonable for you to give some approximation as to when it mightm be available . some comment would be appreciated . long time customer , george chace

this used to be much better feline pine recently changed the formula to make it " 2x absorbent . " that also means it disintegrates twice as fast and now i have litter dust everywhere in my house . if you don't mind it in your bed , in the kitchen , on the furniture , and on your clothes , this litter is for you . it hides the odor better than any other litter - period . fyi , this is the second set of cats i'ved used feline pine with so i've been a customer for over 15 years . i just vacuumed yesterday and there's litter dust on my dresser , on the sofa and on the floor . i've bought my last bag of feline pine . what a shame .

made on shared equipment with other allergens . we bought these for my child who has anaphylaxis to nuts and dairy . we get the product home to find out there is a shared equipment warning . it says all preventative measures taken , etc . but if you're not comfortable giving your child shared equipment food you may want to know that up front . it would have been nice if they posted that part of the ingredient label on amazon .

nice alternative to regular soda it' an okay drink and didn't have a harsh or oddly synthetic taste to it as some " juice " drinks have , yet it wasn't anything super . this is a nice alternative to regular soda , but i don't see myself buying it that often . the high carbonation makes it less healthy than it is touted and is bad for your stomach . too bad they didn't make it less carbonated or perhaps a non - carbonated version .

bland this product is billed as an all natural anti - oxident and electrolyte replacing beverage . sort of like all - natural gatorade with anti - oxidents . like a sports beverage , it too is also kinda bland . i love some of the gatorade flavors , some not so much . this drink falls into the not so much category for me . it is sorta sweet , sorta pineapple - y , and also sorta bland . my wife commented that it has a slippery feel in her mouth , like the glass had soap in it still . i didn't think it was that bad but the drink really didn't appeal to me . in the end , yes , this drink is probably much better for you than a glass of apple juice and definitely better than some sugar infused punch . but as a sports drink , i think i'll stick with plain old gatorade ; it's cheaper and contains fewer calories per serving . if going the all natural route with your juices / drinks is of the utmost importance this may be something to consider and bump this review to 3 stars .

adams flea and tick dip this is not the same adams flea and tick dip of days gone by . the old formula was quite effective and got rid of ticks after 2 dippings on my dog maggie . my grandson's dog king is plagued with ticks because of the surrounding area that we live in . he's taken for walks along the street with woods and a lake and gets re - infested quite quickly . it has helped , but is not 100 % effective . now he scratches all the time and i have ordered some stop itch shampoo and conditioner to see if this helps . we even tried advantix that did not help get rid of the ticks either . we shall go back to the preventic collar . maybe a bubble suit or space suit would be the solution . " white american eskimo dog in a bubble / space suit walks the outer perimeter of miami florida along the lake and woods to keep out ticks " . we use advantage for fleas and he is flea free 100 % .

yummy these lollipops are so tasty ! i love that different flavors such as mango and pomegranate are included , and even the " standard " flavors like cherry and grape are better than regular ones . not to mention that they don't have anything artificial in them ! : ) these candies are pretty small . i believe 3 of them make one serving size , which is good because you can either eat another one if you want or just stick to one without feeling guilty about eating it ! also , the number of each flavor is roughly equal , but they aren't mixed up . when i opened mine , all the grapes were in the front , the cherry behind those , etc . i had to dump them all out to try apple d : but once i dumped them out they were mixed up : dall in all , i think these lollipops are worth a try . they taste good , come in new and different flavors ( like mango and pomegranate ) , and are completely natural ( even the color dyes ! ) . they definitely aren't worse than regular lollipops , so you might as well get these and save yourself from all the weird things that lollipops usually contain .

as expected i'm a novice when it comes to bonsai . i have purchased an elm and juniper and both arrived well packaged and healthy . actually , the packaging was a little tough because they were tightly wrapped with some kind of plastic wrap . and although i'm not an expert it's hard for me to testify that the juniper is actually 4 years old . to my amateur eyes it looks to be much younger . the elm has lost a few leaves yellowing and falling but after a few internet searches i learned why this is happening . the pots were as i expected and i believe them to be of nice quality . the box also had a green bottle of fertilizer which i wasn't expecting but it was nice and i appreciate it . i think it would have been better if the seller would have included a complementary brochure for bonsai related products such as humidity trays . the reason i say this is because i am a novice and upon initially ordering i had no clue that such things were needed to help bonsai thrive . at least with a complementary brochure i could have looked through it and say " hmm , what is a humidity tray for ? " and would have gotten around to getting a few sooner . i have had both bonsai for almost two weeks and neither appear to be dying or on the fringes of dying . and considering this is winter it's supposed to be the dormant season so i don't expect much activity until spring . i would buy again from this seller .

not for a smaller dog this gizmo is huge ! if it weren't so much trouble i'd send it back . looks like a great product for a st . bernard , but for my 13 - pound shih tzu it's overkill . there may be a smaller version , but i can only imagine what the hard plastic would sound like on my tile floors !

the failed my chihuahua taste test i have a rather picky chihuahua when it comes to dog food . she eats the generic brands reluctantly but at least finishes every bite . with this blue buffalo chicken and rice meal , she leaves the dark morsels alone . i once had to leave nothing but the dark morsels for a day for her to eat any and she only did it because she was so hungry . i like that the ingredients are healthy . however , it still means half of the bag is wasted with her avoiding the dark morsels whenever she can . one star deducted for me having wasted about half the bag because my dog is so picky .

delicious taste , but you pay a premium to substitute fructose for sucrose i eat this jam occasionally with peanut butter on crackers , and it is quite tasty . while it is less unhealthy than other sugary jams , i don't deceive myself that it won't raise blood sugar , because it is essentially 100 % fructose , which is just as capable of raising blood sugar as sucrose ( white / table sugar ) - - more on this below . most people buy this product as a presumed health food due to it being lower in sugar than other jams . it's ingredients are : " juice concentrate ( pear , grape ) , strawberries , maltodextrin ( dietary fiber ) , fruit pectin , citric acid , natural flavor . " this product contains no artificial sweeteners , which are associated with various health hazards . this product's primary claim to fame is that it is , as the label states , " sweetened only with fruit juice . " any jam will have its sweetener listed first , meaning that is its primary ingredient . if you are on a low - carb diet or diabetic , you might want to know that this jam basically substitutes fructose for sucrose . since fructose is twice as sweet as sucrose , the producers only need to use half as much as they would have of sucrose , so it has about half the calories of regular jam . ( on the other hand , many cheap jams contain high - fructose corn syrup - - but that's another health issue entirely . ) the problem for many people is that they are used to the taste of sucrose , and 100 % fructose tastes very different from a combination of fructose and sucrose which is the case with regular jam made with white sugar . to my own taste , since i'm eating a fruit spread , it tastes quite sweet enough to me . the fruit pectin in this product is a standard thickener in jellies and jams and its own natural form of fiber , so i am not sure why the company decided to add in maltodextrin and call that " fiber " too . anyone with a gluten intolerance should be wary of this product because of the maltodextrin since some people with gluten intolerance are getting sick from the maltodextrin in this jam . the producers claim on the label it is " gluten - free , " but maltodextrin can be made from either wheat or corn , and apparently this company is not being careful enough about contamination with gluten . another ingredient that is problematic as to how healthy this product can be is the " natural flavor . " it is possible that the producers add a strawberry extract so they can get away with using less real strawberries , which are more expensive than a flavoring . the definition of natural flavor under the code of federal regulations is : " the essential oil , oleoresin , essence or extractive , protein hydrolysate , distillate , or any product of roasting , heating or enzymolysis , which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice , fruit or fruit juice , vegetable or vegetable juice , edible yeast , herb , bark , bud , root , leaf or similar plant material , meat , seafood , poultry , eggs , dairy products , or fermentation products thereof , whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional " ( 21cfr101 . 22 ) . that essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food , but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is .

really hard to get down . i had seen these on a tv show , they ate them on the show and made them seem pretty tasty . i wont buy again , they are like eating sawdust ! i had to drink so much water to get them down . i did find that if you put cream cheese on them its a lot better but i would rather eat my fiber bars , even my daughter likes those .

oh my god people must be fool to buy this when you can get the same thing at the asian market , chinese food stores or indian stores for only one dollar , are they seller the jar or the tamarin . be careful .

works but does not taste very good this coffee has a decent amount of caffeine , but it's difficult even for me to drink , and i drink black coffee every day . this stuff reminds me of the icky folgers stuff i drank every day in high school before i realized that coffee could taste good . maybe it's just this flavor and not the brand , so i may consider trying another flavor in the future , though i'll probably keep trying out other brands a bit more before trying eight o'clock again .

doesnt work for medium size insects - they just walk right thru it i seem to have develop a new roach problem recently , so got this based on the " fantastic " reviews and price . it seems to have only caught small bugs like silver fish or 1 / 4 inch spiders . one day i saw a spider crawling around ; i put the box in front of it and it didnt go in at first and turned around . then i moved the box again in its path and it ran right through it ! so much for a trap . . . its more like a walk in a park with some sticky puddle of goob for these critters . i had good luck with using roach motel a long time ago . will try it again .

poor amazon pricing while i like this coffee in the same way that many other reviewers have already articulated , amazon's usual top pricing is way off . not only has the availability been poor , but i'm buying this package for less than $ 10 . 00 from one of the many coffee pod / disc internet providers . amazon almost always has the best ( lowest ) pricing ! what is wrong in this category ?

inferior quality caused by pgpr unwrapping an egg it appears to be very slippery . when eating an egg i can taste the peanut butter and the supposed chocolate coating taste very oily with only a slight hint of cocoa . after eating an egg it leaves my mouth with an oily feeling . whether this candy really causes it or not i don't know but after eating several i later had lots of burps . from now on , i will avoid any candy which contains this pgpr simply because of the oily texture and lack of taste of real chocolate . wikipedia says : it is used by chocolate makers to reduce the cost of raw material . since 2006 , commercial - grade candy bars , such as those made by hersheys and nestle , made an industry - wide switch to include pgpr as an ingredient - a possible indicator of a cost - saving measure by the commercial chocolate industry . makers of pgpr such as danisco and palsgaard indicate pgpr can be used to replace the more expensive cocoa butter as an ingredient in chocolate . palsgaard's website asserts , " cocoa butter is an expensive raw material for chocolate manufacturers . by using palsgaard 4150 the chocolate recipe has lower costs in terms of less cocoa butter but also gives the benefit of having less fat . " " less fat " . guess i'm one who like fat better than an oily substitute . ingredients such as pgpr should be shown for consumable items imho .

post - consumer waste . . . in my quest to find new and exciting cereals for my morning wakeup , i stumbled across a mega - box of waffle crisp at the grocery store yesterday and just had to snatch it up . i love waffles ( who doesn't ) and so i just had to try this . what starts off rather delicious turns to mush very quickly , so if you tend to take your time eating your breakfast ( which is the case with me since i work from home and eat while i work ) then this can turn off - putting rather quickly . the maple flavor ( which is the best part of the waffle experience ) is subtle enough to not be overly sweet , but it is also subtle enough to be mistaken for something else entirely . in fact , this tasted a lot like cookie crisp at first , which is not what i was wanting . my milk was rather delicious in the end , so there is always that . i can't say that i'm all that impressed really . i wanted to be , and i expected to be , but at the end of the day ( or should i say ` morning' ) i'm left with some mushy mini - sponges swimming in lightly flavored maple milk .

product is fine , but my order was damaged . my flour was wet with another product i bought had opened and spilled on the flour . i salvaged most of the flour but could not contact amazon about my problem , i tried to follow their procedure but was not sucessful . these products are not cheap . so i'm not sure about another order through amazon .

tastes good but some ingredients questionable this product does taste good , and it only contains 5 calories from 1 gram of sugar . it takes 2 or 3 minutes to completely dissolve , but that's not a problem . what is confusing / questionable are some of the ingredients . among others listed are " sucralose ( sweetner ) , maltodextrin ( corn ) , . . . isomalt " . what are these things ? two of them appear to be malt products and the other an artificial sweetner . is this maltodextrin ( corn ) similar to high fructose corn syrup ? also , at the very bottom of the " nutrition facts " , apart from the ingredients list , 10 mg of caffeine per 8 fl oz serving ( 2 servings / packet " is also mentioned . when only 1 / 2 packet ( one serving per the package ) is added to 8 fluid ounces of water , the taste is definitely watered down .

true herbs by anyone's standards . herbs de provence in crockery are the " real deal " . a delight of flavours that just cannot locate seperate & " throw together " ! these have rosemary & fragrance of lilacs . no other company does this and never will . we sprinkle the montage over everything . all flavours meld nicely & quite literally are difficult to find . oregano or marjoram { wild oregano } , thyme and the aforementioned rosemary & petals of edible lilacs . before you cringe , try . poultry shines as does " beouf " & other proteins or vegetables . had missed this for a few years ~ not again . in a cool , dry place w / lid intact will last a year . { remember , herbs have to grow in their seasons too . } amazon is commended for being a supplier as their partners as well . always check here first & save your money . i did not & know better next year . . .

your kidding right ? great product ! i used to order this for about $ 53 . 00 and some change . but in the last couple of weeks it has been raised to $ 80 . 00 ? ! ? ! seriously ? ? ? ? this is why i give it one star . will most definitely be switching .

go get the real thing i'm really pleased that korean food is beginning to ebb into the mainstream , but anyone who's interested in cooking korean food should still make the trip down to their local korean market and buy the genuine article . annie chun has altered the taste profile of gochujang significantly , as well as consistency . it has the consistency of sauce that's already mixed with sesame oil , but not the richness , and it's far too sweet . the spicy is not full bodied , but flat , and there's a slightly weird aftertaste in the bibimbap i made with this sauce . i've never had any of these problems with gochujang from any of the major korean brands ( all you'll find in the vast majority of korean / asian markets ) . ugh .

difficult to apply and ineffective for squirrels ! the product label says to apply at the rate of 1 lb . per 40 square feet . impossible to measure the rate of application and when using the narrowest opening on the spout the 5 lbs . were gone in about 50 square feet ( ? ? ? ) . if it had some color to it you could a least see where you've been with it but as it is it blends in with the grass so well you can't tell . i used it to circle my peach trees to keep the varmints away and so far it appears to be helping but it will be very expensive to have to reapply every rain . i think i will look for a cheaper alternative or i will have the most expensive peaches in the country . this is a follow up to my review . it has been about 4 days since i sprinkled the product around the base of the peach trees . it has not rained but today i was watching the squirrels running through the " protected " area without even noticing it as they continued stealing my peaches . so much for that idea !

caveat i must say up front i have not tried these noodles . i ordered them and , when they arrived , i opened the box to find bags of white , squigly things suspended in a clear fluid ( water ) . it looked like something i would order from an elementary science teacher's supply catalog . so i set it on my counter and spent a week trying to get past the way they look . i visited the web site again . i read the - good - reviews . but the bottom line , for me , is that they look repulsive . on day 7 , they went into the trash . i have a similar issue with barilla plus . i think they taste fine , but they look very unappetizing to me after they are cooked . if you are trying to find a good noodle ( pasta ) alternative , try dreamfields . it's real pasta ; it tastes like real pasta ; it looks like pasta ; it's good quality pasta . but it has a higher fiber content , which makes it more filling and lowers the glycemic index . you'll never know you're not eating regular old pasta .

beware ! ! made my dog sick ! ! ! i am writing this review to warn other dog owners of blue buffalo for dogs and what it has done to my 5 yr . old miniature dachshund named " calla " . back in late october 2011 i switched to blue buffalo after it was recommended by a family member . by mid - november calla started to cry out at night . we thought it might be a back issue and our " three " yes three vets agreed that it could be intervertebral disc disease . we had blood work done in november and everything looked fine with the exceptions that she was a " little " dehydrated . after months of treatments , with little to no improvement we thought it might be a stomach issue and i started to think about the timing of the change to blue buffalo , then i went and goggled " consumer complaints about blue buffalo pet foods " and started to really connect the dots . yesterday she was diagnosed with " pancreatitis " and needs to be in the hospital for days for treatment . i have spent over 3k to this point and do not know if calla will ever recover fully from this . she was a completely healthy dog before we changed to blue buffalo and since have been living in hell with nighty episodes . please read up on this issues people are having with this product before you buy . i wish i could give a product - minus 5 stars ! ! ! !

good quality , good taste , price could be better the pacific gold jerky is much better in terms of taste and quality than the cheaper bulk packages available on amazon and elsewhere . the cheaper brands make heavy use of msg , preservatives , and spices . the result is like having a chewy , spicy , chemistry lab in your mouth . pacific gold tries to balance cost and quality and does a pretty good job of it . the packages i bought state that the jerky is made of beef that comes from one or more of five countries : u . s . , canada , australia , new zealand , and uruguay . the pacific gold label says there is no " added " msg , but it does not say there is no msg . the pacific gold flavor is credible - - you can taste beef ( and like it ) as well as brown sugar and hickory flavoring and there is no distracting chemical taste . the only product i have found so far on amazon that is in a similar quality / price bracket is golden valley's non - organic line . golden valley is a little less expensive than pacific gold , especially if you subscribe . the last time i read golden valley's package it stated that the jerky was made of u . s . beef raised without hormones . golden valley recently raised the price of the product i like substantially , but even after the price increase it is competive in its quality bracket .

amazon's proce is double than in grocery store i discoved this drink two weeks ago at a truck stop on my return home from virginia . a cool can from their refrigerated diaplay cost $ 2 . 49 . i liked the flavor and kick from the starbucks doubleshot energy plus coffee drink and the starbucks doubleshot energy plus mocha & vanilla flavors , also $ 2 . 49 a can . i couldn't find either type in the local grocery store , so i automatically began my amazon . com order then , right before i checked out , read the customer reviews from the other amazon sites about the high price amazon was charging $ 79 . 95 for a 12 pack of the starbucks doubleshop energy plus drink as well as $ 59 . 95 . i checked with my local walmart grocery store , and bought both kinds for $ 2 . 50 a 15 oz can which comes to only $ 30 . 00 for 12 cans . i am very disappointed that amazon . com is charging in excess for this product and will definitely do some comparative price shopping in the future before i automatically shop at amazon . com .

best ever treats these freeze - dried liver treats from pooch passions are the best ever . my little shih tzu and lhaso apso love the flavor and texture . they race to their beds at the end of the day to get pooch passions treats . ( i used gimborn beef liver treats and wasn't satisfied with them . i even wrote the company when the quality of the treats deteriorated and over half of a bucket would be unusable . ) the quality of pooch passions liver treats is consistently high . these pooch passions treats can be cut in half for tiny little guys like mine . i'm 100 % satisfied and recommend these without reservation . pet test them yourself with your dog and you'll soon be buying them in the large 21 ounce bags as i do . best ever treats ! ! ! !

price reality - list price is really about $ 16 almost purchased - thought that mints that retail for 10 + dollars for a single tin must be pretty good , and amazon was offering 88 % off . . . but in reality the list price is grossly inflated . . . it should not be $ 89 . 94 , but rather just under $ 16 , which makes the discount about 33 % . maybe will still buy , but this is not the bargain it seems . ( rating based on the other review , since amazon will not allow me to skip the rating )

it used to be good but not anymore ! update ! my guess is natural balance has recently changed their chicken & pea l . i . d ( limited ingredient diet ) formula , or their factory has been using different replacement or substandard ingredients ! i have been feeding the chicken & pea l . i . d to my cats for months now & they have been doing great off of it as you can see from my previous review on this product . then , in mid february 2012 , i opened a new bag for my cats and the coloring of the crunchies were a much darker color than they used to be & my cats wouldn't even eat it ! so i went and purchased a new bag from a different store to see if the 1st bag was just a bad batch & this time the crunchies looked normal , however within a week , one of my cats got blood covered stool ( which took 3 months to go away ! ) , and my cat with the sensitive stomach started acting mopey & sick . after 2 weeks he would barely walk around . several tests later the vet found that his intestines were swollen along with his stomach lymph nodes & he had developed pancreatitis . he's off the food now but still recouping . apparently my cat isn't the only one with problems recently with the limited ingredient dry crunchies according to reviews on consumeraffairs . com ! customers on there have the same complaints with the cat & dog dry l . i . d food over the past few months of it doing the same thing to their animals too ! natural balance doesn't have my business any more , that is until they no longer have diamond pet foods package their products . after doing some background research on natural balance , diamond pet foods ( who packages for them ) has constant recalls & complaints . they have one going on right now actually & were one of the biggest culprits during the 2007 major pet food recall . just keep an eye on your pets if you purchase this , and also watch for a runny nose or sneezing , my cat no longer does either since taking him off of this food . original review : five stars ! ! ! ! one of my cats has a very sensitive stomach but does very well on these crunchies ! and my other cat had bad dandruff but after a couple of months on this food its completely gone ! her coat looks beautiful and she doesn't frantically lick her back anymore ! both of my cats seemed to prefer this flavor over the salmon l . i . d but all cats are different . so glad natural balance makes this !

good x - bold dark roast for the price really my title sums up my opinion of this cup altogether . it does make a nice , heart large cup of dark roast coffee , and $ 25 for 48 cups as the preorder price was outstanding . at that price , i don't think i've ever really seen better , but at the same time the brew doesn't seem quite as bold or earthy tasting as a cup of green mountain dark magic or emeril's big easy bold . i prefer a robust large cup on almost every brew , and i've realized that even the ice brew k - cups are basically the same thing ; a cup of coffee with extra grounds for brewing a small amount stronger . . . so i brew iced coffee with my extra bold k - cups . i did the math on weight , and these weigh in at just under a cup of dark magic or sumatran reserve , but i'd still say my favorites ( by taste , ) are the brands i've listed above or tully's italian or french roast , caribou obsidian , starbucks dark sumatra , or even barista prima french and italian roasts . the only other thing i can note about these is that the construction of the pods is about perfect ; i didn't find any grinds in the box leaving me to believe there were no leaking pods . almost all the pods had a little air puffing the foil out ; which i've noticed a lot of the keurig brands have flat foils , anyways , so i'm not even sure if it matters that much , although i've had grinds brew through on some of the flat pods . the only other difference i can mention is the material of the foil top is different than keurig brand pods ; these are slightly harder and smoother ( almost like a plastic or polymer , ) but it doesn't seem to effect the brew process at all , and i didn't seem to get any grinds in my cup , so all in all it just doesn't matter to me . still better than brewing through a regular coffee pot ( even from fresh ground beans , ) and i don't think i'll ever get tired of my keurig coffee maker . 
=================
good product , lousy protection i like these grinder products . very tasty on grilled veggies and meat . but . . . . . . . . like the other reviewer , this product arrived damaged . . . one of the three bottles was shattered and the product was in the bottom of the box all mixed together with the shards of glass . . . nice . i give the product 5 stars and the package protection 1 star . . that averages to 3 stars , but since it ticks me off that i can't return it . . . i give it 2 stars . i feel better now .

great rubber ball , flawed treat design we've had this for about a week now . i have a 1 year old beagle that destroys ever furry " super strong " soft toy , but he isn't interested in a lot of hard toys like tires , etc . we got this hoping that his food motivation would keep him occupied with a toy he can't tear apart . the good : * it is very durable . he hasn't even managed to put a dent it . * we stuck a treat inside it , which is impossible for him to remove . he will happily spend several hours occupied trying to get it out . yaaay ! the ugly : * it took him about 20 mins to pop the regular " everlasting " treat out . without the ball to protect it , it's a 10 minute treat . : - ( he can do this every time now . 
=================
too sweet for me ! this drink - when mixed up - looks and smells quite a bit like lemonade . but once you taste it , you'll find this isn't like any lemonade you've had before . the drink is very sweet - too sweet for me . ( my family and i drink very few sweet drinks , and rarely buy and soft drinks or mix up kool - aid - type drinks . while i do this for personal health reasons , i have to be fair and admit that my taste buds do not find very sweet drinks very likeable . so , while i am biased against this type of drink , if you enjoy very sweet drinks , you'll probably find it more to your liking . ) when my wife and kids tasted this , they also found it to be too sweet for them . my wife actually dumped out the rest of her drink after one sip and said there was no way she was drinking anything that sweet ! we recently also tried the crystal light mocktails appletini , 1 . 69 - ounce ( pack of 4 ) , and we thought that drink was ok - better than this drink . perhaps the developers at crystal light can tone down the sweetness and add in a bit of tartness , instead , and i'd like it better . as it is now , i really can't recommend it to anyone .

very small capacity , takes too long to use , hard to clean . i won the beaba from a blog giveaway , but i don't think i would ever spend the money to buy one . i only used mine about a dozen times before passing it on to a friend . it did everything it was advertised to do . i don't think it saves on time and effort , though . you still have to clean , peel , and cut your fruits or veggies into chunks , so no time saved there . if anything it takes more time to prepare baby food with the beaba simply because it has such a small capacity . you can put about a cup to a cup and a half of chopped raw food in the steamer , which seems like a good amount of food . however , by the time you steam and puree your food , you end up with only about half a cup of baby food , maybe a bit more . let's say you're going to make some sweet potatoes . always a great food to start babies on because it's mild and sweet and can be pureed really smooth and creamy . the beaba can only cook about half of an average sweet potato at a time . i can cook four large sweet potatoes and puree them in my 7 - cup food processor all at once . with the beaba , start to finish , from peeling to chopping to steaming to blending to cooling , you're looking at around 30 to 45 minutes before you can feed your baby . also , food coming out of the beaba is extremely hot , rightly so , but you can't feed a baby food that hot so you have to let it cool , which just adds to your food prep time . anyone who is serious about making most or all of their own baby food is going to want to make baby food in bulk . most busy moms don't have time to waste on a product like the beaba that makes such a small amount of food at a time . just one hour in the kitchen on sunday and i had enough baby food to last all week , if not longer . i have a kitchenaid 7 - cup food processor which i found on sale at bb & b for around sixty bucks . i would steam my veggies and fruits on the stove or even in the microwave , then puree them quickly in the food processor , usually making about 4 cups of baby food at a time . also , one pot , one steamer basket , and one food processor was much easier to clean than the beaba . the beaba streamer basket was stained orange the first time i used it and i didn't care for all the little parts and pieces i needed to clean on the beaba . don't waste your money on fancy or expensive baby food storage containers . gladware makes small 4 - ounce containers . i believe a pack of 8 is under 3 bucks . i would fill about a dozen of these at a time with 3 or 4 different foods and pop them in the freezer . each night before i went to bed , i would pull a couple of containers out of the freezer and stick them in the fridge for the next day . come mealtime , it was fast and easy to scoop out what i needed and warm it up in the microwave . after several months of freezing and heating the little blue lids of the gladware containers would crack , but they're so affordable that i didn't mind tossing some in the recycling bin and buying another set .

these are awesome chocolates , however my 2 bags of dark chocolate covered pomegranate came to me melted into two blocks of chocolate and pomegranate . of course , this also means that the chocolate was dried out . i am going to see if my costco still carries these candies and not buy them by mail again , if i can help it . the box they were shipped in was not even labeled as to special handling of the contents . very poor shipping , amazon . the product gets 5 stars . the ( super saver ) shipping and handling gets no stars . i guess i got what i paid for . ellen

taste before buying a pack of 12 ! my husband loves lifesavers and even though my daughter thought orange mints sounded disgusting i thought these sounded pretty good . there were only six reviews , but since they were all five stars i decided to order the pack of 12 orange mint lifesavers . big mistake ! my daughter put it best when she said they taste like orange medicine . also , why do these contain aspartame ? they aren't sugar free . if you've tasted these and love them , then you should buy them . definitely try these before you buy a pack of 12 .

caraway bread with what might be rye somewhere in there howdy y'all , i've made this bread twice now and i will be giving away the rest of the boxes . [ * sigh . . . * ] it cooks easily and smells wonderful while it cooks . i was dang nigh drooling . unfortunately the caraway is all that i can taste . strong caraway . the comment by another reviewer to add more caraway simply proves that people can be really , really different . [ * grin * ] made it with vegetable oil once and with olive oil . the olive oil may have changed the flavor but i can't tell thru the vastly overpowering taste of caraway . rated a two cuz i was expecting rye with a bit of caraway , not caraway with lots of caraway and a bit of caraway to go with the caraway . if you like lots of caraway - as one reviewer seems to - you'll pro'ly like this bread . i wish they made a version with the caraway dialed way back . i rather like rye bread . take care , lee

good for those whitout an indian / asian / halal market nearby well i dont know about the product itself , but i do know you are better off finding a local indian / asian / halal market in your are and buying from there . if you dont have one then this would be the way to go . . . a better one would be asking a relative that lives in a larger city to buy you some and ship it . . .

best energy drink . bad price i love monster energy drink , but the $ 47 . 89 price for a case is not a good deal . it comes to about $ 2 per can , which is just slightly below what you can buy a single can for at a convenient store . i thought i would find a better deal buying large quantities over the internet , but i guess not . the best deal i have found is 7 - 11 , where a 4 - pack can be had for $ 6 . that's only $ 1 . 50 per can .

two paws down my ten pound yorkie is very food centric when it comes to games - if there isn't food , he isn't playing . we have several bumble balls and kongs that he loves to play with and thought this treat wheel would be a fun new game for him . the yellow playing pieces were much too big for him to get his mouth around and he was unable to master using his paws to flip them out of the holders . for a dog that loves any game that involves food , this just proved much too frustrating for him . and believe me , we tried to help our little guy out with this . we left the yellow cups off and just slightly rotated the wheel , but even that was too difficult for him to " spin " as it did not move easily . and it's not like our dog isn't " paw - centric " as he is actually quite adept at using his paws to move and flip his kong , and to fish treats out from under furniture , etc . we tried over the course of several weeks to try and help our pal get the hang of this toy , but all parties finally agreed that this just wasn't fun the way a toy should be . perhaps if you have a bigger dog this will work for you , but it received two paws down from our little buddy . one other concern that i had was the fact that the small hole in the top of the yellow cups seemed just the right opening for a dog to catch a nail in and get stuck on his paw . granted that on one should ever leave a pet and a toy unattended , but something for people to keep in mind if they do buy this product .

good product you know i would have given this item 5 stars except for the fact that when my package arrived , one of the bottles was opened . the coconut oil is very easily turned into a liquid , and because of this , my package was all slippery and slimy . now i should have returned it but i was too lazy to return so i kept it . the bottle that was not opened was fine and was exactly what i wanted . so besides one of my coconut oil bottles being opened and leaking a little which lead to me throwing it away , all else was fine . 
=================
taste the chemicals , not the beef i should have the read the label more carefully , but the packaging and talk of montana took me in . made in the usa means that beef was turned into jerky in the usa , not the cattle were necessarily raised in the usa , though they might have been . but the real complaint is the flavor , which seems to be the taste of preservative and msg with some hard - to - identify spice and unconvincing hickory flavor . this is a relatively dry jerky which you have to chew - - but that's a good thing in my view since that's how " real " jerky is . but " real " jerky isn't overcome with preservatives and enhancers .

the salt brings out the flavor of semi - sweet milk chocolate the principal ingredient of this bar is sugar . it also contains milk . the cocoa content is less than 50 % . if you are looking for a semi - sweet dark milk chocolate this could be very satisfying . if , like me , you prefer a high cocoa content without milk and all that sugar you will be disappointed and resent the misleading labeling . 
=================
overpriced i love these gummy bears but i can buy the same bag 6 lb bag for $ 5 . 96 at samsclub . thus the amazon price is a rip off . i wish amazon would work to provide us the lowest prices .

too hot ! i love brad's naked chips . but these suck . i normally do love nacho cheese , but it hurts my mouth to eat these . they're too hot . 
=================
these definitely taste like " diet " chips after reading several reviews from people apparently on diets i now understand the high star rating because if you can't have the real thing something like this passes for good . these are bland , have a weird texture and aren't very good . i will be sending these to work with my husband so he can give them away . i ate a few from my first and only bag before throwing them in the pantry . they are low in calories and low in taste . pass . 
=================
not very tasty . my boys were not fond of these at all . they are used to the taste and texture of gluten free foods , but even with them being used to them , they couldn't stomach these . i wish amazon carried the mi - del gluten free animal crackers , as they are very tasty and my boys love those . ( we dipped these ones in nutella so they'd eat these ones ) . 
=================
seems * way * pricey i confess that i have not bought this product as listed . i'm writing to alert the seller and any potential buyers that this price , $ 7 . 99 for one packet of four chazuke servings , is ridiculously high . is the description wrong , and this is actually more than one packet ? is the seller really trying to get a 300 % markup over regular retail just for selling through amazon ? if you're thinking of buying nagatanien ochazuke , you're better off buying the ones sold by uwajimaya . amazon carries these as well , under the " more buying choices " box that ( for me at least ) shows up on the right of the screen . 
=================
costs double of what it does at warehouse stores this products costs about $ 12 plus tax at most warehouse stores . i usually buy this item from bjs or sams club stores but wanted to see what the amazon price would be . even with the subscribe and save program , it still costs $ 17 . . . this sale price is a total rip - off ! ! ! !

uh - oh - it's broken i ordered the " people usually buy " items package : swirl chocolate seashells , pearl seasheels and starfish - 2 out ofthe 3 look wonderful - however , the largest item and the one to be used on the bridal shower cake - the large starfish arrived broken . not sure if seller will replace .

not a big fan of anchovy , but like these . i really am not to fond of anchovy . but i do like these in small amounts . mostly in italian dishes my grandma taught me . but i do not use as much as she did . they cook down nicely into tomato sauces & fish soup or stew . if you like anchovy more than i do you might really like these . i think the price is a little high . good thing i am not overly fond of these .

an expensive snack for 4 . 48oz of food . the box says this is a meal and @ $ 5 . 00 and 400 calories it should be a meal , it's not . inside the box there are packages of crackers , a nut fruit mix , chili lime salmon , edamame and a square of chocolate . when i opened the box i was a little disappointed at the serving size of the chili lime salmon compared to the size of the edamame . for the price i would expect more salmon and less edamame to make up the 22gms of protein , my mistake . the salmon looks like baby food but it is tasty . there is a fork and not a knife in the box which makes it hard to get all of the salmon from the little container . the edamame is over dried with not much taste . it gets kind of powdery when you chew it and it made me cough from the texture getting caught in the back of my throat . you'll need a lot of water to wash them down with . i had to give up eating them because they kept choking me . i did enjoy the fruit and nut mix and the chocolate was really good so it wasn't a total loss . i consider the the price to be the biggest negative in this review . at almost $ 5 . 00 a box this is an expensive snack . i won't be buying this .

if used properly , safer brand effectively controls moths not too long ago , our daughter arrived at our house after a year away from home with bags full of clothes that were full of moths . to this day , she rejects that notion that she brought such a scourge to our family home , but the facts speak for themselves . the day before our daughter arrived home , there was not a moth to be found . the day after she landed and unceremoniously dumped her bags in the front hall closet , i opened the door to that same closet and turned on the light only to be met by the frantic flutterings of a newly arrived population of moths that were scurrying as quickly as their little dusty wings could take them into the dark corners , away from my dropped jaw and curses . i took action immediately . first , i closed the door , hoping for containment . second , i gently scolded my daughter with the reminder that , unlike her , we actually enjoyed the pleasure of a clean , vermin - free home . third , i went online to check out the relative safety of the more toxic insecticides such as " moth crystals " that kill everything - - adults , larva , and eggs . fourth , i decided that i could not seal the hall closet tightly enough to prevent toxic fumes of the conventional insecticides from entering our living space ; fifth , i searched for safer alternatives and found . . . you guessed it . . . safer brand 7270 clothes moth alert trap . i read the mixed reviews for safer brand . many were promising , but some were halfhearted . having wrestled with all manner of crawling interlopers in my home ( lice , fleas , etc . ) , i concluded that the less enthusiastic reviews were most likely a result of user error or , at the very least , the purchaser's own lack of diligence in follow through after correctly applying the product . i , on the other hand , am one of those classic obsessive compulsive types who takes on a challenge like this with the determination of a marathon runner ( make that " triathlete " ) . my husband would smirk at such an analogy since the only experience i have that even approximates exercise is the vigorous typing i do on my computer ; but , hey , one finds analogies where one can , right ? so , on with the story . after reading the instructions and carefully positioning about three traps in every closet of my home , i also followed up with a thorough vacuuming of each closet and put the more seductive wool / silk items into thick , black , plastic bags ( the kind you get at the hardware store that are usually called " contractor's bags " ) . i also installed a third tier of defense by placing a few bowls of cedar balls in each closet . finally , i left one small wool scrap hanging in each closet to lure the moths . i am nothing if not devious . then , i waited . in fact , i was gone for several weeks on vacation , and when i returned , much moth activity had occurred . the verdict ? the traps worked wonderfully when combined with my other " moth attack " measures . the corpses of dead , desiccated moths littered the traps . there were no holes or visible eggs on the wool " lure , " but i disposed of those scraps just to be safe . then , i continued to search for moths in the less accessible parts of the closet - - higher up on the walls , in the seams between carpet and baseboard , and in all the ceiling corners . i found no moth activity . i replaced the first batch of traps with a second round after a few months , and i continue to have zero moths to this day . end of story .

starbucks needn't worry ! i'm a big fan of coffee , so this beverage piqued my interest . i have tried starbucks drinks both at starbucks coffee shops and from the supermarket . i like them . this drink is not as sweet . it seems there's just enough sugar to take the bitter edge off . when ice is added it makes a refreshing enough warm weather beverage , though i have tasted better . what the product has going for it is convenience . the 6 . 8 - ounce cans are easy to store in the refrigerator and can be taken out and drunk quickly . no process of first making iced coffee . that's a definite plus . it is not as satisfying at room temperature . the flavor , apart from being strong , is harsh to the taste and does not provide the satisfaction that a starbucks or other espresso drinks in a can / bottle do . as a pick - me - up , the drink is appropriate , since its hefty dose of caffeine will give the drinker an infusion of energy . compared to other similar drinks on the market , sugar content is low ( which accounts for its bitterness ) . for those averse to caffeine or those who have trouble sleeping if they drink too much brewed coffee , this beverage is a no - no . these days , many folks have cut down on caffeine intake , so this product might be counterproductive to weaning oneself from addictive caffeine .

love nutramigen but do not pay this price i love nutramigen for how it helped my daughter through some difficult times . i used the concentrate cans quite frequently but never paid this much for it . if you can find a local retailer that does " can can " sales ; ) you can find the same for half the price . at least purchase directly through enfamil . this formula is expensive enough as is without this vendor trying to take you for a ride . for shame !

no longer as advertised the first two cases i bought were very satisfactory . i mixed the coconut milk into a shake , along with bananas and cocoa and drank it straight . it was great , very fresh . i could use it on anything : salads , etc . the third case i bought had a completely different texture , smooth and creamy versus the flaky , part solid / part liquid texture of the first two cases . unsure about it , i put a sparing amount in my shake . minutes later , my stomach starting to act up . it couldn't digest this coconut milk properly . my wife's stomach's reaction was even worse than mine . ( i've also had a similar reaction before with another brand of coconut milk , bought much less expensively at an asian grocery ) . so then i looked at the ingredients , and lo and behold , there were at the end : " guar gum , stabilizers . " looking back at the description of this item here on amazon , i see it says " no preservatives . no stabilizers . " i also have found from other reviews that people have discovered the ingredients have changed . a once - great product is no longer , and in fact , is not as advertised .

chia seeds have great effect , but taste is awful so i will confess , i really feel better and more energized on less sleep when i drink one of these , but this particular brand tastes unbelievably bad . as if it had aspartame in it , though it does not list it in the ingredients . i've tried another chia drink ( different brand ) and it was lip - smackingly delicious , so i will surely not buy any more of these . also , the other brand ( found at whole foods - i'll update the name when i remember ) costs about the same or less for 10oz vs the 8oz of this one .

outrageous price increase one must be really careful buying some things ( like cat food ) on the internet . all of my past reviews for products on amazon have been positive , but this one defies logic . the food is wonderful and we have used it at our animal rescue for over eight years now . we usually buy 4 to 6 bags at a time . a month or so ago amazon raised their price for it from $ 15 . 59 a bag to $ 24 . 44 . amazon still sells the same around $ 17 a bag through other vendors ( such as petco ) but then you get socked with high shipping charges and sales taxes . i realize that , generally , prices for products tend to increase over time , but this price increase seems particularly onerous , especially when one can obtain the product from other providers for aorund $ 16 with free postage .

good price , not so great flavor i bought this nori to have friends over to make sushi . it works well enough for the purpose of keeping your sushi rolled up , but in terms of the flavor of the nori itself , it is not very good . it has sort of a heavy , bitter flavor . i prefer a lighter nutty flavored nori . 
=================
try the other flavors first ! while i highly recommend spry gum , especially since xylitol is good for your teeth and gums , this flavor is weak and the gum is tougher to chew . 
=================
doesn't have the 'corny' taste of regular yellow as has already been noted , the kernels are a bit smaller than the regular yellow variety and , to me anyway , less flavorful . i've been using a west bend microwave popper . the 'pops' are a good deal less robust than the yellow variety when popped by this method . more like 'pfft corn' . the texture has a lot more crunch to it than the pillowy yellow puffs . 
=================
the product works but nobody knows how to use it right due to packing issues . okay , based on a you tube video that i found , the product is applied post shower and hair drying / styling . part the hair in sections . rub one finger lighly over the product and then apply directly to the scalp only . repeat only over areas of the scalp needing treatment . minimal product is needed . one jar should last quite awhile and , on the areas i've tested , the product does work . i give this product four - stars because it does work but i'm deducting two stars because the packaging developers failed to communicate instructions and caused way too many people stress and damaged hair . although i do hold the packaging developers accountable for the number of bad reviews , i am dumbfounded at the number of customers who used this product without doing any research as how to properly apply it . a quick web search brings up a video on youtube that would have eliminated frustration and hair damage . not saying that the manufacturer should have neglected to put proper instructions on the jar or attached them somehow . honestly , what if hair loss was the result of mis - application ? if there is computer access available to leave a review . . . the same technology would have avoided the situation that caused the negative review . the negative reviews are justified because of the packaging but why risk the damage when a search engine would have prevented it ? that's all i'm saying .

almonds ? tiny pieces ! are you kidding me ? ! i just ate half of a 4 . 25 ounce hershey's milk chocolate with almonds bar and found zero , zip , - 0 - whole almonds . in fact , i found nothing close to an entire almond . . . the biggest was maybe a third of one half of a single nut ! really ? ! that is nuts ! i am sick of companies cheaping out on consumers . for my entire 58 yr . life , my favorite chocolate , without exception , and including the likes of other crowd favorites like godiva , has been hershey's . but this cost - cutting stuff by hershey's ? how can this be true ? okay , maybe it's acceptable to put " pieces " ( taste like stale floor sweepings ) into halloween - sized very small bars , but , please , not into the larger candy bars that earned hershey's such a great brand name ! keep it up and you will lose customers like me who know quality from crap . charge more but don't listen to the corporate idiots telling you it's okay to sub almond pieces for almonds . please chime in if you know what i am talking about !

it reseals ; that is the best thing i can say i have been drinking coconut water for several years and have tried almost every brand . i finally found the best one - by a long shot : taste nirvana brand . still , when i saw coco libre organic coconut water on sale at a local store , i immediately purchased one to compare it . if i hadn't been so thirsty , i would have tossed it after the first swallow . it's the latest in a series of " natural " coconut waters that are anything but . it tastes cooked , tastes like it has additives in it ( it's from concentrate ) and it tastes flat and slightly plasticky . it's really unappealing to me . the fact that you can reseal the bottle is nice , but no reason to subject yourself to an inferior product . taste nirvana is incrediblly light and fresh ; it seems like my cells just absorb it instantly . there is no aftertaste and the product is fantastic from batch to batch . i like the size in the cans , but taste nirvana also comes in resealable bottles that are the same size as coco libre . do yourself a favor and buy taste nirvana instead . no , i am not affiliated in any way with the company , but i do really respect and support products that are clean , as close to truly natural as possible , and delicious . coco libre is not .

be very afraid i am not pleased with this seller at all . i have done business at amazon on multiple occasions , and have always been pleased , if not down - right delighted with the whole process , but this most recent transaction , the purchase of the mexican vanilla totonacs has me extemely , shall we say wary , therefor i must make people aware , as well as amazon . com . i made my purchase last night ( tues . 27th ) and today , at 1 : 29p . m . i received a call from my financial institution for possible fraudulent charges on my account . less than 18 hours from my transaction , to the time my cu had to put a fraud notice on that account . in the 25 minutes it took me to drive into town to get to my cu , another charge had been attempted on it . my recommendation is to not do any business with this company until it's sorted out , since i've never had problems with amazon before this experience . amazon , you may want to verify this group with whom you're doing business , and warn your other customers .

ripoff ! you can buy these at big lots for 50cents each ! ! this item is too expensive online . great product but can find it cheaper elsewhere . big lots

fungus although the product grew very quickly ( within one week ) and our cats absolutely loved the product , we ended up throwing it in the trash after two weeks because of some sort of mold or fungal growth . i'm assuming that the particular seeds used in the product must be more prone to fungal growth . we kept the pot in the laundry room during the day so the cats wouldn't eat themselves silly , so perhaps the location was too warm in addition to the contents staying moist all the time . regardless , i would never purchase this product again because i don't want to risk my cats getting sick from it . we are trying other brands of kitty grass to see how the will work - we're trying to satisfy their craving for greens so they will stop eating my houseplants .

senseo abandons us market apparently , senseo has decided to abandoned the us market . it is nearly impossible to find senseo at any of the traditional retailers , including amazon , walmart , or target . walmart is carrying melitta brand pods that work in the senseo , but the quality is not as good . it is interesting to note amazon continues to list the senseo brand in email blast , but the items are always out of stock . i wrote senseo customer service about the issue , but they failed to respond . i'm going back to costco brand ground coffee and the old reliable mr . coffee or bunn for the morning jolt . i refuse to buy into another expensive pod or k - cup single serve system that changes as often as gillette changes razor blade models .

not good for espresso machine after trying different lavazza espresso whole beans i wanted to give thisone a try and ordered lavazza grand espresso . i have checked the uk andgerman sites to get some idea about the rating for this one since there are not enough reviews for this one . the ratings were not very impressive compareto other lavazza whole beans ( very close to lavazza super crema which ihave ordered through amazon ) but i wanted to make my own experience . when i oppened the package i saw seemingly oily coffee beans compare to other lavazza or illy espresso beans . i have a miele automatic espresso machine which was not very amused abouthis new partner but it was too late to refuse the experiment . grand espresso has a very good crema which is a result of high robusta and normal bucket ( aroma ) . composition 40 % arabica 60 % robusta . as cappuccino i was not very impressed compare to other lavazza espressobeans . it tastes very weak ( i have used whole foods whole milk ) . at the end you get what you have paid for . a lavazza brand which is in thebottom of lavazza whole beans next to lavazza super crema and lavazza tierra . for me the first choice for lavazza espresso is pienaroma if it is fresh ( ihave bought it through amazon for about two years ago which was damaged / sourbut otherwise it is the top choice and the most expencive lavazza in europe ) made from 100 % arabica beans and very espresso machine friendly like all other lavazza beans ( except grand espresso ! ) followed by lavazza top class . for cappuccino my first choice is lavazza top class which has a very nice chocolaty and sweet note followed by none ( even better than illy ) . for me the best espresso is illy dark roast ( unfortunately overpriced ) followed by lavazza pienaroma ( best price / quality ) . for cappuccino i would always go with lavazza top class followed by segafredoextra strong . i would not recommend lavazza grand espresso for espresso machines a la mieleor jura . the fat beans would cause damages for espresso machines . if you have regular / filter coffee machine i would see it comparable to lavazza super crema or tierra ( which i also would definately not buy again ) .

barney butter crunchy almond butter my husband is allergic to peanuts so he can't eat peanut butter - obviously but he can eat this . i had to try this and it does taste pretty much like peanut butter . which is almost too bad , i like almonds and would rather it would taste more like almonds . this is salty like peanut butter too . . . so if you can't digest peanut butter this is the product for you .

nice idea , but can't be used like a regular kitchen bag gets used i love biobags , and use the doggie bags religiously . however , the kitchen bags don't hold up to being stuffed or overstuffed . they stick , rip , leak , and have only worked for me ( i use a simplehuman butterfly step can ) when i double - bag . like the other reviewed said , they would work great if you are just putting compost in , or in my case i use it to line my bedroom trash and that works great . they can't be filled to the max with heavy trash .

honestly little more than water not a whole lot of honest - to - goodness fruit in honest ade . i tried them for the first time yesterday , and was disappointed by just about everything i saw and tasted . it basically tastes like what you get when you finish drinking a glass of fruit juice , then drink water from the glass without rinsing it first . although the bottle is labeled 16 . 9 ounces , i was disappointed to find , when i looked at the bottom of the bottle , that it is acutely concave and pushed in more almost two inches from the bottle's base ; that is , it's one of those " secretly shrinking " packages that looks like it contains a larger quantity than it actually does . a more honest 16 . 9 - ounce bottle could have been about two inches shorter . speaking of honesty , the top ingredients in this drink are water and sugar . there is just enough pom and blueberry juice to color the water a light purple , and no more . there's virtually no nutritional value to the drink , so the pom and blueberry are not in high enough quantities to provide any antioxidants . if you are looking for the benefits of pomegranate and blueberries , buy 100 % real juice , and drink that . then , when you're done drinking it , you can fill up the glass with water and a little sugar , and pretty much get honest ade for free .

no chems ? i've been buying this product for several years after seeing an article in the paper about the maker in oregon . sounds like there are no chemicals in his process . i've never used any other brand , but noticed today that whole foods has both white & black truffle oils from italy . it seemed the prices for us & italian were about the same . my next ingredient for a recipe in 'cuisine at home' is truffle butter for a pasta sauce . they suggest as an added flavor boost to use truffle oil instead of the recipe's olive oil . i'm getting hungry !

like the old formula better my kids have been drinking this milk for years . my older son is essentially a vegetarian , and we have relied on this milk for a big percentage of his daily protein and calcium . he is also a very picky eater , so he noticed immediately the change to low - fat . i know , it has less sugar , but that's a deal - breaker for him . we're willing to let him have that extra sugar , if that's the price we have to pay for him to get his protein . needless to say , we will be looking for a different brand . btw , i know i'm not alone . i started buying this milk on amazon because it would sell out at all the stores in the city i live . now there's a glut of the new low - fat milk at all the stores .

a snack for everyone in the family bought it for a gift . arrived in perfect condition and made a great presentation . there was something in the basket for everyone in the family . products were all the favorite snacks like nuts , cookies , taffy , summer sausage but much more intriguing - the basket was opened immediately so everyone could try a malt shop taffy ( chocolate shake , rootbeer float and cherry cola ! ) . the all natural nuts were fresh and crunchy and the sausage was delicious on its own but even better with the mustard that accompanied it . * i ordered this basket when my wife gave me the task of buying a present for a party . in my quick perusal of amazon , i felt i completed my assignment perfectly . my wife , of course , checked up on my order and was horrified to see i ordered something that received some 1 star reviews . the days were looooong until the package showed up and i was accused , more than once , of not being detail oriented enough . thankfully i was absolutely vindicated when the basket arrived . after reading the other reviewers ( and reading what " vine " was ) clearly there was a mix up with the baskets sent to that program - that seems to happen early so they are the first reviews - which unfortunately caused me agita ( why i am even taking the time to write this ) . i hope no one else will be confused by this very strange situation . and no , if i realized i would have been in the dog house for the shipping period , i wouldn't have picked this item - - however , for the record , i was right .

price keeps going up and up wow , i just ordered this a couple months ago at $ 14 prime , and now it's up $ 9 . what's up with all this , everything is going up by $ 10 bucks or more ( can goods , etc . ) . instead of making it worth our while to have subscriptions on regular items that we always use , they are pricing themselves out of the market , so when i have to go to the store , i'll buy the store brand , and they not only lose , but lose twice . crazy stupid marketing plan .

never a refusal my pug never refuses a chew stick ! its good for his teeth being enzymatic anda safe chewable product .

defective bags the popcorn is great . unfortunately , the bags are defective and the buttery flavoring has seeped out thus making the outside of the bags oily . i place the bags on paper towels to microwave ! 
=================
do your homework ! these bags are very small . they are 67 cents each at the wal - mart . i should have done my homework first , but needed these in a hurry for a party .

corn is the # 1 ingredient . . . . purina beneful has not been out for long , but it has become hugely popular ! my sister just switched her dog to it this summer , because he was having some stomach issues ; she thought a new dog food might be a good idea . ( his stomach issues quit right before she switched , though . ) she was feeding purina one chicken & rice dog food , 4 - pound bags ( pack of 6 ) , which is an excellent dog food , with meat as the first ingredient . corn is the first ingredient in beneful . corn is a filler food , and not really good for dogs , cats , ferrets , etc . yet , so many animal feeds have it , including many of the outrageously expensive science diets . and so many pets have eaten corn based food their entire lives , and lived a long , long time . you could go nuts figuring out what to feed your pets ! ( oh , and don't feed your ferrets nuts ! ) personally , i think purina one is a far superior feed over beneful . that's what i feed my cats - - purina one cat smartblend chicken and rice cat food , 16 - pound . ( oh , and my ferrets , too - - purina one kitten growth & dev , 7 - pounds . ) but my sister's dog loves beneful , is doing fine on it , and she's sticking with it right now . she says her dog needed more vegetables . : ) 
=================
not bad i was expecting this coffee to have a bit more flavor . i usually drink starbucks and i do like to try different beans , but i don't think i'll get this one again . it wasn't bad , but still i felt it was missing flavor for a dark roast . 
=================
outrageous price increase wonderful product , no doubt about it ! but amazon . com just increased the price by 63 % at one fell swoop . i'll shop for it elsewhere , thank you . ( date of review : feb . 18 , 2011 )

baffling for a health product , why does this contain high fructose corn syrup ? the additive provides no value to a person and according to current research may actually be harmful . benecol should offer it sugar free . if coke & pepsi can offer sugar free products , why can't benecol ? 
=================
100 % natural meaty mammoth boner i have a pet saber tooth tiger that loves tasty snacks like bones , meat chunks , cow gristle , etc . i was looking for something that would take time for him to chew . the mammoth bone is perfect , since the woolly mammoth is a natural prey of a saber tooth tiger . i wouldn't say it's " meaty " since a bone by definition has no meat . i guess the brown part of it is some type of ligament or chunks of skin that didn't get pulled off in the factory . it's costly to get a bone really clean unless you use hydraulic acid , but then , it wouldn't be " 100 % natural " and it'd probably be very dangerous for animals or termites to eat . i've tried the bone a few times , it has a zesty flavor to it , sort of like it was barbecued on an open pit flame and doused with vinegar and pork grinds . i don't think if your dog is a vegetarian , that he would like this because it comes from some animal part i'm guessing . which part , i don't yet know . also , there's no instructions , so if you have small weiner dogs , you might want to grind this up before giving it to them since it can crush their aorta . 
=================
i've seen my dog eat everything but these my 3 year old lab loves all treats , but not these . when he loves a treat , he will eat it right away . with these , he buries them in the backyard , lets them rot for a month or two , then hides them in my couch and i find them quite some time later ( ew ) . i really have seen him eat everything ( whether he should or shouldn't ) , but he would not eat these if his life depended on it .

too sweet . . . don't need maple or honey . . . people are switching from peanut butter to almond butter mainly for health reasons . . . doing so means giving up mr . peanut , and this is sometimes tough to do . . . so , in order to make the switch easier , gimmicks are employed to help with this . . . adding honey , sugar , and maple syrup are a few of the ways this is done ( and yes , they do this with peanut butter too ) . i purchased this product and i think it is quite good . . . problem is that it is too sweet . i use the trader joe's almond butter with flax seeds and the taste is great . . . cheaper too . . . . a little more of an oily consistency though . i will now order the justin's almond butter without any gimmicky sweeteners . truth be told . . . good almond butter tastes sweet provided the almonds are roasted thoroughly . if you have a sweet - tooth , get this . . if you want to stay in line with health and not intake a little more sugar than you need , go with the one without the maple or honey . . . you shouldn't miss the unnecessary sugars . . . * * update . . . i got in the standard justin's almond butter and yuck ! now i know why everyone wants to mask the stuff with maple . it's like they forgot to roast the almonds . . . i don't get it . i'm going back to trader joe's almond butter with flax seeds . . . yeah , it's a little looser , but the taste is vastly better . i was hoping justin's could do better . . . they simply can't . . . and for this price , they should ! * * update 2 . . . okay , i'm back with the honey flavor and we enjoy . . . it just took some time to grow on us . i upped the star rating to 5 where it should be . . . it's good stuff ! ! 
=================
i was too late ! i really can't evaluate this product fairly because my husband devoured the stuff before i had a chance to even taste one . i guess that qualifies as a good review , though , doesn't it ? 
=================
good houses , but one out of four broken the houses were good , plenty of candy , and the kids were happy but one of the four i ordered arrived broken , too broken to fix up with frosting . 
=================
quality control is non - existing with this brand i love the peach flavor . . . . but every - other can rates different . i tried different flavors with the same result . it does taste great when they get it right . 
=================
don't use on hardwood floors our corgi really loved this food toy / game . the only problem , we have hardwood floors and the toy was going to destroy our floors . so we're pretty bummed , but the dog won't be using this after just one day . hardwood floors are too expensive to ruin for this toy . if you have wall to wall carpet or another type of flooring that a hard object won't damage it's great ! 
=================
this variation of switch carbonated juice doesn't work for me . . . as part of the line of switch products , switch kiwi berry offers a ( slightly ) healthier alternative to carbonated soda . the product is 100 % juice , though the majority of the contents are neither kiwi fruit or " berry " : ingredients : 100 % juice ( filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates , apple , grape , kiwi , acerola , raspberry and strawberry juice concentrates ) , natural flavors , ascorbic acid ( vitamin c ) . unfortunately , the mix of kiwi and berry flavors in this concoction just does not work for me . the added kiwi flavor , in particular , imparts a odd sour aftertaste that i just could not get used to . my children each tried a sip , and for them as well the opinion was mixed . i was pleasantly surprised by the switch black cherry ( even though the cherry flavor was a bit weak ) , but i can't be very enthusiastic about this flavor .

best with feline pine litter box i have had a cat and a kitten for about 6 months now . i had tried a myriad of kitty litters prior to settling on feline pine . since one was a kitten and both came from a shelter , i don't think the cats were particularly picky about their litter . i switched them from clay to pine pellets without using any transition and they were unphased . after using feline pine for a few weeks , i decided to go ahead and buy two of the litter boxes made for the litter . having the ability to sift out the sawdust ( which is created when cat urine breaks down the pine pellets ) into the bottom pan has made litter box cleanup super easy ! this is what i do : 1 . scoop solids once per day and shake the box side to side in the evening to move any sawdust that the cats didn't scratch down into the bottom pan . 2 . empty the bottom pan about one time per week by dumping into a 5 - gallon bucket with lid . 3 . place a few of the slightly broken down pellets ( those that have been in the litter box for a week ) into the bottom pan . this keeps the sawdust from sticking to the bottom pan and makes dumping easier . 4 . add some fresh pellets to top tray if it looks too shallow . i do this when dumping bottom tray . 5 . completely empty the top tray about one time per month . place some old pellets in bottom tray as stated above . you can apparently use the sawdust as compost . i prefer to get rid of it by dumping the 5 - gallon bucket into a trashbag when full . then again , i also have dogs and i worry they would get into the compost . another note - a 20 - 25lb . bag lasted me about a month ( with a little left over ) and that took care of two litter boxes . my final suggestion . . . and this has been mentioned before . . . if you have a local farm store such as a tractor supply company , look for equine pine which is horse bedding . it is the same thing , but costs far less . up until recently , i was buying feline pine at $ 9 - 11 for a 20 - 25lb . bag . i found equine pine for about $ 6 . 50 for a 40lb . bag . much cheaper ! 
=================
mistake in the pricing for sure ! ! ! ! ! ! this product is not worth more than $ 2 . 50 per box . the grocery stores are selling it for around $ 4 per box ( pack of 10 ) . this vendor is surely ripping off customers with this price . amazon . . . . . . . . . . . please do something about this vendor . 
=================
ranch flavor 14 % fat , and 4 grams of sugar in 2 ounces of food . not very healthy in any shape or form . no different than most potatoe chips in reality . you just need to eat raw , and this may be 95 % raw , but the other 5 % isnt . 
=================
not a 10 lb box i have purchased items from fantastic foods before and i love all of their products . easy to make for quick meals and they taste great . i was very excited to see that amazon . com has these items in bulk so i purchased a few . all products arrived in great condition except the vegetarian chili mix arrived in a bag and not a box like the other items and it is not 10 lbs . judging by the size of it compared to the other items , it weighs around 5 lbs . amazon . com customer service is sending a replacement , hopefully it will be the right size . 
=================
read the product description before buying these aren't meant to be a meal , they're meant to be a fun novelty , and for everyone complaining and moaning about the size , read the product description before buying , it clearly gives the size .

a quote from my dog my dog wanted to do this review for you guys . i said sure . dog : " nom nom nom . . . . medicine ! ? what medicine ? ? ? " 
=================
only 4 flavors i ordered this to try a varity of samples to see which flavors i would like , instead i get only 4 flavors there you'd be no more than two f a kind to get a good cross sampling of flavors . 
=================
sweet but not so sweet i wanted to try this product to replace stevia based sweeteners which i find have a bitter aftertaste . although it's a very nice sweetener you have to use more than sugar - it is just not that sweet . also it's prohibitive for baking because it's so expensive . i really wanted to love this product but it's got some issues . 
=================
our dog seemed to like these our dog seemed to really go for these treats , she would go through them in a couple of minutes , which is pretty quick for her . i will say that she doesn't have any digestive problems ( other than the occasional gross noise here and there , but i could say the same about myself ) . so i didn't notice any issues before or after , which is fine by me . 
=================
not exactly this was a gift for an employee . what she received was not the variety i expected from the the description or the picture but she was very happy with it . the basket ended up being all chocolate .

very bad packaged juan valdez coffee here in the us isn't cheap so i expect to receive what i ordered in good shape and on time . . . for a 3 . 52oz ( pack of 3 ) coffee that cost me 7 $ each and one of them came broken ( i couldn't use it ) . . . i'm not satisfied . 
=================
a good thing it was a gift bought this as a requested gift . kind of sick looking when i got it , but the receipant was thrilled with it .

love oreo's , but - - - - - it said it was double stuff and it wasnt . it was a just a single layer like regular oreo's . i didnt really like them , i had a couple of them , my roommate liked them and i sent some home with my grandson . 
=================
bully sticks vs raw hide i dont think a lot of pet owners realize that the reason raw hides are cheaper is because your pets can choke on them . they can rip chunks of the stuff off while chewing and it will expand after they swallow and choke . there have also been many cases of raw hides being contaminated with salmonella especially those imported from china . i have a friend whose little maltese got salmonella from a little raw hide stick off those cute christmas gift bags . she got lucky and got better but it took a couple of months and was on lots of anti - bionics . most shelters & rescue groups will not accept raw hides as donations . so although bully sticks and tripe are pricier , they have better nutrition as well as safety for your pet . as a precaution , make sure they are not imported from china . 
=================
i think you should buy this sure the price here is way way above what you have to pay just about anywhere else , but hey the carbonator is great and saves garbage pileup . soda stream has a great product and i have used the exchange service , i just paid a lot less than here . 
=================
used it once , but never again bought this paste in my local grocery store because it was the only thing they had , plus i didn't know any better . was making curried butternut squash bisque for the first time . the bisque was good , but little did i know , it could have been much better . because this product was so expensive - - it took a whole jar to give my bisque a mild curry flavor - - i looked to amazon for an alternative . found mae ploy thai red curry paste - 14 ounce per jar and gave it a try . prepared the same butternut squash bisque and oh . my . goodness ! what a difference ! ! try the mae ploy . . . you will get a huge container for a fraction of the cost , and the taste will be better than you ever knew was possible . kept in the fridge , it keeps for a good long while . but , when you taste the wonderful flavor , you'll be looking for recipes calling for curry paste . try the yellow and the green curry too . totally different tastes . 
=================
holy gas batman ! i love kashi products . i think they taste great and the health stats are sublime . it is with great pain ( literal and figurative ) that i rate this a 2 - star product . i must be in the minority , but about 2 hours after eating any of the go - lean cereals i experience pain inducing intestinal gas ( farts ) . google it if you don't believe me . if this didn't turn my stomach into a pressurized cannon , i would easily rate it 5 - stars . it's healthy , tastes great , can be found on sale for the price of regular cereal , and amazon has it for subscribe and save . unfortunately , i am one of the seeming minority who will have to stop eating this after making the connection to it's terrible gas inducing powers .

190 calories of cocoa sorry , but pure naturals chocolate almond bar did not answer my chocolate prayers . it was like eating 190 calories of cocoa , period . thankfully , i had some leftover coffee in my mug to wash it down .

excellent product , but . . . . . excellent product ! ! i've tried several different brands of various so - called " popcorn oils " over the years , including one marketed by the elderly gentleman who we all know and love for his popcorn , all of which seem to be made of soybean , canola , or something even worse , and which , quite frankly , taste as bad as they sound . none of them even come close when compared to coconut oil , either taste - wise or healthwise - yes , i said healthwise , check it out - and this " real theater " brand of flavored coconut oil is without question the best my wife and i have ever used . we own an old - fashioned movie theater style popcorn maker , so i can't vouch for popcorn made on the stove , but there's no reason why there should be any difference in flavor no matter how it is made . please remember that this is coconut oil , and unlike other oils , it will tend to solidify at ambient temperatures of maybe 70 degrees f or cooler . the product label doesn't explain this for some reason , but it's a natural occurrence for coconut oil . anyway , you can simply scoop out the amount of oil you need , but i suggest placing the container in some luke - warm water until the oil returns to a fully liquid state - maybe 5 minutes or less , and then pour out the amount needed . it doesn't need to be refrigerated after it's opened , and has a virtually unlimited shelf life . the " but " in the title line refers to problems we had with the vendor when it came to our shipment , but this is after all a product review , not a customer service critique . 
=================
great nutrition , but my cat won't eat it . i really wanted my cat to like this food ( especially considering how expensive it is ) , but she just doesn't want to eat it . i introduced the food to her by mixing it in with her old " junk food " dry kibble , as recommended . she simply eats around the wellness kibble , and i find little bits of it slightly chewed up / spit out by her bowl . i've been testing to see what happens if i don't feed her again until she clears her little bowl of food , but she just mopes around howling ( something she normally doesn't do ) and starves herself instead of eating the wellness kibble . what a waste . : ( 
=================
order fulfillment / warehouse problems ? the product i ordered was fine ; the price , vis - a - vis supermarket , was excellent ! delivery time , great . but what i ordered was a 6 - units - for - the - price grocery thing . what i got was a single unit , not the 6 . when i called about this , the mistake was corrected immediately , so that was good . and i got to keep the single unit i received free . that was nice . still , you may have a picking - and - packing problem in the dog - treat division . any ideas on how to avoid this ? the order form doesn't supply any alert mechanism . so i guess the picker just has to read the order more carefully ? 
=================
good , but not pure single fruit for each flavor i had watermelon pop made by the coca - cola company for china while at epcot center's coke pavilion in the past and wondered why they never marketed it in the usa because it's excellent . so when i saw watermelon berry as a flavor with switch and that it was pure juice besides , i had to try it and all their flavors . overall , the watermelon doesn't disappoint and does remind me of that soda , but probably better having real juice in it . but all the flavors , in addition to the described flavors have added juices to them that have nothing to do with the flavor ( i . e . apple and acerola ) . for flavors like lemon and lime this makes sense because if they didn't have other juices added they would be very sour with no added sugar , but it is disappointing for flavors like grape where those additions clearly subtract from the " grape juice " flavor , which i'd prefer to be stronger . even so , it still tastes better than grape soda and grape is the strongest flavor . none of the flavors here are 'bad' at all . all taste better than flavored soda , imo and have to be much better for you with plenty of vitamin c and no added sugar ( fructose is better for you than sucrose ) . certainly , having carbonation in juice ( particularly the orange flavor ) is definitely different . it's worth trying if not replacing fruit flavored soda entirely . 
=================
can irritate pets' eyes ; advertising misleading i ordered it with the intention of using it on the garden of my daughter in law while visiting my son this summer . she has complained about chipmunks eating her flowers and this seemed to be a good way to deal with the problem . initially she was very enthused about testing this product , especially after i showed her on the amazon description that it could be safely used around pets : " safe for use around children and petsmade from all - natural ingredients , critter ridder is organic materials review institute ( omri ) listed and usda approved for use in organic gardening . because it's epa - registered , parents can feel confident using critter ridder around their children and pets . " however when she read the fine print and discovered this " precautionary statement " she declined to give it a try : " hazards to humans and domestic animals . caution : causes moderate eye irritation . " if there is anything that my daughter in law enjoys more than her garden , it is her 2 cats . the possibility of causing discomfort to her " children " or somebody else's dog or cat was enough to deter her from using this product . the product may be very effective , but the advertising in misleading . i'm sure there are many other pet lovers with gardens that would like a product that deters pests but does not harm pets . they shouldn't be assured it was safe for pets then find otherwise in fine print after making the purchase .

makes your hair fall out . . . i had seen the commercials on tv and thought since i have naturally fine un - treated blonde hair i would give it a try . within one month my hair was falling out . not just a little , a lot . hairbrush full , shower , or just falling out . thought it might be thryoid , hormones or something else . went to the doctor and had all blood work done . everything fine ! i read comments for all brands of clear on amazon , found a lot of people were having the same issues . . . . quit using the shampoo and went back to pantene . within 2 weeks , my hair was slowing down in falling out . within 3 weeks , much to none was falling out . called the manufacturer and complained . they said this was unusual . . . i advised them to check customers comments on amazon . they offered to send me coupons for free porducts . . . if you want to give this shampoo a try , good luck . if your hair starts to fall out , remember this comment . it makes your hair fall out . 
=================
same as retail this is the same price per pound i can get at whole foods or giant . the suggested retail in no way matches retail pricing . i can get better pricing on other online sites . i can find this item cheaper at the discount retail stores in my area . why have online stores matched retail brick and block stores ? $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ 
=================
great . . . but packaging is a greasy mess product tastes good enough . . . but when it arrived it was a greasy mess - - with the cardboard box even showing the grease leak . i think each bar is leaking . amazon was nice enough to refund the cost however . i think the can might be a better bet . i've noticed , all my local grocery stores only stock the can . perhaps for the reason i experienced .

hands down best popcorn you can get outside of a theater i often wonder if i am the only person in the world who cannot stand microwave popcorn . give me real corn and a little oil and i am pretty happy . then i discovered this popcorn at a kitchen store in my local outlet . then they went out of business and i lost my awesome popcorn connection . . . until now . wabash valley farms is the best popcorn you can get outside of your local multi - plex ( though i really like target popcorn too ) . you don't need the whirly popper as indicated on the package instructions - i always cook it on the stovetop in a large covered pot ; my sister cooks it in one of those fancy carnival poppers . each pack contains 5 pouches of product . each pouch contains popping oil , popcorn , and a buttery salt topping ( which i only use about half of - it is very fine and very salty ) . for those that like additional butter , you can add it after popping . while i cannot attest to the exact amount of popcorn yielded , it does do a good job of filling up my 32 - cup tupperware thatsa bowl . thatsalotta popcorn . the unit cost is $ 1 . 66 per pouch , which may seem high when comparing it to microwave popping corn , but you just cannot compare the quality and taste ( and when compared to theater popcorn , it is a fraction of the cost ) . orville redenbacher has nothing on wabash ! 
=================
bar count went from 10 to 8 ! ! ! these granola bars are the best out there , however , quaker and amazon pulled a fast one on me . i subscribe and save to these because honestly i eat 12 boxes in about a week and a half . however , quaker changed the number of bars in a pack from 10 to now only 8 ! same price yet 2 fewer bars per pack . now with this order i'm basically getting 2 less boxes each time for the same price . amazon should have at least warned me that my 10 - count 12 pack order was now an 8 - count 12 pack order and that i would be paying the same price . i guess its back to buying the variety pack at costco with 60 bars , the downside being the dreadful oatmeal raisin bars i am inevitably forced to eat . actually the oatmeal raisin are pretty good , just not at all compared to the chocolate chip peanut butter .

does not taste like dates i love dates . i eat them when i want something sweet and i bake with them . i have bought other brands of chopped dates countless times . i bought a 4 pack of these and i do not like them . i like many of the products this manf makes . with prechopped dates normally the first flavor is sweet , then the date taste kicks in . with these the first flavor is oat , they are hardley sweet and have almost no date flavor . the limited flavor they will add are not worth the extra calories ( dates are high in sugar so 1 / 3 cup has 130 calories ) . these chopped dates are coated in oat flour so they do not stick . other manf use some sort of sugar . the oat seemed like a great idea . i planned on baking cookies and muffins with these so the oat taste would have been okay if there also was a sweet date taste . the very small amount of oat flour did not change the consistancy . maybe i just got a bad batch of no - flavor dates but i would expect the manf quality control to prevent something like this . before wasting money on 4 of these i suggest you buy a single bag to see if you like them . the 4 bags are well packed in a nice color printed carton .

get better quality tea for less $ $ ! lipton does taste good but it's not a good quality tea ! if you open the tea bag you'll see their not tea leaves but tea dust ( cheep ) . even the loos lipton tea is described as being " broken down so you need a fine filter to strain it . " when you steep good tea it should unfurl and look like spinach ! they say this tea comes to $ 0 . 57 an oz ? ! ? ! ? ! lets do the math . $ 27 . 54 devided by 8oz = $ 3 . 44 . i buy my tea from set to a tea [ . . . ] ) . it's really good tea with flavoring and dried fruit pices . it comes to $ 3 an oz for a tin or $ 2 . 57 for a refill . weather you buy it loose or in bags you get the same quality tea ! i went to a tea party last year ( like a tupperware party but more fun ) where the chick told us all about the different kinds of tea and gave us samples .

great product but why has the price doubled ? i love this offering from coffee people . it is rich and bold , just the way i like my coffee . but i was shocked to find the price has almost doubled in just a few weeks . what's going on ? at $ 1 . 00 per cup it's no longer worth the price . i'll go for their jet fuel coffee at $ 0 . 60 .

2nd order went awry well i bought this item before and enjoyed it immensely . pink salmon is very good for you . this time i ordered again , received albacore tuna instead of pink salmon . amazon does not do returns on groceries such as these , even if not opened that i can see . i sent personally an email to raincoast trading company based in canada , also left a phone message as well . delayed response , but finally got emails and they were courteous but they redirected me to try help center to get credit and get the correct item . gone through hoops in the help center of amazon to no avail . until i found the toll free amazon phone number , amazon llc confirmed they can not accept the return , but will send the correct item promptly . we shall see , awaiting a replacement item . a minor complaint they are smaller can sizes than the normal pink salmon i am used to ordering . anyone want some tuna ? o well . p . s . updated review sept 30th 2009 , i finally got the ordered item , partly because the amazon rep corrected it when i called in and sent it fast ! btw , it cost me a toll call to canada to the company without a prompt reply . that just added insult to injury . well i was able to order from a different merchant through amazon . thank you amazon for coming through : )

product great - pricing is wrong the castor & pollux veggie 3 - pack is a great item . my cats love it . however , the pricing is way off . c & p sell this item for $ 7 . 49 , so at this price i expected three 3 - packs , but only got one . amazon agreed to credit my account . if the pricing still says $ 19 . 42 , you are better off going directly to c & p .

marzipan made with corn syrup isn't up to snuff i ordered this marzipan last christmas , amazed by the great deal that i had found . unfortunately , the old addage is true : you get what you pay for . this marzipan is made with corn syrup instead of sugar , has a low almond content , and is flavored with a hint of citrus that masks any almond flavor whatsoever . i may as well have been eating lemon - scented glue sticks . even more interesting is that i froze the unused marzipan in the same bag with a 'better' variety . within three months this marzipan had taken on a freezer taste , whereas the higher grade marzipan still tastes great even one year later . they were both in the same bag together , so it can only be the ingredients themselves that didn't hold up . i will never buy cheap marzipan again , and i have thrown out the bulk marzipan that i purchased from this company .

new senseo pods i just tried the new vienna ( hazelnut flavored ) senseo pods . i'm not a big flavored coffee drinker , but i just wanted to try something different . it's a really nice cup of coffee . the flavor isn't too strong - which i like . i also like the combination of the different flavors ( hazelnut , chocolate , etc . ) . i had tried the folgers flavors but they are way too artifical tasting - can't hardly taste the coffee . if you want to try somthing differnet in your senseo machines , you should check these out .

disappointed when i was a kid , a very long time ago , we ate a lot of spam . my mother worked . spam was great . cold it made a good sandwich , fried , even better . i recently bought a can after not tasting it for many years . i was a little surprised how watery , greasy and just plain nasty it was . i tried frying a piece and it almost disappeared . i gave it 2 stars only because i figured hormel had to meet a price point and this was the best they could do . i find it funny and sad how many people think this crap actually tastes good . shows how our standards has fallen over the years .

only 1 minute of chewing this chew in the " wolf - size " lasted my 22lb dog about a minute . he easily broke the bone into large chunks and swallowed them . i would not recommend these as a long lasting treat though they are apparently tasty . bully sticks last much longer for him and might be a good alternative to these because they are also easier to digest than rawhide treats . 
=================
tasty but gritty if you're thinking of the regular graham crackers of old , get that image out of your mind . first of all , these new crackers are much tastier . second , they have a gritty texture that some may like and some may not , probably due to the oat flakes in them . third , they hold up even better when you dip them into milk . just remember , while these golden honey crackers are whole grain , they are not organic . two full cracker sheets are 110 calories , not too bad if you can stop there . now where's the peanut butter ?

too light i am a darker coffee person so this is too light of a coffee . its more of a sweet breakfast blend . i like the flavor and its ok for a dessert coffee .

not the best for my cat i got this for my cat , thinking it was 'human grade' , grain free , hence good for my cat . i realized the marketing is aimed at human sensibilities because it certainly looks and smells good enough for 'people' food . it may be great for some cats , but mine gained 2 lb since she's been eating this and i was feeding her much less than suggested . she also developed urinary problems . my vet who is one of the few vets who have studied nutrition , tried calling weruva to find out more specifics about their food including calories , because many of her feline patients were eating weruva and gaining considerable weight . the staff at weruva would not talk to her or answer her questions and i couldn't guess why that would be unless their research has no real scientific backing to indicate this is a nutritious food . i tried calling them about week after that to see if they would tell me anything - - i got the same dismissive response . pet food is not regulated and these smaller manufacturers can get one vet to review their ingredients and pay them off to say - 'hey this is a great , human - grade , grain free food' . while i've read the positive reviews about this food and some obviously find their cats love it , if your cat is gaining weight or developing urinary problems while on weruva , think twice about buying it .

not bad not bad for a quick microwave meal . as to be expected from a korma , it really has no spice whatsoever . comes alive when adding your own peppers . it's not up to restaurant quality , but you could do a lot worse for 3 - 4 minutes of preparation .

i really wanted this to work . i really wanted to give them another try . first thing i must say is the cutover service is great . lillianna and nancy are very nice ( the fact that i know there names is redic ) . however , as much as i wanted this product to work ! after my 2nd machine and my 3rd bowl i'm giving up . nancy asked for another shot ( this is not the first time she's asked ) but this time i declined . i wanted to give them a shot i really did but there have been way to many errors , so i thought you all should know . i am a big review person so i had to put this out there . we bought our machine directly from their site . first machine out of the box tiny plastic piece on bowl lid broken . get a new bowl . finally get to use the machine , water leaks everywhere and after steaming no blending happening . a new machine arrived . 1st use - steam but no blend again , but no water yay lol . i gave it another shot , worked good . yesterday , couldn't get my blade off and drive shaft was stuck . now , at this point i have 3 bowls sitting around - but i was just tired of this machine . read this part @ least : this machine has a great concept , steam and blend all in one without going back to hit another button - perfect , i thought , until i got the manual . there is actually only about 5 foods that you can actually do this with ! ! ! ( i wish i would have known this ) all the others have water issues . so for instance , i think it was apples , they have too much water after steaming so you have to go and strain the water before blending . . . so whats the point ? along with this when you blend manually you have to stand there and hold the button in ! i've decided i'm not that lazy and i can go back and hit a steam button - but i am a multitasked so standing over the machine to hold the button in , well , sucks ! taking it apart and getting the blade out is rather difficult ( and as u can see from above sometimes the darn thing doesn't even come out ) . my mind always slipped and i wanted to get my food out of the bowl - but to take the blade out it needs to be attached to the base , so i would have to put it back on and get the blade out . also , difficult to put the bowl back on the base @ times . the gaskets have to be lined up or there is no luck . i am using filtered water and i am still getting mineral deposits in the water tank after first use , hmmm ? overall , too many flaws , too many manufacturing errors , time to buy a beaba . sorry breeza , i wanted to love you .

double the price welli have been using this for quite a while and even though the place where i shop the prices are exorbitant , this vendor's prices are more than double what i pay for it on the retail shelf ( i get it for . 46 cents a pack ) i certainly don't understand how people can afford to pay such dishonest pricing .

great price for 6 boxes , but . . . . . . . . we bought them for our german shepherd and golden retriever , very good price , but the dogs won't eat them everytime , theywill put them in their mouths , but then spit them out andsometimes come back later and eat them . i guess it depends onhow hungry they are . we give them to a local stray and sheeats them , but i think she's hungry a lot . we won't get themagain , it'll take awhile to get rid of the remaining 5 boxes .

brm vs pamelas i feel bad for alot of other gf bread / baking flour makers because if more people discover the goodness of pamela bread mix they would go out of business . my sister and i are celiac and believe me we tried it all . we tried baking our own to purchasing about every different mix we could find and it came down to pamelas or brm because they are more readily available at local grocery stores . let me tell you pamela blows them all away . i've had family member and co - workers ( who by this time were pretty scared of taste testing my gf baked goods ) completly surprised some even said they preferred over wheat varieties . the sweet bread recipe taste almost like a moist potato bread . sorry brm
=================
cardboard after taste , lots of ingredients i do not eat a lot of crackers because of all the partially hydrogenated crap in them , but i purchased these for a party thinking they might be slightly healthier than normal crackers - i was wrong . although there are " real " vegetables in the ingredients list , they are very far down on the list . additionally the vegetables in the crackers are part of a " dehydrated vegetable blend " and the vitamins you would expect to be in many of the vegetables ( eg vitamin a in the carrots listed in the vegetable ) are not much higher than in normal crackers . questionable marketing and name aside , the crackers don't taste very good . i could barely taste a hint of onion and pepper , and none of the other vegetables listed on the crackers - i am guessing i tasted the onion only because onion powder is also listed as an ingredient . they have a strong wheat taste , which i thought was surprising since it lists enriched flour as the main ingredient . additionally they had a very distinct cardboard taste once you have chewed them a few times . i will not be buying these again and i would not recommend them to anyone . ingredients i got off the box : enriched flour ( wheat flour , niacin , reduced iron , thiamine , mononitrate { vitamin b1 } , riobflavin { vitamin b2 } , folic acid ) , soybean and / or palm and / or palm kernel and / or canola and . or partially hydrogenated cottonseed oil , dehydrated vegetable bled ( contains carrots , onions celery , cabbage , red bell pepper , tomato , parsley ) , sugar , baking soda , high fructose corn syrup , onion powder , ( flavor enhancer ) , natural flavor , artificial color , disodium guanylate ( flavor enhancer ) .

peanut and tree nut allergy sufferers beware i can't say anything about the quality , taste , texture , touch , smell , substance or general quality of this product . unfortunately , i found out only after ordering and receiving this product that it was " manufactured in a facility that uses tree nuts and soy . " while i appreciate the fact that the manufacturers mention this on the packaging , it would have helped me greatly to have this information noted on the product information page . i just now checked the amazon page again and there is no mention of this incredibly important information . for those of you without family members that suffer from peanut and tree nut allergies , go for it , but for the many of us that do live with these challenges , steer clear of this product . i would also hesitate to purchase any other products from this manufacturer without first verifying with them that product was not manufactured in a facility that uses tree nuts . ! ! ! wait ! ! just checked their website and there's not a single reference to allergens ( other than gluten ) in their products . actually , they seem to have a rather ample offering of products of gluten - free goods , but this does little for those with other allergies . lastly , i don't expect every product to be free of peanuts and tree nuts , but i do expect the manufacturer to make it known to me if they have these ingredients in their products or are using a facility where these ingredients are used in other products . unfortunately , bob's red mill has done neither for their website or for their product page on amazon . while i could return the product in another box ( original one was already thrown out ) , it is too much trouble / hassle to do so . thanks bob ! !

ordered tip - 500 , they shipped tip - 400 i ordered this product for my mom . she was looking for flour tip - 500 but could not find it anywhere else than on amazon . well , i was very happy to get it for her but was disappointed when i received the package . what was shipped is tip - 400 and not tip - 500 as shown on the picture . i did contact the seller and asked him about it and they said that sometimes ingredients can be different than shown on the picture . well , this is not a question of ingredients but a totally different product . after a few emails back and forth and after i had to contact amazon the funds were refunded .

currently cleaning up puke ! these were on discount so i figured why not try them being that my dog's mouth smells like his other end if you know what i mean . after two days of giving him 1 chew a day , he started vomitting everywhere . it has to be these chews as we haven't given him anything else new lately and he rarely ever vomits . i think i will be sticking with greenies from now on .

good , but too sweet i like the high protein / fiber and low calories . but this was way too sweet . i had to double the amount of recommended water to be able to drink this . i have also tried the iced tea and pink lemonade . i like the pink lemonade best and this one the least . overall , the product is not bad . it dissolves completely and does not have aftertaste . give it a try . but before buying a bunch of one single flavor , try them all first .

extremely disappointed i love spicy food , and i add hot sauce to almost everything i eat , but this hot sauce a completely disappointment . the name itself is b . . . s . . . , i have tasted more spicy hot sauce than this . just for anyone interested , the main ingredients as indicated on the bottle are : red habaneros , hot pepper extract , red chiles . however , all i tasted was black pepper , not even a hint of habaneros . it's 2nd worst hot sauce for me ( tabasco is # 1 because it is a sour sauce , nothing hot about it ) , because it reminded me of the cheap instant noodle soup bowl ( black pepper beef flavor noodle soup ) that i used to eat when i was a child . no taste , no flavor , and no aroma . no tonge numbing , no throat burning , and no stomach twisting . just plain dull heat and cheap taste . well , money well wasted . by the way , i used 6 drops on my one bowl of steam rice , and the heat didn't even last 5 minutes . the bottome line is : this is not a hot sauce for spicy food lover . a good hot sauce makes food tasty with aroma and flavor , this one doesn't . it's like i can make the sweetest cake for you by loading it with tons of sugars , is it sweet ? of course , but is it a good tasty cake ? you tell me . 
=================
wouldn't use any other whipped topping why would anyone use whipped cream from the frozen food section that's made from nothing but sugar when you can use this absolutely wonderful topping made from nuts ?

one of the boxes i received had only 17 bars in it , not 24 i placed an order for multiple boxes of this item . when i opened the first box , i immediately noticed the bars were all jumbled up , with obvious voids in the box . i took the bars out and counted them , and there were only 17 , not 24 as was indicated on the box and on the amazon website . i weighed the box and it weighed considerably less than the other boxes . i opened one more box , and it did have all 24 . i guess the machine packing it malfunctioned , but it should have been weighed and the discrepancy caught before being shipped from the company , imho .

goji berries , huh ? this is my first time trying goji berries , so unfortunately i can't speak for the quality of this product compared to others . i can say that the product arrived fast , well - packaged , and that all the berries are bright orange with no sign of mold / spots / nastiness so far . that's probably a good sign . ; ) i'm not really wow - ed by these , though . i mean , they're little dried orange berries . not a lot of flavor , especially when pre - soaked . they're aight , i guess . i might experiment with a couple other brands to gain perspective , but maybe some things aren't meant to be dried out and shipped halfway around the world . no complaints with the condition or quality of the product itself , though .

only for the desperate i'd keep these on hand for emergency food prep only , the exact situation we faced ( snowed in , couldn't get to store ) . luckily , we still had power during the snowstorm so we made the product as instructed . one tip here : remember that microwave ovens all cook at different temps and speeds , adjust cooking time accordingly . this should be gooey and not hard as a rock . we had two packages and had to test one before finding the right cooking time . the taste : totally disappointing . while we all wanted a sweet treat , this barely met our needs , providing only calories and some energy , making me qualify it as suitable for " emergencies only " . as far as providing a taste of sweetness , yes , this was fine . however , it fell far short of the " warm delight " promised by the cover photo and title . there was a decided hint of preservatives and some unpleasant flavors , creating an unsatisfactory culinary experience . no one expects a microwave mix to be high cuisine but this was barely palatable . we don't have gourmet standards by any means but this was not liked by anyone in the family , although the adults managed to eat our portions . the kids ? forget it . however , although i couldn't find them here , we did try some mixes during the snowstorm that exceeded our expectations . one was better homes and gardens chocolate chip mix . if you can find it , get it . it not only came in a lovely container but included the bonus of a year's subscription to bh & gardens for only $ 5 . 00 , a bargain rate ( optional , not required to subscribe to buy mix ) . the mix in container cost $ 5 . 99 so we felt this was a better use of our money , leaving us with a reusable and microwavable container and tasty cookies for the $ 5 . 99 . if we wanted , we had a monthly magazine for another $ 5 . 00 . you do the math and conduct a taste test and i think you'll agree that " warm delights " aren't so delightful . just a thought .

still waiting . . . i ordered this product oct 1st and it is almost november 3rd and still i have not received this item . it has been a full month . what is the hold up ? ?

gets really old . . . pretty quickly i tend to love spicy noodles of all kinds . i go more for the stove top , than hot water in a vat variety . the first time i tried it , i thought it was okay and i really wanted to love these noodles because it's lower in calories than my go to shin ramyun , but i just couldn't love it . i dreaded eating the noodles again because i felt as though it tasted like plastic . i am definitely not ordering this again . i still have a number left from the pack that i bought . i would recommend trying one before buying a whole box .

better coffee from a can there's no denying the senseo is easy to use , and 'greener' than any of the other pod brewers out there . but the dark roast coffee was stale and dry , with the same aroma and flavor of a canned coffee that's been left sitting out too long . a pod brew will never be as good as drip - i get that . but that won't stop me from looking for something close . if you want easy and are not picky about taste , this pod's for you . if you want a pod brew that is at all reminiscent of a decent cup of coffeehouse java , keep looking .

i hated it , but mom loved it . i thought this cereal was terrible . it has a very odd aftertaste , and to be honest , this is what i would imagine balled up pieces of paper soaked in milk would taste like . very " cardboard - like . " it also has that really strange , fake vanilla - like taste that a lot of the ultra - healthy and " organic " cereals have . for me , this is just further proof that these " healthy " cereals taste awful . i'll stick to the cheerios and special k , thanks ! that being said , i'm still giving this two stars because my mom loved it . don't ask me why , because lord knows i have no idea , but she thought it was great . when i asked her what exactly she liked about it , she state that she enjoyed the taste and the crunchiness . she thought the vanilla flavoring was good , and was surprised that i didn't like it as she felt it was very " true to taste . " she also liked that it had so many healthy things in it , i . e . flax . she thought that for a " healthy " cereal , it was very tasty . i guess all things considered it just depends on your personal taste . i mean , it's food . what one person loves another person dislikes . like i said , i thought it tasted like rolled up pieces of paper soaked in milk into which someone poured an artificial vanilla flavoring . she , on the other hand , found it tasty , crunchy , satisfying , and overall delicious . to each his own , i suppose . i personally won't be rebuying this one .

ok stock . . . . really disappointing on fixens . i picked up a pouch of this soup at a local market just recently . i have always loved a good minestrone soup and make it home made a lot . however like many others at times i like to keep it quick and easy , and a ready in no time bag of stock and fixens often fits the bill nicely . unfortunately this soup was quick and easy all right , but that is pretty much where most of the goodness of it ended . the recipe calls for 6 cups of water plus a 15oz can of tomato sauce . i opted for only 5 cups of water since i prefer a thicker , heartier soup . but as i mixed it all together it was obvious as it simmered that this was going to be a really loose watery soup , even with using less water than directed . oh , the pouch has a nice list of ingredients on it , including pasta , bell pepper , onion , celery , etc , but both the size and quantity of them all leaves much to be desired . the stock itself was not bad . it was not overly salty , was mildly spicy and tasted passable enough . but with every spoonful that's pretty much what you got every time . a lot of stock with a few pitiful pieces of fixens floating around in it . . . like all soup mixes , the pouch recommends some stir in suggestions . like sausage , hamburger , beans , and cabbage for example . but in my opinion if you want to enjoy a hearty soup for dinner on some cold night at all with this , plan on a stir in suggestion being not an option , but a must . and even then i suggest you use less than the 6 cups of water suggested . an even more sensible option is to forget this entirely and opt for a much better choice for a pouch style soup mix in the bear creek brand minestrone . available here on amazon , and in lots of local markets . its decently hearty all by itself , and is superior with some meat or other suggestion tossed in . and you even get more stock and fixens for about the same price as this cuginos brand . all in all i cannot recommend this mix . either try the bear creek or other mix , or go home made . . . : )

be careful of the tomatoes our 15mo old daughter has really liked most of the other happy baby foods ( she loves the gobble - gobble & mango - spinach - pear ) . however , this one makes her throw up every time ! she is not allergic to anything in the ingredients - i can only guess that the high tomato content is just too acidic for her tummy . 
=================
these are not organic while earth's best produces great organic products for kids , these use some but not all organic ingredients . all earth's best products that are organic will have that word below their logo , this does not . we were disappointed to see these marketed as organic on this website but then noticed the legal disclaimer that amazon will not be held responsible if the information on the site does not accurately describe the product . if you are looking for good , healthy cereal bars for kids , these are an excellent choice . but if you want a 100 % organic cereal bar , keep shopping .

good unfortunately i really dislike drinking water so this is a good way to " get my water intake " in . . . i guess haha . i drink a lot since purchasing these . i have noticed a weird aftertaste with some of the flavors but it ` s not too strong to the point i can't drink it . i ` d buy it again but i ` d probably stick with the lemon flavor .

taste ok . the name is misleading . these pasta shells of of good , not great quality . as long as price remains reasonable , they are worth the money . main problem is the label and amazon ( who relied on the copy from the manufacturer ) , says " large shells " . these can only be called " small " . so if you need large , for whatever reason , do not buy these . get " primo pasta " brand large shells . they are large and superb ( but more expensive ) .

teeccino herbal drink the taste of teeccino caffeine - free herbal coffee mediaterranean almond amaretto is not the kind of taste i was looking for . i love the taste of coffee with no flavors added , but someone recommended this to me , so i tried it . my goal was to find something i could replace coffee with for a warm drink in the morning . but this is not it . i guess if you like the taste of almond you will like it . but i thought it was going to be a mild flavor . oh well back to real coffee until i can find something different .

good value and fresh , wonderful smelling spice ! this cinnamon by frontier is a very good value for the money , especially if you don't mind buying in bulk . the cinnamon has a fresh and wonderful taste and smell . much better than any supermarket stuff . i keep the cinnamon fresh by putting it into freezer ziplock bags and freezing it . it's easy to take out of the freezer and use right from the bag , no thawing needed . as stated by a few other reviewers , this cinnamon is from cassia and according to wikipedia the " cinnamon " we get here isn't " true cinnamon " and it contains coumarin which is bad for your liver and kidneys at least . it's ok in small amounts and most people would never use a lot in their cooking that would do harm . according to the web site " spice page " you can eat up to one gram without getting the coumarin poisoning . please research this for yourself ! so this cinnamon is not for people that take it for diabetes / sugar metabolism and other health benefits . use this type only for use as a spice in your recipes or to sprinkle on food for added flavor . frontier does sell the more expensive cinnamon that is good and beneficial to you . it's called ceylon cinnamon , and it's the real deal . so if money is not an issue , or you are very concerned about your health and possible coumarin poisoning , please do not buy this type and go for the ceylon cinnamon .

gf arrowroot bread recipe this flour makes the 'best' gluten - free bread in the world . here is my recipe which is a variation on betty hagman's recipe : arrowroot ( or corn flour ) bread ' * 1 cup arrowroot flour * 1 / 3 cup parmesan cheese * 2 tablespoons brown sugar * 1 cup cornstarch * 2 / 3 cup potato starch * 1 / 3 cup tapioca flour * 2 1 / 2 teaspoons xanthan gum * 1 1 / 2 teaspoon salt * 1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin * 1 / 2 cup dry milk or nondairy substitute * 1 large egg * 1 teaspoon cider vinegar ( non - gluten ) * 1 / 4 cup vegetable oil ( i use spanish olive oil ) * 3 tablespoons honey * 1 1 / 2 cups water ( scant , at temperature suggested by your breadmaker manual ) * 2 1 / 4 teaspoons ( 1 packet ) dry yeast'' * in a medium bowl , combine flours , starches , potato buds , parmesan cheese , brown sugar , xanthan gum , salt , gelatin and dry milk . * in another bowl , beat the egg slightly and add the vinegar , oil , water , honey . * * place in your bread machine in order suggested in the manual . add the yeast to the dry ingredients as directed in your manual . * * set on white bread with medium crust . well worth the cost . far better for those of us that suffer from bowel disease . i am a sufferer of ulcerative colitis and crohn's disease . the bean flours , sorghum , millet and flax seed meal all send me into horrible flares or give me terrible discomfort . this is the only one i can tolerate . betty hagman saved us all .

great , daily sencha the title really says it all - if you enjoy brewing tea and drink it daily , this is a great everyday sencha . it has a good , clean flavor you can only get from a full leaf tea like this . now - a thing or two about rishi's actual brewing instructions . this is the second rishi tea i've tried , and like the first , the quality is great and i've been thoroughly enjoying it . if you follow rishi's brewing instructions , however , you will get an overly potent , undrinkable mess instead of the mild , subtle yet undeniable flavor of a properly brewed green tea . green tea isn't supposed to taste like the crap you get at panera or from lipton - you're not supposed to be assaulted by intense flavor when you drink it . if you follow rishi's instructions though , that is what will happen and you'll probably end up writing reviews about how it tastes like grass . 1 tablespoon per 8 ounces of water is beyond overkill . brewing that for 3 - 4 minutes is even greater overkill . like most other full leaf greens , 1 teaspoon per 8 ounces of water brewed for between 1 . 5 to 2 . 5 minutes is what the brewing instructions on this tea should be . if i were to put 3 tablespoons of this stuff in my tetsubin and brew it for 4 minutes . . . i don't even want to know what would come out of the spout . so , 1 teaspoon / 8 ounces of water for 1 . 5 - 2 . 5 minutes ( 2 . 5 is even pushing it ) and you'll get an amazing green tea that has the subtlety and smoothness that you're supposed to get out of a green like this . if it's bitter or you feel like you're on a green tea roller coaster , you've brewed it wrong .

read the instructions so i thought fresh meant i could eat it out of the box , much like i would fresh apples and pears . apparently not . after devouring three pounds of fresh whole rabbit out of the box , i have spent the last week in the hospital . be sure to read the instructions . apparently you have to cook the rabbit .

contains " natural fruit flavors " , which means ? updated i was going to buy , then checked the ingredients at their website . natural fruit flavors is one of the ingredients , unfortunately . google " natural flavors msg " , and wonder if the flavoring they add is high in free glutamic acid . maybe , maybe not , who knows ? i won't buy smooze unless they remove this . i'll give a neutral 3 star rating and change if i hear back from the company . here's the email i received : hi , sorry for the delay to response because we are waiting answer from the maker . they contain the natural fruit itself and traces of vanilla , carrot and cinnamon . thanksjcsmoozeusaso i'll add a star , and order some !

hartland waffles i have not yet been able to produce a waffle we can eat using this mix . the dough sticks to the waffle iron and then separates . i called heartland and was told that their waffle conditioner ( which is called for in the directions ) is for their commercial customers . i have been unable to locate a waffle " conditioner " locally - or anywhere else . the bag does warn that nonstick sprays will cause the waffles to stick - they do ! ! ! ! also the pack of 6 makes way more waffles than a family of two needs . heartland said the shelf life is 6 months - a year if frozen . we liked the waffles so much when we had them for breakfast in a hotel while we were travelling that we wanted to enjoy them at home . we inquired and were told how to get the mix . serve was quick , heartland was pleasant to deal with . anyone have a suggestion or experience with this mix ? guess i'm back to " scratch " waffles .

tasty , but not healthy for kids with 29g of sugar horizon vanilla milk is like drinking a coke from a cow . just because something is " organic " doesn't make it healthy . 1 cup of whole milk has 12 grams sugar , while 1 cup of horizon vanilla 2 % milk has more than twice that - 29 grams of sugar ! plus horizon vanilla milk has 180 calories vs 150 for whole and 120 for 2 % milk . two cartons of this stuff is an entire meals worth of calories .

buyer beware make sure when you shop for kopi luwak that you are getting the actual 100 % kopi . there are a number of blends out there that sport a whopping 2 % or 3 % of kopi beans mixed with something else . the true kopi has a remarkable smokey , silky character with a wonderful caramel finish that coats your mouth long after swallowing . i just shared some with my veteran coffee roaster ( his first taste ) and he remarked that it was the best coffee he had tasted since the old kona before the quality dropped in the early 90's . real kopi should be treated like gold and with respect by : using a burr grinder on the fine side of medium grind ; making a single cup at a time ; and using water at about 190f ( boil filtered water and let it sit for 1 minute ) . wet the grounds ( about 2 standard coffee measuring scoops ) with a little water at first , then pour just enough for one 8 oz . cup . btw i discovered you can reuse the grounds from this process one more time with only a little reduction in quality if you make the second cup right away . you can stretch your kopi dollars this way since you are spending about 7 $ a cup .

oh my . . . . i like the taste of the tea but it is very hard on my digestive system ! i have tried it twice now ( for several days ) and it completely upsets the balance , won't go into detail but you get the picture ! as soon as i stop drinking it ( 2c . a day , 1 in the morning and 1 in the evening ) i am fine . there must be something in it that i cannot tolerate . i bought the case . . . . i never have trouble with any other tea ! : (

low carb crackers i ordered these elsewhere because i didn't want to be stuck with several packages in case i didn't like them . if you're doing atkins or another low carb plan and have been missing crunchy crackers , this may be just what you're looking for . the taste is not bad but as other reviewers have mentioned , these crispbreads are extremely dry . you have got to put something on them - butter , cream cheese , jam , anything and you should have a beverage with them too . if you consider them to be a vehicle for great toppings , i don't think you'll be disappointed . low calorie , 2 net carbs per slice , plenty of fiber and crunch . what's not to like ?

used to be wonderful ! i have been buying this tea for a couple years , it was lovely ( hot or cold ) until they changed the formula and added cinnamon . while i enjoy cinnamon in many tea formulas , it is not an asset here at all ! as far as this household is concerned the cinnamon muddies the flavor , ruining the fruit / flower flavor that made it such a pleasure . this significant change was not listed on the ingredients ( as of may 2012 ) . we will not order this again until they come to their senses and change it back .

wife says not as good . . . my wife doesn't like these as much as another brand we ordered from amazon previously . she says they are firmer and " bland . " to me , they taste just fine , and an unsalted , untoasted sunflower seed is , well , expected maybe to be somewhat bland , perhaps ? a seed with a little crunch is fine by me , and we'll buy these in bulk again if the price is right since finding shelled , unsalted seeds ( which is what we want ) locally is impossible .

yomogi & red bean mochi sampler the items arrived perfectly on time , however the yomogi & red bean mochi sampler product was clearly past expiration date . the mochi were cracked and dry , they didn't have the correct gummy texture that mochi have and the taste , although not bad , was poor . the japanese green tea mochi , however , are perfectly fine , soft and plump . i believe a company that sells out these delicate items should check that they are in perfect conditions before selling the products , also because due to amazon policy grocery items cannot be returned , even if defective as is apparent in this case .

it's not pomegranate juice and tastes bitter i've enjoyed izze drinks in the past and for the past year and a half have been drinking pomegranate juice whenever i get the chance . when i learned about izze's fortified all natural sparkling pomegranate juice , i was rather excited at the prospect of tasting some . i was rather disappointed . to begin with , even though this product is labeled as pomegranate juice , it's a misnomer because this is not real pomegranate juice . instead it's a hybrid containing juices from concentrates of apples , white grapes , pineapples , lemons , cranberries , pomegranates , and a few other added vitamins . the other vitamins don't bother me so much , but when a product is labeled and marketed as pomegranate juice , that's what a person should expect to get , not a mixture of a bunch of juices only one of which is pomegranate . besides the false labeling , the drink is quite bitter and hard to drink . drinking the beverage straight from the cans doesn't quite cut it ( it tastes a bit metallic ) and i've had to pour the stuff in a glass with ice . perhaps the absorption of the ice takes away part of the bitterness , but i've found the drink tastes much better this way . but , overall , you'd best just avoid buying the stuff altogether .

tastes bad i can't speak of the benefits yet , but i'll comment on the taste . it doesn't really taste like ginger , it tastes like the spiciness left behind after you've eaten a sliver of it . it doesn't taste good , it's drinkable , but not pleasant . it's really spicy . all i taste is spice . it's not " strong " per say though . it also has stevia in it , and i can taste it , and i hate stevia . leaves a bad aftertaste . i will only buy this again if i notice any benefits , but i'm only on my second cup .

'suggested retail' is way off . . . each pack is labeled to be $ 1 . 39 each individual package is clearly labeled to cost : $ 1 . 39 . last i checked , $ 1 . 39 * 24 = $ 33 . 36 , not the $ 52 . 80 that amazon has listed today . while the safety in naming an item a 'variety pack' lies in the potential of there being different combinations of 7 assorted flavors ; my package included 6 flavored coffees , and 1 non - flavored variety . 1 . mackinac island fudge2 . french vanilla3 . traverse city cherry4 . creme brulee5 . hazelnut6 . toasted maple nut7 . jamaican me crazythe nice thing about the paramount coffees is that each flavor is not over - powering . to give you an idea of what i mean : drinking them black you can taste the flavor ; with skim milk you get a hint of the flavor ; with cream and sugar , if you close your eyes and pretend real hard , you can sometimes guess which flavor it might be .

first one star ever sorry i have a 10 month old weimaraner that loved the regular busy bone chewbone threat so i thought i would give the chewnola dog treats a try thinking it would be even better . he took it right away when i gave it to him and chewed on it for about 2 minutes then left it alone . he will eat if it is the only choice he left it laying in the living room and went and got one of his rawhide bones . i gave it to him yesterday and you can barley tell he has eaten any . there is only a little granola missing . i am starting to think he scratched the granola off . i don't think he likes the texture of the granola because it is a little sharp . this morning he was soaking it in his water bowl then eating it and it looks like he likes it a little better now that it is slimy , softer , and less sharp . i will not be getting this type again i now have a sticky mess to clean up .

my cats didn't like it . . . my cats won't eat this food . i have been a wellness cat food user for more than a decade . ( i only feed the no - grain and no fish varieties . ) my current cats have eaten a lot of wellness , but they won't eat this . even so , i think wellness has some of the better cat foods on the market . one disappointment with wellness foods in general from my perspective ( not the cats' ) : is that they use guar gum and carageenan . they are considered to be gastrointestinal irritants . it is hard to find cat foods that don't use guar gum and carageenan . tiki cat is one vendor that offers such foods . weruva's paw lickin' chicken is another ( however , it didn't seem to agree with one of my cats ) . tiki cat and weruva's food look more appetizing than the new wellness line . by the way , i don't offer my cats fish - based foods as they seem to vomit when they get those . that further limits options . for further info , google lisa pierson , dvm . she has some very enlightening writings on pet food .

very disappointed - won't make the mistake again . . . i've been buying the art of appreciation gift baskets for years for my family members . the recipients were always grateful and seemed to have enjoyed the varieties . this year , i got curious and ordered myself a basket after sending several of the same out to my family and friends . upon receipt , i was shocked at the content and the presentation of the basket especially for the price paid . i could probably come up with a much better mix with less than $ 30 - in fact i will do so from now on . i feel embarrassed that this is the type of baskets i've been sending out year after year to my loved ones . don't be fooled that you'd impress anyone with the included caviar - it tastes like salty but unsweet flying fish eggs . as a person used to the caspian caviars and even some cheaper american paddlefish alternatives , i find it insulting and again very embarrassed to have sent the product as gifts . i should've known better . . . i called my sister ( yearly happy recipient ) and asked her if this is how it had been for years , and she giggled sheepishly and that's all i needed to know . received contents : 4 pieces ( 1 . 2 oz ) of belgian truffles3 . 5 oz dill salmon spread ( alaska smokehouse ) 3 . 75 oz pasteurized cheddar cheese ( northwood cheese co ) 0 . 95 oz mochaccino mix - enough for one 6oz cup2 oz smoked almonds ( los olivos ) 2 oz wine & cheese biscuits ( los olivos ) 1 . 8 oz chocolate dipped ( truffle ? ) cookies4 oz tuscan crackers ( focaccia crisps ) 2 oz water crackers ( three pepper blend ) 4 . 4 oz wafer rolls ( tiramisu flavor ) 5 oz pretzels ( typical salted dried ) 4 . 4 oz angelina's sweet butter cookies2 oz green olives , pimento stuffed ( mille lacs foods ) 2 oz black capelin caviar ( season brand ) missing items : 2 pakages cafe comfrorts white chocolate cocoa mixsesame crackersmerlot wine cheese - or is this for the pasteurized cheddar flavored dip ? stone ground mustardms . pinables caramel confections

pretty nasty tasting stuff coffee , is wifey and my favorite hobby we utilize most of the known ways of preparing it and we scour the net and shops for the perfect bean . i recognize that most of our likes come from what we grew up tasting and drinking , so our coffee tastes are compared to folgers or butternut , however we have made an effort to expand our coffee palettes over the years . that said i prepared the coffee using a vietnamese coffee filter system and it was not drinkable , i tried using the chemex system which usually yields a mild result and still no good . french press , nope . next step is a cold brew which often makes the worst and cheapest beans drinkable , if that doesnt work , i'll give the can to my brother in law , he will hate it but not admit it because he thinks he is a sophisticated drinker of exotic coffees i give him all my nasty beans . lol . i watched a program put on by illy on creating good beans ( actually my favorite espresso bean is lavazza super crema ) anyway they talked about a bean they called a 'stinker' thats a bean that if it finds its way into the blend will ruin the blend . i have found beans like that they have a cheezy smell to them . it could be possible that my can of trung nguyen had many 'stinkers' oh well , do keep in mind that when it comes to taste , whether its food , recipes , or coffee and its infinite varieties of preparation , what makes me gag , may be another persons absolute favorite . try it for yourself , one can wont break you , if you dont like it you could use it to sepia stain your black and white photographs or i'll give you the address of my brother in law .

before you buy a case . . . total bummer . my little pup doesn't like these 'lamb and sweet potato' tidbits at - all . and i have no idea why . i bought this recipe at the grocery store and everything on the package looked good . there's 9 % protein , a reasonable 4 % fat , with 11 % moisture and 4 % crude fiber . the approximately 1x1 inch tidbits ( about 1 / 4 inch thick ) are made with barley , lamb , sweet potatoes , with organic molasses ( yum ) and few other good things , and yet , i couldn't interest ms . charlene ( charlie ) in playing with one , much less eating one . she's a puppy - - russell / beagle mix - - so maybe she's picky or maybe she prefers something with more fat content , or with more smell - appeal . again i don't know , but i did want to write a review to warn you that you might want to buy a single bag versus a box full . two stars for excellent organic ingredients . no additional stars because my young pup wouldn't eat more than one tiny corner of one .

pretty dang bad in the last year or so i've really developed a taste for dark chocolate . i've liked dark chocolate for years but i started eating a bit more recently . i've tried several different brands from the store . all were at least good with some being a little better than others . so . while not scientific my personal taste experience says this dark chocolate bar taste terrible . if you are looking for that silky smooth deep rich dark chocolate flavor that sort of infuses your whole body starting with the tongue and culminating in a very pleasing feeling in your nogging look elsewhere . my god . on the other hand , if you are really into organics and go out of your way to eat all things organic then perhaps this is your chocolate bar . 54 % is not a very dark bar and i think it shows in the taste of this bar . the taste could also be due to the organic nature of the bar . that being the case , if you prefer that organic experience , that taste that organics typically have i don't think you'll be disappointed . for everyone else , the flavor is off with strange undertones . not inedible just not very tasty . the bars are fairly small at 2 . 25 ounces . that isn't really a knock since moderation in all things is a good habit .

great for the price but not so good quality . . . . . i purchased these bags because i was storing a lot and thought these were a great value . they are . these bags re easy to use , take 6 oz of milk , and have a double closure . and you can lay the bag flat in your freezer to allow to freeze as a small narrow package . all the attributes i love about this product . but ! ! ! ! ! for the third or fourth time now , when i thaw the frozen milk , the bags leak milk all over my fridge . this leak comes from the bottom corners of the bags - not the top seal . i have now learned to put the bag into a glass container , so it doesn't leak all over the fridge , but lost milk is lost milk .

tannic and bitter overpower the sweet i am glad for the chestnut growers that the bees are there to pollinate their trees , but i cannot say i like the resulting honey . the tannin and bitterness of this honey , not its power , are what i dislike ( i like a manuka , which has quite a powerful , rich breadth of flavors ) . but there you have it - i dislike it , and cannot recommend it , yet mr layka from new york adores it .

too bitter , not even close to starbucks store brewed cup i finally gave in and bought the starbucks house ( and breakfast ) blend k - cups ( from keurig's site ) . neither a like getting the same cup at starbucks . i realize it can't be exactly the same , k - cup vs large brewer . but , for me , the house blend is undrinkable - it's too bitter ( and i've tried brewing 3 different sizes , from smallest to travel mug ) . it's just bitter regardless , with no underlying complexity of flavor . won't be buying this again , even if it was less expensive . for comparison , i like tully's extra bold breakfast blend and tully's extra bold kona blend , both of which i brew on the 2nd cup size ( ~ 7oz ) . i've liked some other k - cups in the past , but they haven't been available on keurig's site for a while ( actually , the tully's kona isn't available on keurig , either . but the amazon price for that is so high ! ) . ( fyi - the starbucks breakfast blend is ok , i guess . but it doesn't have any of the complexity you taste in a cup from starbucks . so , to me , it's definitely not worth spending more on starbucks branded k - cups since i don't feel like i am getting anything close to the store brewed cup . actually , i don't like it as much as the tully's above , so wouldn't buy the starbucks bb even if it was the same price . ) hope this helps someone , since obviously taste is very subjective ! c -

too strong of flavors i love shrimp chips and i love healthier alternatives as well so i thought these would be a match made in heaven . not so much . the flavors were too strong most of the time ( i am a huge fan of pepper but even i had a hard time enjoying the salt & pepper flavor and the salt and vinegar made me shudder with each bite because of how strong the vinegar flavor is - - and this is from someone who currently lives in the uk and enjoys all types of vinegar crisps here ) and too bleh in others . the only flavors that my husband and i both liked were the bbq and sour cream and onion and we didn't enjoy them enough to want to buy these again . i wish these were as good as all the hoopla regarding them said but we still have 15 bags of these in our cabinet four months later uneaten so needless to say , i will be giving these away and avoiding them from now on .

beware ! not the same old frichik please be aware that the 'low fat' variety of this product is not the same as the standard 'frichik' . whatever is removed to be able to sport the 'low fat' moniker makes a world of difference . standard frichiks are delicious while the 'low fat' variety are drier and less tasty ( savory ) . i hope someone at amazon will take notice and start offering the standard frichik .

use the lid to drain is not great ok , so i like the fact that these are fresh noodles , no msgs and lower in sodium than other brands , but seriously the veggie pieces are so tiny that when you use the lid to drain , half of the veggies and sesame seeds will fall off into the sink and down the drain ! they did not really think their design through . the sauce is too spicy , this is not medium , it is rather hot . i can only tolerate half the content of the envelope .

braggs is good , price is not . i love braggs and use it daily on almost everything . great taste , works with veggies , tofu or meat , and tastes 1000 times better than soy sauce . however , this is $ 6 a bottle and use to be $ 5 a bottle here on amazon . $ 55 now for 3 ? i got the same 3 months ago with free shipping for $ 16 ! there is no reason for this to be priced so high !

my dog developed stones while on this diet my dogs love these kibbles as much as they love soft treats . however , one of my dogs , a 5 - year - old bichon , started passing many small stones in her urine while on this diet . i have since moved her to a diet of kirkland canned dog food and fresh home cooked chicken and rice . she has not had any new issues with stones .

warning - cans buckling ! i purchased and received a case of these 6 oz items mid - march - 2008 . i used two cans then and in reflection remember one of them spewing some paste when first pierced by the opener . tonight i've gone to open another can and this time it really projected out the paste when pierced with the opener . so i decide to check over the others and find 4 of them really bulging - each end pouched outwards a centimeter or so . and another 8 cans showing 1 to 3 mm bulges at each end ! this case has been in an a / c - ed home in a dark closet . the case of small cans appears to come from 3 different lot numbers ( opjcs 6 ashx24 1121 , opjcs 6 ashx24 1122 and opjcs 6 ashx24 1123 ) note the 1121 / 1122 / 1123 code differs . with just my visual inspection it appears all affected cans are 1122 but i will not be eating any of the remainders . i will be contacting the manufacturer asap to see if there has been a recall or known problem .

they go like hotcakes i manage the snack fund where i work and i go the extra step to have these imported . they sell wayyy too fast besides the jalapeno flavor . . . they taste like butt . i bought three boxes and they were gone within 5 days . . . besides the jalapeno flavor . . . they taste like butt .

hcg friendly - not pasta though ! think asian dishes ! ! i had read all the reviews on this product and realized people either hate these or love these noodles . so , i bought them . i'm on the hcg diet and everyone was talking about them . do you eat them in p2 or not ? there is a huge difference in opinion on that subject , but , i wanted to add something with a little substance about 2 weeks into p2 , so , bought them . i was afraid to open because so many had said there was a fish smell . but , there was none . still , i rinsed them for about 3 minutes in a collander under running water anyway just in case there was a strange taste . which there wasn't . they do look like pasta , but . . . . they are not pasta ! i would never mix them with pasta saucedo think asian dishes - put them in a brothy soup or stir fry ( p3 for the stir fry ) less is more ! they will " blob " up on you . you need to pull some strands out and add to your broth . just dumping them in won't work - they stay in a blob . taste is not pasta ! they tend to take on the flavors you are cooking them in . personally , i didn't feel they had any flavor , mainly just added substance to my soup . will i use them on round 2 of phase 2 again ? absolutely . they are filling . everyone warns that if you are using in p2 , just be careful . see how you react to them on the scale the next morning . some people do fine , others gain a pound . again , i would not make a meal out of them , especially the first time . maybe add a couple forkfuls and see how you like them , and , how the scale likes them . i think the negative reviews were from people that were looking for a pasta alternative . i cannot emphasize enough that there is no comparison to pasta - do not expect these to replace or taste anything like pasta ! you will be extremely disappointed .

simply the best mangosteen product ! i rarely take the time to write reviews but this product deserves the time . this is simply the best mangosteen product available . i have been a long time advocate of the mangosteen fruit and it's health benefits . i have been a long time sufferer of chronic tendonitis and severe arthritis from numerous surgeries on my ankle . this product does not solve all of my pain but daily use creates an extremely significant improvement ! the mangosteen juice allows me to function normally and with a noticeably reduced level of pain . this product is superior for 2 reasons . first the product consists of mangosteen whole fruit . the rind ( or pericarp ) is where the majority of the xanthones ( the main benefit of the fruit ) are found in the fruit . many companies exclude the pericarp because it doesn't taste as sweet as the rest of the fruit . " the genesis product contains 100 % wild harvested whole fruit including the thick tough and bitter inner and outside rind ( pericarp ) . other ingredients : none " the second reason which may not be as noticeable at first glance but thailand is notorious for it dangerous and harmful use of pesticides . pesticides are poison . if you already have health problems chances are that they're from ingesting toxins . many mangosteen products use fruit sprayed with these poison and don't tell you anything about it . my girlfriend sells one of these products ( which is how i originally became interested in the mangosteen fruit ) and is upset b / c i switched to the genisis brand . i told her that as soon as her company removed all of the additional apple juice and filler crap , provided information on exactly how much mangosteen juice is actually in the product , and provide information about the pesticides sprayed on the fruit they use , i would never switch back to a substandard product that may actually increase health problems rather than help .

not worth the money i would consider myself a caffeinated products connoisseur , so of course i've had 5 hour energy before . but it's not something that i'd consume on a regular basis . it's just ridiculously expensive compared to equally effective products . right now i'm taking black friday to cyber monday deal - 50 % off sale : the good morning pill 60 pill bottle energy pill supplement to increase focus , replace drinks , shots , coffee , which costs like 33 cents per pill , and gives me just as good ( or better ) energy boost than a ~ $ 2 5 hour energy . i've also taken isatori energize all day energy pill , tablets , 84 - count bottle in the past and also plain caffeine pills , and either one of those options would also be a fine substitute for 5 - hour . bottom line - if i get one for free i'll drink it , but why take a $ 2 shot instead of a 33 cent pill ? 
=================
very earthy flavor i mean earthy , like dirt . this tea is very woody , and earthy . there is no pear aroma , flavor , i don't know why it is even on the label . i don't hate it , but will find trouble trying to finish the 48 cups i bought . i think anyone who buys this must have tasted rooibos tea before . i love the organic part of this drink . i did not find this tea weak , the flavor is just bland , except for the slight woody aroma , and an earthy taste . it is unique alright , but not like a tea to me . maybe it takes getting used to . 
=================
watered down sports drink this is the latest foray into the " all natural " nutritional drinks market . despite boasting " real fruit juice " on the packaging , the flavor is simply too watered down to notice . having drank plenty of coconut water , this drink has barely more than a hint of it . most likely , it clashes with the taste of the guava , which is also hardly noticeable . in fact , were it not for the label on the packaging , this reviewer would not have been able to tell what the flavor was meant to be . speaking of the which , the odd packaging is rather reminiscent of the fruit juice packs aimed at kids , sans the accompanying straw . also , this 8 . 5 ounce drink will not go far to quench anyone's thirst or give any noticeable energy boost . given the price for a pack of 12 , it is not asking for much to give the consumer more juice for the buck . the nutritional content stacks up nicely to other comparable drinks , however it does have more sugar than some others currently on the market . overall , o . n . e . has produced a product that is nothing special in the world of sports drinks . while it does offer fairly solid nutritional content , the bland taste and small size does not make this a good value .

good movie , horrible dvd i love this movie and i bought it on vhs a long time ago . recently i bought the regular pg version on dvd at my mom's store . the first thing i noteced was that the disc was double sided ! about halfway thru i had to flip the disc over to watch the rest of the movie . and another thing : it was censored . i don't mean just the " violence " i mean language . then i bought the pg - 13 version hoping for a better verson . instead i found out it was the same thing , just with a different cover . so i reccomend you buy the vhs . trust me , it sucks .

little whiskbroom pellets even the dog wouldn't eat this . seriously . i wanted something healthy , free of corn syrup , msg , soy this - and - that , and all those multisyllabic mystery ingredients that only the fda could love . this cereal gains a star for that . the ingredients are " wheat bran , whole grain corn flour , whole grain wheat flour , corn bran , cinnamon " . ( the nutrition panel does mention that the cereal is produced in a facility that also handles soy , dairy , and tree nuts . ) but there's got to be something natural that can be added to pick up the flavor a bit . as it is , it tastes like pressed sawdust . any cinnamon included is so subtle as to not be noticeable . nature gives us fiber in flavorful packages - vegetables and fruits . if fiber is the main goal , there are tastier ways to get it . the texture is pretty much pressed sawdust too . there's got to be a way to at least make it texturally interesting . the drab color is fine , that means the product has no artificial food dyes . i don't care so much about visual appeal but it is a little disconcerting opening a box and seeing contents that are formed like snail pellets . with a name like " simply fiber " the appeal is going to be for old folks seeking the grail of an expeditious digestive system . the absence of typical ingredients may also appeal to those who find themselves allergic to many processed foods . my interest was more in just the general " healthy " appeal . to give the manufacturer their due , it's probable that some of nature's flavoring agents might not last long on the shelf . next thing you know there's the temptation to dump in a bunch of preservatives , and that's not necessarily a good trade - off . you know how breakfast cereals typically liven up the front of the box by populating the cereal bowl with colorful fruits or berries ? in this case i think it's not just decorative , it's a good idea . reasonably expect the cereal to be a little dull , and compensate by slicing in some strawberries , blueberries or bananas . on the bright side , this is only 100 calories to a 3 / 4 cup serving , according to the side panel . that serving packs 14g of fiber . at first bite i was tempted to toss the box but i'll probably keep it on hand and toss a baggie of this stuff in with my lunch for that hand - to - mouth grazing a person does for a mid - morning snack . that's certainly less fattening than what passes for granola . in sum , the product isn't calorie - heavy and it will appeal to aging boomers with digestive issues . it may also be a product of choice for those with certain allergies .

yak bone made my dog yak ! made my dog yak , but he certainly enjoyed it otherwise . me , not too much ! he seems to be able to tolerate the bone if he doesn't " eat " it and bite off chunks . it doesn't smell like rawhide can and it is soft for the puppy teeth and gums .

english toffee , not so great . since i read how great the english toffee tasted , thats the flavor i chose . it does sweeten my coffee but the flavor of the english toffee isnt that great . i will probably end up throwing it out because why drink something you dont enjoy . i would like to try the orange or chocolate but am afraid it will be a waste of money like the english toffee . i personally wouldnt recommend it .

beware - tested on myself - burns like fire ! ! ! my aussie mix acted like i was hurting her no matter how gentle i was applying this stuff for general cleaning of her healthy ears . noticing cinnamon leaf oil in the ingedients , i wondered if that might not be an uncomfortable thing to squirt on tender membranes . i tried a little on a q - tip in my own ear and yow ! ! ! ! ! it took copious rinsing with saline solution to stop the burn , which indeed felt just like i'd stuck one of those kid - treat cinnamon oil toothpicks in my ear . i felt terrible for having inflicted it on my dog , and especially on the ears of my recently - deceased 21 year old cat , who didn't seem to enjoy the experience either . i wrote a detailed letter to ark naturals immediately , worried that this formula is out there being put in other animals' ears . it has been over a month with no response whatsoever . no matter what their response is , i think this is disgraceful and suspect . the ingredients claim to be human - quality - - i recommend testing it on yourself to see if you may be inadvertently hurting your pet . mine is lot # 61180 , fyi .

used to be good , now it's just awful my wife and i started a tradition years ago where we would make boboli pizza's and rent a movie every weekend . the boboli crusts that used to be so good have progressively become worse and worse the last couple of years . what used to be a thick but light crust with lots of cheese on it has become a blob of almost uncooked dough with only a couple specks of cheese . they seem to keep changing the recipe and each time it gets worse . it's definitely time for a new tradition ! ! !

directions say that it needs guar gum dehydration directions say that you need guar gum . i just added the required water in order to mix it in with a recipe and it came out like water . the guar gum is a thickener , like cornstarch . flavor wise , i think it tastes like sheep or goat milk . . . i'm not sure but i don't like it .

cross contamined with peanuts / nuts or eggs i bought this product because it had an allergy allert but it forgot to mentioned that it is manufactured in same facility with other nuts and that it might contain eggs . we have a person with peanut and egg allergy at home and ended up having to call rescue after two bites . out of the 6 cans , we only opened 3 and they were all melted or broken . terrrible .

you should not use this vendor unless you can wait for a long time . i placed this order on may 23 , 2011 along with several other items . all of the other items arrived as scheduled . today is june 13 , 2011 and still no product . i have contacted rice bakery via amazon email and not received a reply from them . this is the first time that i have had any problem with amazon or their vendors . how long can it take to package and ship 3 bottles of rice wine ? i will eventually find out if the product is worth the wait . that is if i live long enough .

coffee taste the beans were fresh nice looking smelled very nice . the brew if made to strong had a bad bitter taste . the coffee did not have a true itialian roast flavor as i know it . for a daily cup it was ok and i made it thru the 5 lb in about 7 weeks . i was happy to have finished it and probably will not order again . i would rate it about a 4 on a 10 scale .

nonni's toffee almond & lemon biscottis great product ; unfortunately shipping took a toll on the biscotti's ( majority arrived in crumbs & broken pieces ) . have since ordered an additional 8 boxes . the lemon ones were shipped in a second amazon box which seemed to provide some additional protective , as only a few were broken in some of the boxes . would recommend seller in the future ship all 12 pack boxes in a second box and add extra cushioning protection . it would allow folks to dunk their biscotti's rather than have to eat direct from the wrapper and get crumbs everywhere .

on the verge of being good , but something's missing i ordered this for my birthday . i got birthday money from family , and i ordered a couple of goodies , perfume , and this cocoa . i love hot chocolate , and i'm always looking for new ones to try . based on the first review i decided to go ahead and order . i will probably not reorder . mixed by itself into hot water it seems to lack thickness . it also has too much of an artificial raspberry taste . i like hershey's bliss raspberry chocolate much better . i've been adding one spoonful of the cobblestone kitchen to my regular cocoa to give it a raspberry boost . but , by itself , it does not stand up to the test . i plan on finishing the three remaining cans over time by using it as a stir in additive to other cocoa .

supplier is shipping out - of - date product i had to give a rating in order to make a comment . i really like eden organic beans . i have used them for many years . i usually purchased them locally when available . however , the beans that i just received from this online source are out - of - date . the black beans have 2008 expiration dates and the pinto beans have 2007 expiration dates . check the dates before you open them . i just cooked one package of beans before thinking to check the date . i thought that would not even be an issue since i was ordering them direct . what is going on here ? mine have such old dates that i don't know if i should use the rest of them .

5 star veggie meal that you can drink ! what it is ? on campbell's website which includes v8 products [ which they also produce ] i found the following info about " campbell's low sodium tomato juice " ; " campbell's tomato juice is packed with goodness . each 8 oz . serving of campbell's tomato juice contains : full serving of vegetablesonly 50 caloriesvitamin avitamin c20 mg of the antioxidant lycopene " most importantly , this " low - sodium " variety has only 140 mg . sodium and 920 mg . potassium compared to 680 mg . sodium and 430 mg . potassium in the standard tomato juice product ! why should you want it ? if you are looking for taste , nutrition and low carbs / calories , this beverage is for you . add to that , low sodium in this particular variation , and you have a drink we should all be drinking . i was always a bit reluctant to indulge in this yummy tomato - fest because of the huge amount of added sodium , but now the low - sodium product has become much more available and costs only 30 % more than the original high - sodium version . typically , this low - sodium , mixed 100 % tomato juice is the type of drink that sells for $ 2 - 4 at a juice bar per 8 - ounce serving or about $ 8 - $ 10 per quart from a health food store in bottles . by the way : campbell's tomato juice is available in several varieties : regularlow sodiumhealthy request®organiccampbell's website ( . . . ) has nutrition info on all their products and each of the 4 tomato juices individually . however , the only difference on the label of each variety of tomato juice was in the amount of sodium it contained . obviously , their are other differences , but label standardization eradicates their ability to illustrate it to us . it may take time to get use to tomato juice without salt , but one can taste the tomato in the juice for a change in this product .

only suggests the taste of bacon . . . this is a product with a lot of promise - low sodium , no fat , shakes on anything . . . but it ultimately fallls short . it just does not have flavor that evokes real bacon . it is a halfway decent general purpose seasoning ( think of another take on traditional seasoned salt ) but it's a far , far cry from real bacon flavor . i would rank this at about 20 % accurate bacon flavor , the venerable artifical bac - o - bits we've all had over the years are just about as authentic tasting , maybe even slightly more . if you can manage to use real bacon bits , there is no comparison . still , i applaud them for trying , and i'll give any revised formula a try if and when they come out with it .

artificial acid - like taste mio mango peach comes in a handy dental - floss looking bottle , and has 24 servings in a bottle . basically you squirt some in plain water , and this enhances the water with a semi - artificial peach / mango taste . it also seems to contain food - color , since it tints the water a light peach color . i was curious to try mango peach mio , but i confess it really isn't something i care to repeat . the drink does enhance the water with a semi - fake artificial peach taste , but i confess i prefer my water straight and without the extra fake - flavoring and acid . while the taste was appealing , i don't need the extra chemicals or food dye in my diet , and as the main ingredients are : water and malic acid and contains zero fruit juice , you aren't really getting anything healthy here . i also found the ingredients in this drink mix irritating to my bladder , so those with painful bladder syndrome should be aware this drink contains acid . if you like artificial drinks of the crystal light variety , this might appeal to you . for me , while the idea was innovative , i would like it to be more healthy to consume and without the food dye and acidity .

the same as any other dark roast k - cup i drink a lot of k - cups due to the fact that my work has the machines and provides a great assortment of flavors . i would compare the kona k - cups to just about any other k - cup that's medium or dark roast . it's a decent flavor , but a huge disappointment because i was overly optimistic that it would taste closer to real kona that is fresh brewed a more traditional way . if you aren't expecting too much , this is a decent cup of coffee . if you want anything close to authentic kona taste , you need fresh beans and not freeze - dried plastic cups . if your only experience with kona is this stuff , you're missing out on a great cup of coffee at a decent price .

candy was fine , but . . . my husband and i ordered these for a family member for christmas . because they used to live in germany , we thought it would be a fun little gift to send them . although the candy itself was fine , the box that it come in was ripped and smashed . i guess i was just disappointed in the way it was packaged and mailed . it was put into a large envalope with no extra padding or anything . i mean , the point of the gift was the candy itself which was fine but it would have been nice if the original box had not been ruined . i had to throw away the box and find something else to put it in .

packaging design flaw i love vitacoco and would drink it all the time if it didn't cost so much . i also like having more to drink with the 17oz container , but the way that the container is packaged makes it impossible to get all of the beverage out of the container by pouring alone . it gets caught around the plastic lip that protrudes into the container . i usually end up cutting the top open , if i have something sharp handy , and get the remainder of the wonderful drink that way . just an fyi since i find it very frustrating to have to throw it away with some still left over .

my dog loves stella and chewy's too bad it didn't get here my dog loves stella and chewy's dried dog food . one patty mixed with a little of her good canned food and she is very happy and her digestive system is working perfectly . ever since we found stella and chewy's her eating habits have improved dramatically . i have ordered the food from amazon since we first found it in an out of town dog food store . however - this shipment was sent via ontrac . a service i had never heard of . i am an amazon prime member so when i didn't receive it i tracked it - it said it was delivered to my door at a time when i know i was home . i called the customer service who tracked down the driver and evidently apologized because he delivered it to an entirely different building at an entirely different address . how is that even possible to enter in that you left it at a door successfully but it was not even in the same building ? so i guess they are going to try and find it - in the meantime , my dog is out of food . . . very disappointed .

mr . picky cat eats them my cat happily scarfed down some of these . these cat dental treats appear to be different than others . dentashield coats the the teeth to block tarter formation . the directions say to feed the cat 4 - 5 of these twice a day . i'm guessing this little pouch to be about 2 weeks worth at that rate . corn flour is the first ingredient , not really the best stuff for your cat but corn is often a major ingredient in catfood anyway . as a treat , its probably okay , but these would be better labeled corn & chicken treats than salmon treats . having said that , the cat doesn't really appear to care ( he can't read ) . appears to be a nutritional supplement as well as a dental treat . wish there was some way to know what the rda of this stuff is for cats . the ingredients : corn flour , chicken meal , wheat flour , corn gluten meal , poultry fat , dehulled soybean meal , salmon meal , sodium hexametaphosphate , poultry digest [ what is that ? ? ] , dried brewers yeast , calcium carbonate , potassium chloride , salt , choline , chloride , lecithen , vitamin e supplement , niacin supplement , vitamin a supplement , calcium pantothenate , vitamin b12 supplement , riboflavin supplement , biotin , thiamin mononitrate , folic acid , pyridoxine hydrochloride , vitamin d3 supplement , menodione sodium bisulfite complex , ferrus sulfate , zinc oxide , manganese oxide , copper sulfate , cobalt carbonate , ethylenediamine dihydriodide , sodium selenite , mineral oil , dl - methionine , taurine , color added ( titanium dioxide , yellow # 6 , blue # 1 ) , bha ( a preservative ) , mixed tocopherols ( a preservative ) . guaranteed analysis : crude protein min : 25 % crude fat min : 8 % crude fiber max : 4 % moisture max : 10 % vitamin a 2 , 273 iu / lbvitamin e 14 iu / lbzinc 75 mg / kgselenium . 1 mg / kgtaurine . . 1 % calorie count 1 . 1 per treat

5 . 5 month update - do not buy this product ! ! ! ! ! ! no matter how great an idea this item sounds like , do not buy it ! ! ! ! after all the buttpain this product has already caused me ( see below ) , a mere 6 days after receiving the replacement for the first defective driveshaft , turns out this " new " driveshaft has the same problem ! ! ! ! it seized up , and will not allow the blade to turn . at least the first driveshaft had the decency to work for 3 months . unbelievable that this product is still being sold on amazon , i am positive i am not the only one this is happening to . short of getting my money back , there's pretty much nothing baby brezza can do to make this right . send me another driveshaft ? ? ? yeah right ! ! ! ! > > original review > > had no issues with the baby brezza until now ( month 3 ) . the mystery black stuff i read about in other reviews has started making regular appearances and the blade is starting to get stuck when blending for no apparent reason . i really love what this product has allowed me to do ( i make food in it to feed myself as well as my son ! ) , but bummed that i'm encountering this problem which , from casual browsing of the other amazon reviews , is not a rare manufacturing defect , but rather a design defect / quality control failure which causes a $ 100 piece of machinery to fail just a few months after purchase . calling baby brezza customer service today to see how they can rectify this situation ( thank god i saved the box ) . > > > update 25 april 2012 > > > ! ! ! ! ! important information for brezzas with lot number mwi - 001bru ! ! ! ! ! ! ! after a few days of phone tag , the baby brezza rep contacted me and let me know that the particular lot number ( look for that on the bottom of the base ) of my brezza was indeed having the issues i described , due to a faulty driveshaft . the rep said they would " exchange " my faulty drive shaft for a new one , but unfortunately , the " new driveshafts " are still being made . and wouldn't be available to ship for approximately 5 weeks . their " consolation prize " was a free accessory ( of course , i had already purchased most of the accessories back when i bought the brezza ! ) . pretty damn inconvenient when you have a really hungry 7 1 / 2 month old baby . so if you have this lot number , even if it's working now , i would definitely lean forward in the foxhole and get baby brezza to send you a replacement driveshaft . the fact that they didn't offer to send a whole new unit instead of making me wait 5 weeks , and that they don't even have these new driveshafts yet , means to me that it may not only be this lot , but any other lot manufactured from july 2011 on that has the defective driveshaft . so buyer beware on this product if you haven't already bought one . it's a fantastic concept , just bad , bad , bad quality control for the $ $ $ cha - ching $ $ $ $ it costs . > > update 15 may 2012 > > received a replacement driveshaft , blade and container ( with lid ) today , along with the " sorry for the inconvenience " gift of a food storage unit . it's been about 3 weeks since i spoke with the brezza rep . not bad , given the estimate she gave me was 5 weeks . originally i was told only the driveshaft would be sent to me , so i'm pleased that i now have a backup container and blade ! i am satisfied , and have changed my rating , because i really do love what this product does !

one of my cats loves them i have 2 cats , one male and one female . the male is crazy about these . i just discovered that he got the bag , ripped it open and ate them all . i had started with a small bag to be sure at least one of them liked them , so not too bad a loss . the female just sniffed and walked away , but she is not crazy about fish flavored treats anyway . i just reordered a big bag of the poultry flavored ones . i am sure the male will like them and i hope the female goes for these as her teeth are the worst of the 2 of them .

pretty potent powder ! i thought it was just a fluke , but i tested it several times . this stuff completely annihilates my stomach . everyone's body is different , so i can only speak from my own experience . i kept forcing myself to take it because it has a ton of vitamin c in it , but the stomach pains were so bad i had to stop . only other thing i can say is that i was using a half a teaspoon or less towards the end and it still hurt my stomach . i cant recommend or not recommend this product because i don't know if it will hurt your stomach . and if it doesn't , then rock on ! ! ! that is a lot of vitamin c ! ! ! as for the taste . . . as long as you mix it with something sweet you wont notice much difference in flavoring .

if you like candy that you don't really chew ! it tasted good but it was not as soft as i was expecting it to be . i don't really like hard candy that stays in your mouth a long time which is the only down side .

passed the taste test ! everyone should know this is a healthier dog food than walmart brands , like purina , iams , or god forbid moist & meaty . ingredients like ground flax seed , peas , whole carrots , whole sweet potatoes , apples , blueberries and probiotics and the lack of sweeteners , by - products , and low - quality corn show this to be true . i just did a taste test with this harmonic farms and my dogs old iams proactive health and decided to make the results known . i let him smell both thoroughly without letting him eat at first , and placed the two piles a bit apart . he immediately went for the harmonic farms , finished it and didn't even look at the iams before coming back to me wagging his tail hoping for more . dogadvisor . com made me aware of my past mistakes in dog food choices and i was hoping to god he would not shy away from the healthy organic stuff like i do . to my great welcome surprise , he didn't ! i guess he's a hippie at heart . i on the other hand , will take my nachos bell grande .

bbq popcorn this tastes like the seasonings on bbq potato chips , so i like this one . it might just be my batch , but it doesn't seem to flow out of the shaker as smoothly as the other flavors though . and like all of these seasonings not all of the seasoning will stick to the popcorn and will wind up at the bottom of the bag or bowl , i don't think there is a way to get all the seasoning to stick unless you drench every single kernel of popcorn in butter spray . this stuff is cheap enough i don't mind , and keeps me out of the high fat and high calorie snacks . 
=================
salted styrofoam - but low - cal ! gourmet basics indeed ! i think the basics are to keep it simple and let the natural flavor of the food shine through . i am blown away that they have actually managed to make a " natural food " taste faker than andy capp hot fries , 3 - ounce bags ( pack of 12 ) . rice cakes have a luxurious mouth - feel compared to these . i couldn't get past the fake flavor and horrible texture . i just can't imagine what type of odd palate people must have to think that these abominations are tasty . perhaps people who are on a restricted diet might find these a convenient snack food . or parents tricking their kids into eating healthy . i can almost promise the parents that these snacks will go uneaten . i would have been more likely to eat the unsweetened baker's chocolate in the pantry before i'd eat these . though this product might be suggested by amazon if you purchase popcorners or popchips , do not buy it . these are nothing like popcorners or popchips , these " smart fries " are nothing but awful .

as expected , although elixir instead of react . . . . it's gum , that's all you need to know . disappointed that there was elixir in the pack , instead of react . seems like something that shouldn't be screwed up .

chewy gooey , or mushy pasty ? i am on a quest for a satisfying grocery store chocolate chip cookie . unfortunately , chips ahoy chewy gooey didn't get me any closer to my goal . for context , i like regular chips ahoy , but don't consider them great ; i prefer a softer texture . chewy gooeys are not hard , but also not really soft . more mushy , or squishy . also , the fudge filling isn't gooey , more like pasty . the overall mouth feel is too oily for my taste . finally , i couldn't get the resealable package to open correctly and had to put the remaining cookies in another container . when i gave one to my husband telling him that i didn't care for it , he popped it in his mouth and disagreed with me saying , " i don't know , they're ok . " we won't be buying any of these to stock our pantry . ps . a quick warm up in the microwave helped the texture of both the cookie and filling , but not enough to change my mind about future purchases . 
=================
not bad , considering it's healthy this is not a product i would ever consider buying . i'm the only person left who leaves the house without a bottle of water clutched in my fist , as if i were sanders of the desert setting out to find the source of the nile . i will not , on principle , eat an eggwhite omelet , and usually consider any salads other than tunafish the stuff you push away from the real food . but i have a healthy friend , a hiker / jogger type who goes to the gym every morning and can do that dog kick thing that led to my killing an aerobics instructor . i was acquitted . the jury all had expired gym memberships . anyway , healthy friend came over one morning to make nasty comments about my drinking coffee and huddling on the sofa when i could be exercising and hiking and drinking water out of a bottle . after lecturing me until i pulled my bathrobe over my head , she left . . . but she left her bottle of vitamin squeeze energy drink drops behind . this , by the way , is the new water drinkers trend . adding flavos and " energy boosting vitamins . " it turns water into something like diet coke , only with vitamins and without the bubbles and not as good tasting . now me , i don't want my energy boosted because then i might start doing stuff , and i'm happy sitting right here , thank you . so i called healthy friend and said " you left those trendy vitamin drops behind , " and she told me to keep them . obviously this was ploy by the incidiously healthy to ensnare yet another unwilling victim into their web . but boy , did they misunderestimate me . i tried the drops . the taste is sweet , kinda like the kool - ade i didn't like much when i was a kid . maybe little tangier , but not much . i waited for the big energy boost . nada . this will not replace my morning cups of coffee . however , the taste is not bad , the drops are chockful of vitamics from one end of the alphabet to the other , and for people who do this sort of thing , i'm sure it makes them feel even more smug and complacent . anyway , i did not waste the rest of the bottle . i poured it into a big 1 . 5 liter bottle of club soda . with some lime wedges , this is going to be one killer mixer when i add the gin .

beef & chicken canned wellness didn't measure up . we've been ordering wellness for one of our cats who was diagnosed as insulin - dependent diabetic a few months ago . after reading many reviews on the internet , we chose wellness chicken and wellness turkey canned products . this has gone well enough . we though we'd give him a change of taste , so ordered a case of the beef & chicken canned food . he projectile vomited it all over the kitchen . maybe it's the beef , but the remainder goes to the local pound where it will hopefully be appreciated .

hay i grew up making catnip tea , but i always went out in the yard and picked it fresh . i was looking forward to enjoying it again . i was very disappointed . this tea has a strong smell , but it smells and tastes to me , like hay . in all fairness as i said , my expectations were based on fresh ( not dried ) catnip from our yard . i will not make another cup of tea from it , but my kitties are loving it . if your buying for cats or you have had dried catnip tea and liked it , this may be the tea for you , but if your used to fresh catnip this one will not make you purrrrr .

why why why ? why is it so hard to find mars bars in grocery stores these days ? do they just not ship to southeast pennsylvania anymore ? am i shopping in all the wrong places ? they used to be really popular 20 years ago . you'd walk in and there they'd be right next to the snickers and 5th avenue bars , but now . . . i guess they're being pushed to the side for other candy bars . this is an outrage ! i'm not paying more than 5 bucks for a few candy bars either . 
=================
cheaper at local grocery store the tea is fine , slightly weak , but how in the world did they come up with such a high price ? its foolish to buy it through amazon sellers when there are other areas to buy it cheaper . my local grocery store ( giant ) sells it cheaper !

black ants don't even get close to it i bought this product to get rid of black ants in my house . it did not help at all . i even tried mixing it with sugar and placing it where the ants used to go , well they just don't go anywhere close to it , it really looks like it repels the ants , instead of attracting them . i have not found yet a product that work for my ants , except the spray that kills them instantly ( but i cannot spray it in the kitchen , and i have ants all around the counter top , even if it is cleaned to perfection ) .

where's the vegetables ? amy's chilli is among the best but even though amy's soup is organic but like progresso its very watery , campbell's is good but not organic . there use to be a woman on television commercial that would go to restaurants and bellow out , " where's the beef where's the beef ? i know i want to go around bellowing out , " where's the vegetables where's the vegetables ? especially fresh vegetables .

not splenda brand but it is sucralose . . . it arrived and it was kirkland brand sucralose . as long as it's sucralose i guess it's identical but why not advertise it as that and show the actual picture ? knocked of a star for false advertising but i didn't return it and have no complaints about the product itself . 
=================
works , but hard to open . . . buy larger version instead of pod even with the tips shared on how to open it , it's still pretty difficult to open . i guess i have weak hands . my husband usually has to open it for me , and even he doesn't do it with ease . i would recommend getting the larger prepara herb savor instead of the pod . it's much easier to open and can hold more . i could hardly fit any cilantro in the pod ( considering that the grocery sells them in such large bunches and i only use half ) .

=================
way too salty ! ! the seeds are fresh , the shells are hard and the seeds are jumbo sized . the taste is good , but the over - powering amount of salt ruins the experience . the 'ranch' flavor would be much tastier if the salt used were lessened . then again , without the overwhelming amount of salt , david might have to use a bit more of the flavor for which you are actually paying . by the way , i don't often find items too salty , but this borders on the ridiculous , imo . i wholeheartedly endorse the jumbo size seeds , as they are much more enjoyable than the puny 'regular' sized sunflower seeds by david . i will be buying another brand of sunflower seeds in the future , hoping that it will not have the amount of salt the david's have . update : i finished all but a little of the case of david buffalo ranch flavored seeds and bought a case of the jumbo brand ranch flavored sunflower seeds . i compared them back - to - back . the jumbo brand is far less salty and flavorful compared to david's . it will be interesting how i will find the jumbo brand to be after eating them for awhile . right now , they seem a bit 'under - flavored' . still , that is preferable to david's overuse of salt . 
=================
over priced for the quality . the lamb had excessive amounts of fat and grissle . i did't consider it a good value .

not bad i tried this product hoping it will be similar to starbuck's white mocha . . unfortunately its only ( sweet ) . . no flavor of white mocha at all . . i had to made my own mix to have a nice one , where i add coffee & caramel sauce . . it tastes good with this mix . .

product is ok as far as coconut water goes , but bottle designs suck ! coconut water tastes ok as far as bottled coconut water goes . the real thing is what i have grown up on , so i have to settle . but i don't like this bottle , the packets should be better . when you open the wrapper , you have to be careful because there are plastic pieces as sharp as a knife still hanging around and you can cut your finger or lip on it . . . i have ! 
=================
there are plenty better . i'm a vegetarian and enjoy all kinds of fake meat products and will not buy this one again . texture is a little soggy and flavor is not that great . it's ok but there are better products out there . try worthington's frozen stakelets or morningstar's grillers prime instead .

not satisfied for years i used a " making bacon " pan that was invented by a pre teen . it was great except you have to use paper towels to keep the grease from coating your microwave . all the fat dripped in the pan and clean up was easy . i purchased this plan thinking that the lid would keep the grease from flying and i would no longer need to use paper towels . first the little pig face popped off after two uses and we have not been able to reattach it . i cannot seem to get the cooking time right with this pan - either over cooks or under cooks . the ridges of the pan are not tall enough to keep the bacon out of the grease . this unit is going to the local thrift shop and i hope i can find a making bacon pan to replace it .

messy ! ! ! the cost of this item was great ( i thought ) . the problem i had though , was when i opened the shipping box i had powered stevia all over . i thought that maybe it was just a couple packs leaked . no ! ! ! so far , 2 out of 3 boxes had at least 15 of the packs miss cut , therefor they were not sealed . it's like they were misfits ! had to wipe each packet , and so now the cost really wasn " t that great ! ! ! i would have sent them back , but i really needed them . 
=================
not for everyone , especially me . the product description says that this tea is 'slightly sweet' as well as a bunch of other descriptors , but i didn't get any sweetness at all . i was very optimistic because i normally love everything tazo offers , but this time i had my hopes dashed . i brewed up a mug of this tea and was immediately alarmed at the bouquet . the teabag smelled different , but once the hot water hit it the smell seemed to really magnify . but i scooped in a few teaspoons of sugar and hoped for the best . i managed to choke down about a third of the cup before i called it a day . life is too short to drink something you don't like . however , i had read a review that mentioned how good and palatable this tea was when combined with the tazo lotus . i figured it was worth a shot , otherwise i'd have to throw out this tea altogether . the lotus smelled great , so i was excited . i blended the two bags ( one lotus and one wild sweet orange ) in a large mug , then removed the wild sweet orange after a minute . i left the lotus in for another minute or two ( yeah , definitely two ) . the result was a very unusual , but not unappealing , beverage . would i drink this more than once a day ? no . was it very interesting and something that i'll try again ? yes . live and learn , i guess .

what the heck ? what the heck is going on with lipton darjeeling ? it disappeared from every one of the indian shops in the s . f . bay area about 6 months ago . the tin you see above sold for about $ 11 . this tea was one of the best kept secrets i know . now the only tea approaching . . . and i mean it is not as good . . . it is peet's darjeeling , at $ 10 for 1 / 4 lb . tin . the only other alternative for darjeeling is to go to some of the persian groceries and find it there . they sell a brand that apparently has lower - quality darjeeling that appears to be imported from india into iran , then sent to u . s . you could probably find other ethnic stores that have the same kind of thing . does anyone have an explanation for what is going on ? 
=================
tis is my least favorite flavor by alessi i didn't really care for the texture of the raviolini which was a little tough and is nothing like ravollini . my favorites in order of my favorite to least favorites are : 1 . split pea ( i add parmesean cheese and bacon ) 2 . tuscan white bean3 . neopolitan bean soup4 . milanase rissotto ( not a soup , it's actually flavored rice but it taste great with grilled or fried chicken ) 5 . minestrone ( just okay ) 6 . raviolini chicken soup ( the only one that i didn't like ) i haven't tried everything that alessi makes but they do make some really good soups !

tastes like melted vanilla ice cream absolutely the best tasting ready to drink protein drink i have found . the negative review said that they received a bad ( separated ) product . this has happened to me too . after all , it is protein - and if it gets too hot - ( like when the delivery people leave it in the hot sacramento sun in the summer ) - it will clot . i just called the company and they shipped out a replacement order . . . . . no problemor , like the reviewer said . . . . just order the powdered version .

not the cereal i remember . . . i'm surprised to read the other reviews for this product . . . i was soooo excited to find my favorite honey nut clusters on amazon after searching for so long in the grocery stores where i live . i could not contain my excitement the day i knew that they would be delivered ! i got home to find 3 beautiful boxes with that memorable little squirrel smiling at me . . . i had to have a bowl immediately ! ! as i poured the clusters into my bowl . . . i thought to myself " hmmmm . . . this doesn't look quite right " i procedeed with faith that it had just been so long since i had seen the cereal . as i took my first bite i knew it was too good to be true . . . " these are not the honey nut clusters i know and love ! ! " i continued to eat hoping that i was imagining it or that it would just take a few bites to set in . but alas . . . honey nut clusters truly do not exist anymore . this cereal is more like honey oat clusters i do not see nut clusters . i even checked the other 2 boxes to insure that the first one was not just a bad batch . so to all those cluster lovers out there . . . i am sorry . . . but the end is here : - ( rip original honey nut clusters ! ! ! you will be missed ! ! as for those of you in search of the next best thing . . . let me introduce you to honey graham oh ! s and you can get them at a grocery store near you !

=================
tastes like juice but not a substitute as with other varieties of this product , it tastes as advertised , black cherry , but i'm wary of any health claims . while it may be made of juice it isn't juice and juice isn't as good for you as the solid fruit . in this small can , only 8 . 3 oz , there is 130 calories so be wary of that too . if you love soda pop i think this could be a healthier version but if you don't , don't start drinking this this . make sure that you like the actual taste of the fruit in question and not a soft drink version because this is the real deal in terms of taste . 
=================
tastes good but smells odd this will be a quick review , the acai blueberry is better than this but the black current vanilla still tastes pretty good . the major complaint and this is weird but in my opinion the fragrance the tea gives off smells like cat pee in a litter box . i know its bizarre but there's something odd in the tea that stinks like cat urine . stick with the acai blueberry you won't be disappointed . 
=================
buyer beware ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i know you may be confused because i gave it 5 stars but wrote buyer beware . let me explain5 stars is because the treats are great thick moist and chewey and my dog loves them and i give " addiction dog food " 5 stars for their producthoweveri give the store that you order this from 1 star if i could give it less i would ! ! it is a rip off and jipit says you get 12 oz bag . . . . ummm not ! you 100 % get " only a 4oz bag " this company also sends old stuff . not once not twice but 3xs this happened to me . i stay clear of them now !

i've had better i bought a bunch of the kitchens of india items during a promotional sale and the only one i'd recommend is the butter chicken sauce . if they were tasty i could overlook the salt content for the occasional enjoyment but i'm not loving the taste . i ofter buy similar products from trader joes and those , in my opinion , are much better and cost far less .

hard hearted candy manufactured all year , sold now . for some reason i love this chalky , vaguely fruity flavored confection . i've been waiting all year for valentines day so i can go out of control and eat these things for no apparent reason . i purchased six of this exact product in this exact size ( 7oz ) and label : five from one supermarket and one from another . the candy seems stale . the purple ones are rock hard and i'm afrade i'll break a tooth so i throw those away , and the green ones are almost as bad so i've given up on them . that leaves the yellow , pink , orange ( usually ) and blue ones as safe to eat . these aren't supposed to be hard candy , are they ? the necco web site says these hearts are produced all year for sale during the valentines holiday period . they are supposed to be soft candy . so it seems that you may get a bag from eleven months ago or a couple weeks ago . good luck ! i think i got the from spring 2011 . by the way , i got my 7 oz bags for only a fraction of the coin demanded here , so best to look at the grocery store in the seasonal items area first . also , i bought a bag of the brach's conversation hearts and did a comparison . the brach's product seemed fresh with no rock hard hearts , but the flaver is a bit more bland . it's difficult to tell if the different color brach's hearts are meant to be different flavors . they're more like just fresh sweet chalk .

melted quickly , evenly - but very sweet , bad packaging the chocolate melted amazingly quickly and evenly . so much easier than cocoa or baker's chocolate with fats , etc , in a double boiler ! just put them in a microwave safe bowl , zap em , and set out some parchment paper for easy clean - up of the dipped items . however , it is much sweeter than other dark chocolates . certainly it is sweeter than i would have preferred . in addition , the bottom of the container had broken just as i lifted it out of the box in which it had been mailed - it was extremely thin , thinner than the lid , and the sides are sharp and basically cut the bottom in a circular pattern . so the remainder is now in tupperware and luckily i caught it before too much fell out .

be wary of amazingclubs ice cream of the month club i ordered the 6 month ice cream of the month club for my wife's birthday . she received her first shipment today and none of the 4 ice creams that were sent matched the sheet they included explaining the ice creams ( you could have bought several of the ice creams , such as butter pecan or mint chocolate chip , in your local grocery store ) . when i called the 800 number i was told that occasionally they reserve the right to change the ice cream if it doesn't " meet their quality " guidelines . when i told her none of the four ice creams that we received matched the overview sheet from amazingclubs , the customer service rep was rude and told me that i needed to call back and talk to someone in their " support group " ( note : you must call before 6 : 00 pm est to speak to someone in this group ) . i would seriously caution you to shell out more than $ 300 for this club .

tastes just ok but what's in it ? the new " dark chocolate " flavor of kellogg's special k granola bars tasted ok out of the box . the texture was a little grainy , but not in a whole - grain sort of way . it was like there was some sort of powdery / grainy filler in it , which i think may be the extra fiber they tout on the label . i took a look at the ingredients . typically for a kellogg's product , the ingredients list was very , very loooong . i looked at the first ingredient and stopped right there . " what's 'soluble corn fiber' ? " i wondered . i googled the term and found some interesting things . one blog posting caught my attention . i think i'm not allowed to post external links here , but you can just google " soluble corn fiber " and find a posting called " link between corn syrup & artificial sweeteners . " it said that " soluble corn fiber " is just another term for " corn syrup , " and that the manufacturer of splenda , who also markets soluble corn fiber , was suggesting that food packagers could use that term to avoid consumer sensitivities to the term " corn syrup , " or , especially , " high fructose corn syrup . " that's not to say that this is not a healthy ingredient . it's just to point out that you may wish to learn more about food - processing ingredients whose names seem new and different to you and then draw your own conclusions . there are other postings that go even more deeply into this issue relative to soluble corn fiber . so , the product is chewy and sweet , with a slight hint of dark chocolate flavoring . obviously , they're going for a " dark chocolate " variety because of all the news about how healthy small amounts of dark chocolate can be for you . maybe that's why i was a bit skeptical when i saw the first ingredient here was something new to me . the flavor is good - - i just didn't love that grainy texture . we also have the issue of the packaging size . the box contains 5 bars , and the bars are on the small size , at that . but the box looks about the size of one that might contain 6 full - sized granola bars . also , the individual bar wrappers are quite oversized . once you open the wrapper , you see that the bar looks small inside it . the stats : each box contains 5 bars that are 0 . 95 ounces ( 27 grams ) each . total net weight , 4 . 76 ounces ( 135 grams ) . you can compare with your own boxes of granola bars . back to ingredients . after the soluble corn fiber , you have rolled oats . that's good . then isolated soy protein . ( i'm tempted to google again . ) then sugar . then " cereal ( rice , whole grain wheat , sugar , wheat bran , soluble wheat fiber , salt , malt flavoring , vitamin b1 , vitamin b2 , riboflavin ) . " notice that all that parenthetical stuff combined comes in after sugar - - not really a lot of " cereal " in this . then fructose , semisweet chocolate , vegetable oil ( hydrogenated and / or partially hydrogenated palm kernel , palm , canola and / or coconut oil ) , corn syrup , chicory root fiber , rice , dextrose ( isn't that the same as or similar to fructose ? ) , and . . . that's about two - thirds of the way down the list . there's a lot more . if you don't care about ingredients , it's a reasonably tasty snack that fills you up a little bit . personally , i get filled up much more by eating a fresh , juicy apple or a handful of grapes . kellogg's owns kashi , a brand i like . i really think they can do better than this special k - branded concoction .

smart . . . but not so smart ? the product has a build in chamber that you can fill up simply by squeezing the bottle . there are also markings on the side to let you know how much so you can pour out exactly what is needed . but the problem is the container is not see through , nor can you see it while putting it up against the light . i even tried using a marker to mark the outside . . . . still no luck . i'm basically stuck using a measuring utensil of my own . smart idea . . . . stupid execution . : (

turkish sweet turnip juice ( salgam ) this product arrived as a birthday gift . after chilling it as instructed , i attempted to drink some . the first thought that came to mind as it hit my palate was sea water . salty ! then lemony sourness followed . not a sugary taste that i was expecting . no this does not taste sweet at all and had the sourness approaching that of a lemon . it has a strange but interesting aroma that is not at all bad . in fact i felt drawn to smell several more times trying to put a name on the unexpected yet familiar complex aroma . it reminds me of a bologna sandwich on white bread with overpowering hints of celery . if you are not used to this kind of drink , i will say that it is probably much more of an acquired taste . from wikipedia : & # 350 ; algam is a popular beverage from southern turkey's cities of adana and mersin . although the turkish word & # 351 ; algam literally means " turnip , " & # 351 ; algam is actually made with the juice of red carrot pickles , salted , spiced , and flavoured with aromatic turnip ( çelem ) fermented in barrels with the addition of ground bulgur . it is traditionally served cold in large glasses with long slices of pickled carrots , called tane ( or in some accents , dene . ) hot paprika relish is added just before drinking . hot or regular , it is a popular drink with adana kebab . & # 350 ; algam is often served with rak & # 305 ; ( alcoholic beverage ) - - not mixed , but rather in a separate glass . while & # 350 ; algam is commonly used to cure hangovers , consuming excess amounts may cause bloating .

not bad these brownies are not bad for sugar free . if you are expecting sweet brownies , it is not these brownies . they do not taste bad , but are not sweet either . next time i am going to try and vary the recipe and see what i come up with . i may even add some extra sweetner to bring them up to par . they are cheaper at other low carb sites .

my review is based on the comments of your reviewers i'm looking for a product to cook with , specifically to gift with the popcorn popper i bought for a friend . omg . . . i am all about being organic and green and that's why i looked upon this product . but i am in no way interested in a product whose reviews are from customers who talk about eating it [ oil ] straight out of the can ! ! what is the avg bmi of this country , why are we rated so low on the healthcare ranking list ? ? ? ? i would never purchase such an endorsed product as it reminds me of some zombieoid being drug laced by your product . good luck ; i'll shop at my local health food store with reviewers who are star - eyed at eating lard out of a can .

contains 0g fiber ! i bought this product for the fiber in prune juice to aid in my son's constipation . compared to regular prune juice which has about 1 . 5 g fiber in 4 oz this juice has 0 g fiber in the same volume . the ingredients just list apple and prune juice but don't list how much of each . clearly it's more apple than prune . if your kid likes to drink apple and prune juice then this product is fine but if you're looking for something to help with constipation you should look elsewhere . what a waste .

fine tea , but not whole leaf i had never heard of this tea until finding it here while scanning for something different . different from the pg tips i've been using . i prefer loose leaf but pgtips are pyramid bags . so i searched and found the dilmah web site . all the tea is from the same estates . not blended , they say . one disappointment is that this is broken tea rather than whole leaves . what do they do with the whole leaf ? it is 'loose' , but not 'loose leaf' . the quality of the taste is certainly not impaired . far better than pg tips . more expensive as well .

super soft . . . very tiny though . . . these are very soft , super pliable white flour tortillas for making soft tacos . these are only 6 inch in diameter though but great for portion control if you are trying to limit your carbohydrate count . each package is 8 . 2 ounces and contains 10 tortillas to a pack . these were super fresh tasting and amazingly , the expiration date was 'better if used by 03 january 2013' [ as of my writing this on july 03 , 2012 ] , so these obviously have an excellent shelf - life if you want a staple in your pantry for snacks and whatnot . ingredients : enriched flour bleached ( wheat flour , niacin , iron , thiamin mononitrate , riboflavin , folic acid ) , water , partially hydrogenated vegetable oil ( soybean , cottonseed ) with mono - and diglycerides , glycerin , corn syrup solids , salt , baking powder ( baking soda , corn starch , sodium aluminum sulfate , calcium sulfate , monocalcium phosphate ) , potassium sorbate and calcium propionate ( preservatives ) , monoglycerides , fumaric acid , l - cysteine hydrochloride . nutrition facts : serving size 46 g ( two tortillas ) servings per container 5calories 150total fat 4 gsaturated fat 1 gtrans fat 1 gcholesterol 0 mgsodium 340 mgtotal carbohydrate 24 gdietary fiber 0 gsugars & lt ; 1 gprotein 3 gthese are made in the usa by general mills

long time loyal customer no longer ! i have only fed my 3 dogs canidae since 2002 . until 3 days ago we have had no problems at all , and i had highly recommended the food to everyone who would listen . that is no longer the case . recently , canidae decided to change the formula , and without any notice being placed on the bag . two weeks into the first , and last bag of canidae i will every buy , one of my dogs began chewing his feet . prior to 3 days ago , he had never had a " hot spot " or anything close to it . . . . and now i cannot get him to stop chewing his red , soaking wet paws . one expensive vet bill later , the vet said it is an " allergic reaction . " allergies ? ? ! ! i do not want my dogs to be miserable with allergies ! ! besides the constant chewing , not one of my dogs has had a firm stool since their first meal with the new formula . one of my dogs is prone to anal glad issues , and so it is critical that she have a firm stool . in addition to my issues , my breeder , who recommended the food to me , and who has been feeding her dogs canidae for much longer than i , has taken her dogs off the food . why ? her dogs became violently ill , vomiting non - stop , itching , acting lethargic . she has contacted the many , many people she knows who use canidae , and they have all had issues , many have taken their dogs to the vet , and have all now switched to a different food . . . not made by canidae . it's too bad they chose to make this change ; they have lost countless loyal customers over trying to save money on rice . i can't imagine they will be in business much longer . * * * * * * * * updated 10 / 2 / 08 : i've moved all my dogs to california natural . my breeder has also switched her dogs to california natural . so far everyone is doing great . . . after the canidae got out of their systems .

might as well use spaghetti sauce this sauce is heavy on the tomato , light on the curry flavor . i tried it for the first time , and didn't like it from the moment i opened the jar . it smells like an indian spaghetti sauce , and doesn't taste much different . i wish i had a fresh and easy near me , because they have the best jar tikki masala sauce .

picture does not show product why post a picture of items you are not selling ? i get very frustrated with sellers who use a stock photo of general items instead of the actual items they are selling . it isn't difficult to take a picture of the actual item - or search for a stock photo of the actual item you are selling . what is even * more * frustrating is that they don't bother to list the flavors you are buying since the photo is not accurate . the picture shows six different flavors of activate . i actually thought i was receiving all six since activate has many more than six flavors . i thought that is what " variety " meant . i received three bottles each of four different flavors . are they relying on their legal disclaimer to diffuse their laziness ? " actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website . we recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented . . . " even so , that does not say the product is different than the picture . i bought this product because i saw the exotic berry flavor at wal - mart . tried it , and thought it was pretty good . but i don't live near a wal - mart and have not seen it elsewhere . i rate amazon's employee who posted this item with one star since i don't see another way to rate the seller right now . if i easily find a way of rating the seller , i will change my star - rating here . the exotic berry flavor is fine . it is the only flavor i have had . the other flavors shipped in the box are lemon - lime , orange , and fruit punch . had i known that blueberry and pear were not included , i would have purchased a different package from amazon - one where the employee bothered to find the right stock photo of the item being sold .

did not increase milk supply did nothing for my milk supply , even though i had 8 cups of tea a day . tastes pleasant enough ( thankfully , it tastes more like lavender to me than fennel ) , but even though i like tea in general and drink a variety of it every day , it's not pleasant enough for me to drink just for enjoyment . only if i have to - provided it helps me with the supply . it doesn't * . i did a " subscribe and save " for 1 time a month for this tea , and amazon sent the second gigantic box to me 18 days after the first one . now i am stuck with two boxes of tea that doesn't help me and isn't yummy enough to drink every day just for fun . * i purchased fenugreek and blessed thistle in capsules and they helped a lot .

aromatic rooibos tea in a metalic air tight can . i heard some people complain that their rooibos tea smell evaporates when they buy it in bulk in a paper bag . the tea comes in a great metallic container with a lid that seals tight . i kept it on a kitchen counter for about 2 months after opening it and it was fine . in fact , my tea expired in 3 august , 2010 and i just opened it up in february i think , still great smell and taste . you want to use some kind of fine sifter ( tea holder ) as the particles are pretty small if you never had this kind of tea before . rooibos tea has no caffeine , and is a great tea to drink in the pm or late hours , it has a mild pleasant aroma , and reddish / rusty red color to it . it is full of antioxidants and protects the liver from foreign invaders ( helps to detoxify bad substances ) . 3 . 67oz in a jar = 104 grams " with classic bergamot citrus " from western cape in africa . organic . loose tea . ingredients : 100 % organic fair trade certified rooibos , natural essential bergamot oil . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = j ethnopharmacol . 2011 jan 7 ; 133 ( 1 ) : 46 - 52 . epub 2010 sep 15 . effects of rooibos ( aspalathus linearis ) on oxidative stress and biochemical parameters in adults at risk for cardiovascular disease . marnewick jl , rautenbach f , venter i , neethling h , blackhurst dm , wolmarans p , macharia m . sourceoxidative stress research centre , faculty of health and wellness sciences , cape peninsula university of technology , bellville , south africa . marnewickj @ cput . ac . zaabstractethnopharmacological relevance : in south africa , the plant aspalathus linearis ( brum . f ) dahlg . ( fabaceae ) is traditionally used as a " tea " referred to as rooibos or redbush . this plant has been listed as a medicinal plant based mostly on anecdotal evidence . aims of the study : despite a long history of traditional use in south africa , very little scientific data are available from controlled clinical trials confirming its popular use . the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of rooibos on biochemical and oxidative stress parameters in adults at risk for cardiovascular disease . materials and methods : after a washout period of 2 weeks , 40 volunteers consumed six cups of fermented / traditional rooibos daily for 6 weeks , followed by a control period . blood biochemical parameters indicative of antioxidant activity and content ( total polyphenols ) , lipid peroxidation ( conjugated dienes - cds , thiobarbituric acid reactive substances - tbars ) , redox status ( total glutathione - tgsh , ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione - gsh : gssg ) , lipid profile ( total cholesterol , low density lipoprotein - ldl and high density lipoprotein - hdl cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels ) and liver and kidney function were measured at the end of each study period . results : plasma antioxidant capacity was not altered , but plasma total polyphenol levels increased significantly after rooibos consumption compared with the control levels ( from 79 . 8±16 . 9 mg / l to 89 . 8±14 . 1 mg / l ) . significant decreases in plasma markers of lipid peroxidation were found after rooibos consumption , as reported by levels of cds ( 167 . 3±29 . 5 nmol / ml vs . 108 . 8±20 . 1 nmol / ml ) and tbars ( 1 . 9±0 . 6 'mol / l vs . 0 . 9±0 . 3 'mol / l ) . reduced glutathione ( 797±238 'mol / l vs . 1082±140 'mol / l ) and the gsh : gssg ratio ( 41±14 vs . 76±17 ) were both significantly increased after consumption of rooibos . the lipid profiles showed that rooibos consumption , compared with the control values , significantly decreased serum ldl - cholesterol ( 4 . 6±1 . 3 mmol / l vs . 3 . 9±0 . 7 mmol / l ) and triacylglycerols ( 1 . 7±0 . 8 mmol / l vs . 1 . 2±0 . 7 mmol / l ) , while hdl - cholesterol ( 0 . 9±0 . 1 mmol / l vs . 1 . 2±0 . 2 mmol / l ) was significantly increased . conclusion : confirming its popular use , consumption of fermented , traditional rooibos significantly improved the lipid profile as well as redox status , both relevant to heart disease , in adults at risk for developing cardiovascular disease . copyright © 2010 elsevier ireland ltd . all rights reserved .

bogus harissa , a poser this is nothing like the real thing ! i am unable to understand why the amount of positive reviews . i bought this since i was unable to find mustaphas in wegmans supermarket here in ny . to buy mustaphas online is expensive ! ! product price not so bad , but when the shipping is added it is quite pricey ( but well worth every cent ) please trust me on this it is worth it ! i buy mine in the pack of three saves a bit and i use them quickly , however if you really enjoy mina and are 5 star happy with it great ! ! i am happy for you . but i can say this with complete honesty once you have tried mustaphas i doubt you will ever want to buy any other . so how do i describe how wonderful a product mustaphas moccican harissa is ? and how the two compare ( they are so different ) mina is thin weak almost tasting like it came from a can . mustaphas is thick almost as thick as tomato paste with a beautiful deep rich flavor and color which is beautiful , the heat is wonderful , ( you must be able to enjoy the heat ) but it is not just raw heat , it is flavor a depth of flavor that almost allows you to picture mustaphas being made in small homemade batches by artisans who know the taste they are crafting the flavor will transport you ( no magic carpet required ) and you will find so many uses for it . again the flavor is rich sumptuous the level of heat can be adjusted by the amount you use it takes very little to enjoy the rich flavor and it melds with everything but it is hot . i could not find anything that i could use mina on , i tried , it was 9 . 00 for the jar and i felt i must try top like it but in the end i yet threw away a nearly full jar of mina in a household where even the youngest grandchildren love hot sauces and harissa ( in small amounts ) no one at all liked the mina product ! ! my fridge has many bottles of hot sauces , we go through so many , a big favorite is marie sharps one of the most flavorful hot sauces we have ever had discovered it years ago when in belize . i say this so that i might offer you a reference point of my personal taste . i do not mean to compare them as similar products , both are quite different except for astounding flavor , uniqueness , and quality . i hope that this review helps ( and that you will forgive the gramatical errors ) . please check out mustaphas available on the amazon site the jar does not show the name in a pronounced way the print that shows the name of the brand is small the words morrican harissa might help identify or just do a search . but look for it , try it , do not judge harissa by mina ! ! there can be no comparison between the two . if you are happy with mina so be it . but if it is the only one you have tried then try mustaphas take a chance , just be ready to buy a lot of it since you will find so many uses for it , and you will miss it when you run out to be sure . thanks for listening to sum it up , i do not like the mina product at all ! ! i will not belittle it anymore than i have . i would rather offer you positives and mustaphas is that positive to be sure . thanks again

be wary our two - year - old lab , who will eat anything ( almost literally ) , won't touch this stuff . even when we tried mixing it with food he was used to , he just ate around the taste of the wild . . . which is hard to do since the kibble is so small in size . after reading other reviews , we thought we'd try this stuff out , to give our pup a change of pace . well , now we have a full , 30 - pound bag of the stuff . . . wonder if there are any other uses for it ? a door - stop maybe ?

bonaturae egg pasta i ordered this pasta , thinking it was gluten - free , as it came up in the gluten - free search on amazon . my fault , i guess , because i didn't look at it closely enough . i am just irritated with both myself and the company as it was not inexpensive . of course , i have not tried it since i have celiac disease , but i am sure the rest of my family will enjoy it as per the other reviews i read before i purchased it . if i had read further down the review list , i would have seen the review by the person who did the same thing as i did .

less sugar compared to other aloe drinks this brand is sold at trader joes for 2 . 00 each . i was hoping to get it cheaper here . it's tasty , still too much sugar , but less compared to its competition that i have found so far . it has the little aloe chunks in it too .

dogs can't count but i can the item that i ordered was a " 35 pack value bag " but the value went down considerably when what i received was only 21 in each pack . that means , for two packages , i received 28 fewer than advertised - almost another whole package and certainly another package of 21 . either the listing or the price needs to change . still i rated the item as highly as i did because the ultimate customer is my dog and he loves them . so , if you order them , be sure to check the number in the bags you actually receive ( hopefully they'll correct the problem by then ) but treat your dog to them , without reservation !

not edible or fit for human consumption product arrived quick and as exactly described on amazon . only problem is that its stale . this popcorn must be at least two decades old . . . space popcorn from the kennedy era . i was warned . . . another person has commented on the stale popcorn , but please let me to elaborate . when you bite into this warm fluffy popcorn the taste is amazing , but after you chew on that mouth full for three minutes the magic is gone . you can't break this stuff down in your mouth . . . don't even try . bird feed at best .

reese's pieces love reeses pieces ! what else is there that tastes good ? especially if its peanut butter flavored and sweet . 
=================
full of salt and calories one reviewer of the 4 lb . version said there are too many peanuts which overwhelms the combined flavor and that's correct , but the bigger problem is that the nuts are salted ( of course - try finding an unsalted product at costco ) . the salt uniformly covers everything in the bag , including the raisins which do not taste good with salt on them . the result is a bland mix of blended flavors . also , a 2 . 5 ounce portion comes to almost 400 calories so there's no bang for your buck here , either for taste or health .

too much trouble for very little difference i've been experimenting with sourdough starters for about 4 months now and i bought this one expecting it to be the real san francisco deal . after following the instructions , i got a bread that tastes virtually the same as home - made starter . i think the trick that bakeries like boudin have is their baking process . so if you want to mimic their bread , buy the industrial ovens they use and make your own starter .

mexi - cola is the one for me ! i tried this when i first started avoiding high fructose corn syrup . i needed my coke fix , so i tried the mexi - coke and didn't care for it much at the time . fast forward a few months with no soda . . . i tried mexi - coke again and fell in love . i really enjoy it a lot now and if i ever happen to drink regular coke with hfcs , it tastes nasty in comparison ( like dirt or something ) . that having been said , i cannot believe the price here on amazon ! ! i can get a case of 24 for around $ 20 at my local warehouse store . or , i could go to one of many tiendas or coffee shops and buy single mexi - cokes for $ 2 - $ 2 . 50 . what a rip off , amazon ! not cool at all .

tired of being treated so poorly ! this is a review of the seller amazon chooses to deal with vs . a commentary on the product of cafix . cafix is a wonderful coffee substitute giving you that warm drink feeling in the morning without the after - effects of caffeine . it is the best coffee alternative made in my opinion . but dab nutrition ( direct super center ) was terrible to deal with ! they quoted a price for shipping on amazon . com checkout of about $ 6 but then sent me an email that they had cancelled my order and wanted to charge me $ 26 to ship if i wanted to place the order again ! ! ! when i called their customer service department , they refused to send the package via usps which could ship for far less than $ 26 ! ! ! i am getting fed up with the suppliers amazon chooses to deal with when it comes to shipping to hawaii ! wrong shipping quotes and rude customer service - i was even told i lived in a 'foreign' zone once and that the supplier refused to ship to me ! how can amazon allow their suppliers to refuse to ship to a us address ? ? i have chosen to buy my cafix at [ . . . ] where they offer reasonable shipping choices such as usps parcel post . i can get 12 of these tins sent to me via [ . . . ] for only $ 18 . 95 ! forget dab nutrition ( direct super center ) and their rude policies and get your fantastic coffee alternative from an online supplier who cares : [ . . . ] signed , " frustrated in maui "

not recommended for tough chewers if your dog isn't a chewer / destroyer - of - toys like mine , this might be fine . but my lab destroyed the rope and ate the plastic stopper very quickly . also , keep in mind if you live above someone and don't have carpets , the dog will repeatedly drop the bottle on the floor to get the treats out . so had my dog not eaten this toy , i still couldn't have used it very often because it's very loud .

to each their own so first off , i'm not going to pretend that i'm not a rhonj fan , i am . i also would like to state that although i learned about blk from the show i did not try it to bag a manzo boy . i'm trying to make a change in my life , diet wise , and i've heard of the wonderful benefits of fulvic acid and decided to try it . i live in nyc so rather than drive all the way to jersey for a single bottle of water i ordered the case . not gonna lie , i was freaked when i ordered it . loads of people were saying that it had a metallic taste but i figured what the hell . so my case arrived today and when i opened it i immediately thought , this is pretty awesome looking , i hope it tastes good . my sister and i cracked one open and smelled , nothing . poured some out , it appeared to have the texture of * gasp * regular water ! ! so than the big test came , taste . we counted to three and took a sip each and . . . it tasted like regular old water . no metallic taste , no grittiness , nothing . everyone has a different palate so i don't doubt that these other reviewers did experience that but we didn't . try it for yourself instead of taking others' word for it . i'm definitely switching from poland spring to blk .

restricted diets beware for those on a restricted diet or concerned about what you are ingesting , be aware that egg replacer contains both corn - derived ingredients as well as carboxymethylcellulose , a chemical thickener that is indigestible and can cause diarrhea , constipation and bloating . those concerned about your intake of random chemical compounds should reconsider this particular thickener / rising agent in your baking and cooking .

organic brown rice syrup containes arsenic i'm a mother of 19 months old and started using this formula when my son was about 9 months and used it for about 3 - 4 months till he switched to a cow's milk . i did tons of research before deciding on this formula . i thought it was the best one on the market . i have recently found out about a study that published horrifying results about organic brown rice syrup ( the main ingredient in baby's only used as a sweetener in organic food products as an alternative to high fructose corn syrup ) . the researchers found that the two baby formulas that contained brown rice syrup had arsenic levels that were far above the epa standard for drinking water and more than 20 times greater than each of the 15 formulas that didn't contain brown rice syrup . these products were baby's only organic dairy toddler formula and baby's only organic soy toddler formula , both made by nature's one . arsenic levels in the two formulas were also higher than the world health orgnanization's " maximum tolerable daily intake " standard for babies , who are particularly vulnerable to arsenic's neurological effects because of their small size and developing brain . as a mother , i feel dreadful to realize i was giving my child something that could be harmful to him . i just want to warn other mothers about the results so they can make a wise decision .

i want to love this stuff , as the ingredients are great , but : diarrhea . pretty sure this stuff is giving all six of my foster kittens diarrhea , which neither their dry kibble ( blue buffalo wilderness kitten ) nor their alternative wet food ( fancy feast classic grain - free varieties ) do . i don't think they absorb much in the way of nutrition when the food shoots right through them , and of course it's a messy experience for me . not a fan of this product .

looks strong taste like vanilla water i tried the red bush pomengranite and it was quite awesome . full of flavor but not this tea i have put two bags and let it sit for 20 minutes and it still lacks taste on the front end . you catch the vanilla on the back and it is very subtle to the point of where is the taste ? i am drinking it as i write this and still find that red bush tea has very little real flavor . for people who are used to black tea or expresso it would be a joke . i only drink herbal teas but i would suggest you try any other flavor . the bengal spice and pomegranite are excellent . i have to describe the taste is sort of a light tobacco taste ( not a smoker ) with very mild vanilla and lackluster flat taste ( plain or water downed ) base even though the color is deep rich and red . i like the health benefits and will keep buying red bush but not this flavor .

electric doggie door i purchased this product about 4 months ago . the customer service stinks and it's almost impossible to reach a human . my do just fell in the pool and now the collar doesn't work ? thought it was waterproof . i just might contact the bbb on these guys . i hate poor customer service ! there is another company called better life 24 / 7 and i cannot figure out if they are one and the same ?

didn't jamaica me that crazy not the best bean i ever brewed . i'm giving some cred to the company though as they do a good job , this particular blend is just a bit weak for my personal preference . i just couldn't get it strong enough . if you feel the same way try out their highlander grogg that stuff is radical .

its bean flour i wish i could use this flour . i'm new to gluten free and didnt think of the issues " bean flour " could cause . the taste is fine and the banana bread recipe on the bag is wonderful untill its digested . we all had horrible gas pains . i tried it in a couple of recipes but our systems just couldn't adjust . i had to throw the rest of the bag away .

not the real thing i am originally from europe ( germany ) and love italian cooking . after moving to the states , i have a hard time finding the ingredients that i was used to get easily there in the american grocery stores . if i can find them , they are overpriced and of inferior quality ( parmigiano reggiano anyone ? ) . i often feel that people are knowingly tricked by the industry by product names which resemble the " real product " , the best example would be olive oil . happy of at least finding one of my favorite pasta brands ( " dececco " ) , i was looking for the san marzano tomatoes which i was used to get at my local italian grocery store for 1 . 50 euros ( about 1 . 80 usd ) a can ( the acidity of most american canned tomatoes is too high , in my opinion ) . so far , i have only found this brand at the local grocery stores , and after reading the label , i was very suspicious about it - a san marzano tomato , produced in usa ? i gave it a chance anyways , at last , they have a high price and they are still on the market , so they might have something going for them . after opening the can , i instantly saw that these can not be real san marzano tomatoes - san marzanos are long and thin and bittersweet ( once you tried them , you will be able to tell ) , these are spherical and sweet and sour . i have used them in soup and pasta sauces so far , at least they seem to be a little better than the regular canned tomatoes in the grocery store , but it can not justify the price tag - in europe i can get this quality for about a dollar . so if you are searching for a good canned tomato , keep on searching - these here might not taste all that bad , but they are not san marzanos and they are expensive as well .

my aussie kinda likes them my 5 - year - old australian shepherd , pete , has put on a lot of weight in the last 18 months , so i was curious to see how he would take to a low calorie treat . i placed a regular size milk bone , a small beggin' strip , and a zoe treat stick side - by - side on the carpet and invited pete to help himself . being wary like most aussies , he cautiously sniffed each offering , then took the milk bone . when he was finished with the milk bone , he picked the beggin' strip . finally , when there was only one choice left , he took the zoe treat stick . i did this test with him four times to see if he would develop a taste for the zoe treat sticks , but the results were always the same . from a health and caloric point of view , the zoe treat sticks may be the better choice , but pete's interested in them only if nothing else is available . i suppose that's true of people and diet food too . at any rate , pete gives 'em 2 stars .

nice texture , processed flavor to me velveeta tastes like those tin foiled christmas cheeses found in those sausage gift packages : so if you like those christmas cheeses you will probably like velveeta . i like this cheese , but its processed flavor gets to me after a while . from what i understand velveeta is not vegetarian , for those who are concerned about such things . 3 . 75 stars .

my impulse cost me this time i like rich , bold coffee . i have been buying coffee through amazon , the keurig site , costco , and even in a grocery store when i run low . i am searching for the best cup for my taste . neumann's own is the best so far . this sampler was appealing as a way to try many bold k cups without commiting to much to one brand . what i failed to do was recognize the price which was almost $ 1 per k cup ( twice as much as other purchases ) and realize the sample pack would include decaf ( which i did not want ) . next time i will not let my impulse cost me .

wellness core grain - free dry dog food , original recipe , wellness core grain - free dry dog food , original recipe is a wonderful product . i have a german sheppard guide dog and she has allergies to rice , it was hard finding products that didn't contain any rice or grain products . i tried the wellness core and my dog loved it and had no stomach distress . it cost approximately $ 9 . 00 less than what i paid at the store , and no shipping charge . however on my second purchase they wanted to charge a shipping fee of $ 10 . 00 . needless to say i went to the store to purchase it .

50 - 50 made a pasta puttanesca last night to pour over the miracle noodles that i recently bought . they aren't a wheat noodle but they are a passable substitute . at least for me . my wife didn't care for them and i will be finishing up the remaining packages on my own . the texture is similar to a rice noodle but they have almost no flavor of their own . the sauce didn't stick to the noodles as nicely as it does with regular pasta and because of this , the finished dish didn't look all that appetizing . i will try a red sauce next time in hopes that it will make for a better presentation . i give it a thumbs up for anyone trying to cut carbs . my wife a definite thumbs down based on appearance and texture .

definitely not my idea of xtra large this was thin , unlike the last xtra large that i ordered from this supplier . i think it will still work for the dog to chew , at least until is shrinks 2 inches or so . since my dog is a mastiff , i'm afraid that he'd try to swallow the thing whole if it gets too much smaller , due to its thin diameter . so far , he hasn't shown much interest in chewing it . i think he likes the taste of the elk and moose antlers better .

the emasculation of a detroit icon my considerate dad always makes sure to put in a supply of vernors for me when i go home to detroit . i don't know . . . when i was a kid , vernors used to be strong ( it was a popular quasi - medicine among motown moms ) , and when you opened the ( glass ) bottle , you'd see " smoke " ( yeah , i know it's gas - - permit me my fancies ) , the tingling hitting one's nose with a blast that often resulted in sneezing . and finally , i'm dead - sure it was a crisper mouthfeel , with more " bite . " alas . . . vernors , now a pleasant enough ( hence two stars rather than one ) soft drink for woosies , no longer advertises that it's " aged 4 years in wood . " in fact , i don't believe it's aged in anything anymore . hfcs has replaced sugar ( there's that new mouthfeel ) and to make matters worse , vernors is now owned by the heinous dr pepper snapple group - - the bloodsucking corporate monster that permanently crippled the oldest dr pepper bottling plant in the nation in dublin , texas , resulting in a direct loss of 14 jobs ( in this economy , mind you ) and many more by domino effect ( the town's economy turned on its dr pepper connection , including a museum ) , all because dpsg couldn't live with the fact that dublin dr pepper was selling their soda over the internet in supposed violation of their franchise agreement . vernors is now a sweet , syrupy shadow of its former self , pleasant enough to those who don't know better , unable to stand up to the demands of a boston cooler , and every sip of which results in frustration that those truly marvelous things in life that could so easily have remained the same , don't . given that vernors is no longer the product with which i grew up and that they're owned by the soda - producing equivalent of satan , i plan to inform my dad not to continue buying vernors on my behalf . not - what - it - used - to - be vernors has just joined its buddies dr pepper , a & w root beer , and my even - more - beloved - than - vernors squirt ( thank goodness for ting ) in my personal " soda limbo , " along with anything else i happen upon that's owned by dpsg . " woody , " the vernors gnome , is undoubtedly weeping ginger - infused tears .

zico water is good but not in a plastic container ! i love drinking zico's coconut water . in camparison to all others , i find zico's is the closest to fresh coconut water speaking from experience as i'm from an island which frequently have coconut water as a beverage . however , their packaging certainly makes a difference do not purchase zico's coconut water packaged in a plastic bottle as that's the taste you'll experience " plastic " . zico's carton packing is much , much better ! ! ! enjoy

tasty bar but small , nearly expired & contain unhealthy ingredients pros : ( 1 ) tasty ! that's the main reason i bought it . love the melted peanut taste . addictive ! yum . ( 2 ) well , because it's small , it's easy to carry around . lovely dessert . cons : ( 1 ) the bar gets smaller and smaller , while the price stays the same - as other reviewers have pointed out . it's almost half the original size now . ( 2 ) i consider it an unethical business practice to mail out products with an expiration date in 2 months , and fail to disclaim this piece of critical information in the description . the vendor should not sell nearly - expired products like this ! ( 3 ) please note that there are many artificial colorings used in this product , and there is palm oil used . those who are health conscious might want to take note of this . ( i bought it because i didn't read the ingredient list carefully , but you should . )

price is $ 0 . 45 / oz these jams are terrific , but amazon's price per ounce ( on the main page ) of $ 0 . 24 / oz is incorrect . the actual price is $ 0 . 45 / oz . there are four 12 . 5 ounce jars = 50 ounces total . price : $ 22 . 67 . 50 x $ 0 . 45 = $ 22 . 67 .

christmas gift got these as a christmas gift for a friend . i bought the package in " medium " not large . later , as part of the christmas ceremony , i went to visit him and was able to snack on the gift i had sent . the items , with the exception of apricots , were darned near tasteless . i was embarrased and mentioned my finding to my host . he agree : the worst i have ever given him . only the apricots redeemed this as a two star .

all kind of tastes the same . . . i know this is supposed to be the " healthy " alternative for pop drinkers , but i'm just going to continue my shift towards iced green tea for my caffeine and drink fix . the stevia just has too much of a tangy aftertaste for me , and this stuff isn't exactly priced in the everyday - consumption price range .

not the best sender for emergen - cs ! my roomate was getting sick so i thought some emergen - c would really help ! didn't get it anywhere close to on time . ordered this from americarx from amazon prime ( 2 - day shipping ) on september 27th . after some emails , it was eventually shipped on october 14th . didn't get it for another week . i would stay away from this vendor . i give them two stars because the product was at least what i asked for - although 3 weeks late ! about the emergen - c , this stuff is awesome . tastes good and really makes you feel better . i think raspberry is the best flavor . i would definitely recommend taking it at the first sign of feeling sick .

this doesn't really do anything for me i am a big white chocolate fan , my favorite candy bars have always been hershey's cookies n creme and halloween kit kats ( its a white chocolate kit kat with food coloring to make the chocolate look orange for halloween ) they used to be the only way you could find white ones so this halloween i went to buy a bag and i couldn't find the white chocolate kit kats but i found these instead , and being a white chocolate fan i thought these would be amazing , i didn't have a lot of money on me so i only bought one bag - i am glad i only bought one bag , they weren't all that great . i don't think white chocolate goes all that well with peanut butter , honestly i think its like serving chicken and putting out beef gravy for your mashed potatoes in one meal , or pairing your meat with the wrong kind of wine . i found out they sell white kit kats now and its not just a seasonal thing so i have gone back to buying them and wont get these again .

change the image for chicken flavor i thought the chicken was going to be hard like chicken jerky , but instead it is completely different . the chicken is very soggy , flimsy , and smells terribly bad . plus they should change the picture for the chicken flavor , because that's not the correct bag . in the picture the chicken looks hard and tasty , but when i received this it looks completely different . i got this for my pomeranian , but he despises it . but he likes other chicken treats that look like the one in the picture . if you think your dog likes chicken flavored treats don't get him / her this one . i am rating the product on the way they display it . not on the actual treat because pomeranian's are picky . just get this . ( dogswell vitality for dogs ) . if you think their to big then break them into smaller pieces . it may be more expensive , but it's a whole lot better . i contacted zukes and they said the pictures that amazon shows are old and not updated . they told me they are supposed to be this way , but no biggie because they send me 2 replacement bags and samples of the prime venison strips , very berryz , and mean greenz dog treats . my dog likes all of the samples but not the chicken still . get the venison instead of the chicken . much better . excellent service !

customer service ? i was a blue buffalo advocate from day one when i purchased it for my dog . the ingredients were fantastic for a pet - parent who's dog is allergic to anything with corn or chicken ( which is hard to find ) . i'm a trainer at petsmart and told all of my clients about this product . this was before i had to deal with their customer service department . on my way home from work one night i realized i needed to stop and get a bag so i swung by a complete petmart and picked up a bag . i got home and realized it had been expired for almost a year . on the bag it said they guarantee their product 100 % and this guarantee means they will tell you to take it back to the store and exchange it and that it was your fault that you didn't look at the expiration date . why did i have to do the leg work for someone who is paid to check the dates ? in my petsmart , blue buffalo has a store rep who is supposed to be rotating product and she visits every week . how is this my responsibility ? they kept sending harassing e - mails and would never really answer my question as to why the store representative let a bag of what is supposed to be a high - quality brand sit there expired for almost a year . i have since switched my dog to evo and happy to report his stools are much more solid and he absolutely loves it . i'm sad the customer service for this company doesn't exist because i truly believed in their product . the only reason it got 1 star is because the first ingredient is actual meat and not a meal .

too rich i fed my champion shetland sheepdogs this food for over six months . a few of my dogs did alright on it but others had loose stools and lost on average 2 pounds from the previous year . upon giving more food to gain weight the dog's got even looser stools . i e - mailed the company about it and never got a reply . coats were shiny but not good enough for show competition . since taking my dogs off this food they have gained weight and coats are coming in to the point i can show them again soon . i do like the philosphies of this company with regards to ingredients but makes me wonder if no grain at all is such a great thing . 
=================
woohoo what a flavor . this is my first review of anything on amazon . this powder has probably the most hard to handle flavor . it is so pungent that almost nothing can cover it up . the smell is indescribable . it is impossible to cover up . it says it is supposed to help with stress , but i get more irritable drinking it . i have stopped using it for the most part and feel like i wasted money . i want to at least finish the bag . i am sure it has its benefits , and it may not be for everyone , but beware the taste . chocolate syrup is the only thing that covered it up but it took so much that it tasted like i was drinking it straight from the bottle . 
=================
acai berry . . . more than a beverage the one odd thing i noticed in reading these reviews is that everyone is treating this acai berry juice as just another beverage . it is far more than that , and that should be your main motivation in drinking this juice . i have drank acai berry ( the expensive brand and this brand ) off and on for years . the health benefits are many . . . weight loss , improved brain function , joint pain relief huge increase in energy and more . . . try it . . you won't regret it ! 
=================
i like that it is vegan , but hate that it has a boring flavor i tried the rocky road flavor and while it is not awful , it is nothing to rave over . when something is described as a " sinfully healthy snack " , i expect it to taste magical and leave me in awe that it only has 140 calories . these small bars are not decadent or sinfully healthy . they taste like unsweetened no - bake cookies to an extent and have a slight vitamin aftertaste that frequently accompanies protein and nutrition bars . inside the bar , i found a couple of nuts but everything else melded together and if it were a blind taste test , i would never guess them to be rocky road inspired . nutritionally , i don't think this bar is great . for a small 140 calorie bar , it has a good deal of fat ( 8g ) and sugar ( 9g ) . if you insist on trying these and they are out of stock here , you can get your halo bar fix on iherb . com . you can use code lek375 for a discount . this product is made in the united states .

will never buy a different brand again i used to get these from sam's wholesale club , but with this economy , i have not renewed my membership . . so long story short , i bought bumblebee canned clams and they were horrible . . so then i bought geisha baby clams and they were not as horrible , but i certainly would not put them in my clam chowder , so i returned all the unopened cans of bumblebee and geisha and am never ever gonna buy them again . . . oh , you go right ahead and try those other brands if you don't mind eating poop . . 'cause that's about all you get . . clam juice , and clam poop . doxee snow's clams are all clams and clam juice no clam poop .

good food , wrong product ! ! ! i ordered this for my 7 month old who loves this food . i ordered the 4 . 22 oz pack of 16 , but received 3 . 5 oz pack of 14 . i'm about to return it and ask for the correct product to be sent , but had i not looked closely , i would've just accepted this . just be careful and make sure you're getting what you ordered . it says it comes from amazon , but i'm wondering if there's a happy baby problem as well . . . the nutrition facts on the box don't match the nutrition facts on the pouch for the same 3 . 5oz serving . for example , the box says there's 100 % daily value of vitamin c while the pouch says 27 % . i'm wondering if anyone else sees any discrepancies ? i would think this would be illegal ?

maxwell house ok , but tastes like maxwell house . does not have the rich flavor i expect from a bold . lacks complexity and depth that i would expect from a specialty coffee .

swanson vs apricot power apricot kernels why do you want apricot kernels ? if you want to lower your blood pressure , have a healthy snack . . . swanson kernels are fine for that . if you want kernels to treat cancer you need apricot power kernels . apricot power kernels are very bitter compared to swanson's . 
=================
actual sugar i love this gum . it's one of the few ( or only ) non - xylitol or similar sugar free ingredient based gums . that stuff gives me a stomach ache ( and worse ) so i can't chew anything that has it . luckily there's still freshen - up . this gum is still made with real sugar and is pretty close to the gum you may remember having as a kid . finding an ingredient listings online has proven difficult , but not impossible . the following is off my pack : ingredients : sugar , glucose syrup , gum base , invert sugar , ( some packs contain glycerin , my current case does not list it ) , artificial and natural flavoring , soy lecithin , red 40 lake and bht ( to maintain freshness ) . contains sulfites . made in brazil , distr . by cadbury brasil industria [ . . . ] / cadbury adams usa llc ( that's an abbreviated version of the distribution companies , but i like to know where things come from before i buy them , maybe you do too . ) i hope this flavor ( and brand ! ) will always be available . i've also bought the spearmint which is very tasty but not bubble gum . the kid in me can't help blowing bubbles sometimes and that's not possible with the other flavors .

beware of the recent price increases i have ordered several cases of similac sensitive from amazon . our baby went through several formulas before we found similac sensitive and she has been on it for several months now . i tried the powdered formula version of similac sensitive but the taste is different enough that my daughter went on a " milk strike " . i have been able to buy this off amazon for under $ 30 in the past with the subscribe and save discount but now i notice that the base price is more than $ 40 . its now cheaper for me to buy it off target or walmart ( even with the sales tax ) . i may still stick with amazon for the convenience of free home delivery but this may change .

didn't like the taste ; high protein / grain free = issues my family recently adopted a 15 lb . chihuahua mix who was found abandoned . . . we didn't know what she had eaten beforehand , but i'm guessing it wasn't anything high - quality due to the condition of her teeth and coat . my goal was to get her on a high - quality diet ( a " 6 / 6 " rating ) , and researched high protein / grain free diets and the benefits of them . additionally , i read up on innova / evo and understood that their products are extremely high quality , and someone else on a forum recommended we try the red meat small bite kibble with her . even at first sniff , my dog indicated she didn't like it . of course , i figure it would take some time , so i worked on transitioning her off of the other kibble she was on . it basically came down to the fact that she would only eat the innova evo when it was mixed in with some wet food , and oftentimes only with a bit of cottage cheese mixed in . shortly after being on this high - protein diet ( we didn't even finish her small bag of food ) , she began to urinate around the house , which she hasn't done in the 5 months we've had her . it turns out she had urinary crystals , which the vet attributed to the high protein levels of her diet . we had to put her on flagil , and the vet recommended i put her on hill's science diet c / d ( which i know is full of corn and grain fillers ) . after politely declining , i changed her diet to something more holistic that does have grain ( a " 4 / 6 " rating ) . she's fine now . . . innova / evo is an extremely high quality brand . . . perhaps it's better for larger and very active dogs . i know not all dogs may have this reaction to a high - protein diet , but i really think people need to understand that high - protein / no grain isn't always the smartest choice in terms of your dog's health . in our case , it turned out to be much more costly for us and more stressful for our dog to make this switch . 
=================
hm , so so hard to get the timing for these right , and plus they have a funny smell . i am not buying them anymore . 
=================
not my favorite . the seasoning is good , but the texture is not to my liking ; it's almost spongy , and microwaving did not improve the texture for me . it is a little too dry and chewy , and has a weird aftertaste . i have not tried the other versions of this jerky . if you prefer a dry and chewy veggie jerky , i would go with the vegan dream brand . they have a sampler pack , with 6 different flavors . also , as i follow weight watchers online , the 1 . 5 oz package has 4 points , with 8 grams of fat , 152 calories , 3 grams of fiber . there are lower calorie veggie jerkies available , if that is a concern for you . 
=================
the best sunbutter ever ! ! ! i love this stuff ! ! ! it is so much better than any other brand we have tried . probably because it is roasted and has sugar in it , while the other brands are mostly raw . i'm sure the raw versions are healthier , but in this case , i consider it an indulgence ! another reason that we prefer this over any other " sun - butter " is that it comes in a glass jar , while all the other sun - butters seem to come in plastic jars . i like the flavor of this even better than almond or cashew butter . when i could find the once again sunflower seed butter locally , i would stir in coconut oil and that made it even yummier ! unfortunately my local grocery store stopped carrying it a while ago , and the shipping is rather expensive to order it direct from once again . i wish amazon would start carrying it ( not just through a sub - seller ) . update : i originally wrote this feb 2011 , and now once again is labeling their sunbutter as gluten free ! i knew that it was gf , but i'm glad to see it on the label too ! still hoping amazon will offer it with a subscribe and save option however , and bring the price down !

what's that smell ? i waited anxiously for this to arrive . the afternoon it came , i made a cup right away . a faint smell , similar to sewer gas or rotten egg smell , permeated my kitchen . since the kitchen is next to the laundry room , i thought maybe it was a sewer smell . but once i started sipping my new coffee , i realized it's the coffee . it smells only faintly , but it's such a repulsive smell i had to dump the rest of the cup . i am quite bummed that i have 2 boxes of this stuff . i think i will buy a bottle of kahlua , and add a splash to a cup of this stuff . maybe that will help me get through the 47 more kcups i have . i read all these reviews on this site , and half the people seem to love the coffee ( and not get a bad odor ) . . . the other half seem to get the bad odor and hate the coffee . are there 2 suppliers , with differing ingredients ? i strongly , strongly recommend trying to get a sample of this before shelling out the money for a full box of these kcups . 
=================
good seeds , but beware if you have a milk allergy i've tried david , spitz , and biggs sunflower seeds before giving the giants brand a try . the seeds are large and the flavoring is not too intense or too light . so the seeds taste good and are of a good quality . i haven't noticed much in the way of plant debris or empty seeds . i must give this product four stars for two reasons : 1 . unlike the spitz seeds , you cannot reseal these bags after opening them . spitz uses resealable bags for their seeds . giants does not . this means you have to eat the seeds quickly or else they will get stale . 2 . in this variety pack , several of the flavors use milk as an ingredient . specifically , the zesty italian , dill pickle , and dakota ranch flavors list milk as an ingredient . the dakota ranch flavor also lists cheese as an ingredient . there was no way of knowing this based on the product advertisement . i tried the zesty italian flavor and now have a stomachache because of the milk ingredient . i had high hopes for these seeds . they do taste good , but if you are allergic or sensitive to certain ingredients or wish to have a resealable bag , i would recommend spitz over giants , but giants over biggs and biggs over david .

new universal grow pods are awful i have had several aerogardens over the last four years . i recently purchased two new 7 pod gardens ( pro 100 ) . up to this time i was a satisfied customer albeit you have to either read up on what grows best or just practice a lot . recently i received new universal grow pods that are supposed to fit in all the aerogarden models . despite what customer service says they do not fit well in my 7 pod . worse is that the new grow pods do not hold the grow medium near the top of the pod . the new universal pods promote mold and rot and discourage germination . up to this point i would have highly recommended this product but not now or until they create a better grow pod .

warning ! taste burnout likely i had not had a slim jim in 3 years . i brought these to quench my childhood thirst for this snack . i ate all 100 of them in about 18 days . i don't want to see another slim jim ever again in my life . the product was good though so no complaints .

did i get cheated ? i read the reviews , and being a novice gardener ( was one of my chores as a kid , a very long time ago ! ) , i bought - - but no gnats ! i wouldn't know a gnat if i met one , but i encountered nothing moving , and my plants are still in good shape .

=================
cherry pie ok , choco cherry not so much . i have food allergies , and while i am looking for a chocolate fix , i think this will take a bit to get used to . the cherry pie is quite good , and tastes like the center of a fig newton . the chocolate cherry , however smells like vinegar , and while at first the flavor is fine , it soon turns into bitter cherry , a bit of a rum flavor and then you guessed it , a strong vinegar like after - taste . i can get used to it , as frankly i have no other options due to milk and soy allergies , but some sweeter cherries and maybe some organic molasses in the mix would not hurt , maybe a bit of almond oil for added sweet flavor . next time i will try the plain chocolate as i hear they get good reviews . over all , the cherry pie gets an 8 out of 10 , but the choco - cherry gets a resounding 2 . 
=================
it's kind of sweet this flavor wasn't too bad . i like sweet tasting drinks , and this is very sweet . i kind of reminds me of a strawberry jolly rancher . my 15 yr . old son tried some too , and said that he liked it as well . i just don't like the price . i think it is too expensive for such a small can .

nescafe bring back the flavored coffee canisters ! i know there are many people who want taster's choice instant vanilla and hazelnut coffee to be manufactured in the canisters once again . if you are tired of paying so much for a box of 20 sticks , call nescafe at 1 - 800 - 505 - 2876 and let them know !

misinformation in description the water is very good , though i agree with other reviews that the price is high and a different variety of flavors would be welcome . however , the description of the product says there are twelve 16 - ounce bottles , which is correct , but the breakdown given indicates it comes with 4 each of the four flavors instead of 3 each . a small but glaring mistake ! hint essence water variety pack , 16 - ounce bottles ( pack of 12

slightly medicinal taste i tried this as a cheap alternative for choffy but i found that these cacao nibs have an unpleasant medicinal taste . i've prepared it straight up and mixed with coffee . my usual method is to grind it in a coffee grinder and then brew it in a french press . after it's brewed i mix it 50 / 50 with frothy milk that i've made with a bodum milk frother , bodum chambord milk frother . choffy and coffee is a great combination , the navitas cacao and coffee isn't .

enzyme oral hygiene chews i cannot attest to the results purported yet by this product but my cats love them . our younger male cat , 3 years , especially loves them and will gnaw on a whole one of these 'treats' . he even got into the bag when we were gone and ate 5 ! the other cats did not seem interested because they are ridiculously large almost 2 " x 0 . 5 " . the are wrapped in a wafer paper like material with a flaky , wafery , crumbly , stuff inside . to feed the other cats , i applied pressure to the wafer and rolled it back and forth between my fingers to break it out of the 'shell' . i do this and add it to their food or put it separately on their plate like an side dish in addition to their wet meal and they love it , go nuts for it . i associate it with / like brushing our teeth after we eat . they eat their main course , have dried bonito flakes on the side , and then have a side of these flaky chews ( not really chews at all , like a crepe rolled up tight ) . i have only recently made this purchased and started using this product so cannot provide evidence for , or against , the claims of the product regarding pet hygiene and dental health but will post an update later in time . is it weird i kinda like the smell of them . . . ?

can't make it taste good enough for a serious trial i can't tell you if this works as a diuretic , because it tastes so bad , i can't make myself drink enough of it for a decent trial . somebody must like it or they wouldn't keep making it , but it's not for me .

awesome i got my bonsai today but am kind of disappointed when i took it out of the box . it is a small tree and got a few leaves and look like it is drying out . i am not just sure if this was a result of being in the box for a few days or the seller sent it to me as i got it . when i ordered it i paid for expadite shipping but had to wait for 9 days before i got it . i am just greatly disappointed and won't buy from sheryls shop again . i am really frustrated and regret buying from them as i found out that they got this item from another seller . jan 26 , 2012 : i would like to update my review and am happy about the seller's action on replacing the bonsai . i got the replacement today and they replaced the old one with much better one . the new one has a lot of leaves as the picture shown and it looked healthy . so i replaced my rating from 1 star to 5 star .

what is not to love about them ? i grew up in germany in a rather poor household , the rare moment there was enough money to getsweet extras like gummibears where rare and far apart . imagine how happy i was when i found out that there are gumibears , and even the one and only haribo are available in the us ! funny is , that most of the gummy you find in the us are made in turkey ( haribo is an old german company ) . i really dont mind where they make them as long as there are as yummy as they were when we were kids . unfortunately , the ones i got weren't that fresh . i dont say there were old , or bad . but do you know what i mean ? a fresh bear , is soft , feels almost wet . . yumm . . these were , a bit dry on the outside not as soft and just not as yumm . but still enjoyable . unfortunately i went trough only half the pack , then i found out that i am diabetic . . . not a fault of the gummi bears .

top sirloin steak review received two gifts of omaha steaks for christmas and anxiously looked forward to a holiday meal of steak , twice - baked potatoes and apple tartlets . however , the steaks were tough and very disappointing - the potatoes and tartlets were delicious . my anticipation for future meals is now quite diminished . i will , most definitely , share my experience with the gift givers . ins't that a shame ?

i can't believe the price i happened upon this item by accident when looking at coffee makers . while i feel eight o'clock columbian is great coffee i can't believe anyone would pay this price for it . i just purchased four bags for ten dollars ( $ 10 . 00 ) at my local giant food store asit is on sale at two for the price of one . i always stock up when they have this sale which happens every few months .

great product . super slow shipping this product , starbucks via , is a starbucks product . it's good stuff . i live in seattle , the home of starbucks . this price was cheaper than anywhere i've found for this quantity so i ordered . i thought it would take a few days to get here in a plastic envelope . nope , 12 ( twelve ) days later it arrived and was shipped from tennessee with a packing slip with the official starbucks maiden on the invoice . come on , starbucks , does all of your roasted coffee ship to your coffee shops from the same location . . . . . no distribution centers or anything that could mail a package a little more efficiently . 12 days from time of order to receipt is a long time for a package . i mail letters from seattle to the southeast every week that arrive in 3 days . this was slower than media mail .

price hike - yikes inflation of 23 . 5 % in 3 months ! ! ! ! just ordered some more of these on my subscribe and save - but somehow seemed a little pricier than i remember at $ 20 . 25 for 6 , lo and behold , checked my history and found out that the order placed : september 10 , 2011 was for order total : $ 16 . 40 , that's a hike of 23 . 5 % in 3 months ! ! ! !

good shipping , but not the flavor i was expecting ( wintergreen soda more than rootbeer ) this rootbeer extract is unlike any i've ever had before . . very heavy on the wintergreen notes ! i think its possible that i might have gotten a bad bottle , i've tried a number of different ratios to try and make something thats drinkable but i gave up after six attempts !

doesn't work use traps i tried the repellent and gas bombs , the only thing that worked were the traps . you have to dig a hole but if you don't kill the gophers they will destroy your yard so a hole is no big deal . i used the sweeney gopher traps , they worked great sweeneys 9013 gopher trap , 2 - packas a follow up we have killed all the gophers on our 5 acres ( at least the active ones ) , we did this in 3 days . we spent 3 months trying repellents and gas bombs .

had no problem . they like this one a lot i wondered why my 10 - month olds liked this one so much when the other reviews weren't so promising . then i noted that it has twice the calories as the green bean casserole and sweet ingredients that are proven winners with my kids . here's the ingredient list : water , organic carrots , organic mango puree , organic finely ground chicken , organic whole grain brown rice flour , organic yellow split pea flakes , calcium carbonate . anything that starts with carrots and mango is going to be fairly sweet , and this one is sweet . the consistency seemed very normal , perhaps because it has plenty of water - that's the first ingredient . unlike most earth best flavor brands , this one has calcium . the stated amount is 35 % of their daily needs . i've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult . i recommend this particular one , chicken mango risotto , because i think babies will tend to like it as mine did . these cases are being delivered to my home constantly , different varieties of earth's best subscriptions . on occasion a case will arrive in a mess with one or more broken jars . over time i figured out it would cost the vendor too much to package these jars well enough to ensure no breakage . now when a case arrives with one or more broken jars , i report it and can get credited for the broken ones only . of course it's messy when a jar is broken , but i don't have a store nearby that sells this product except one that lists it at a higher price .

not as advertised i just received my order of 100 count regular bully sticks and am extremely disappointed . " only valuepetsupplies bulk bully sticks are hand measured for consistent thickness " . i beg to differ . the " regular " size is quoted as 9 / 16 " thickness . the product i received is less than 4 / 16 " in thickness . out of 100 pieces , less than five actually measured up to the regular thickness advertised . my blue heeler dispatched one piece in less than a minute . it usually takes him five minutes . on the other hand , my toy fox terrier is still working on hers and won't leave leftovers for the big guy to clean up . while i understand that valuepetsupplies . com sponsors good causes , i will be spending an extra 15 cents per piece and get a much more substantial treat .

great value , but makes dog sick i bought this product because it is a great deal , rawhides in any brick and mortar store are outrageous , so i was very excited about this deal . however ; this product makes my dog throw - up , and i know its not just rawhides in general because i have given her other ones with no difficulty . i also noticed she is not as interested in these rawhides as she has been in past brands ( although this is not an issue because they as getting thrown either way . i have not contacted the seller about this yet but will be in the next couple days . i contacted amazon and they had great customer service and said they would look into the issue .

made my heart pound ? i bought this tea at stop and shop and it clearly has warnings on it but i didn't expect it to cause like a panic attack or something uncomfortable like my heart to beat loudly as it was audible . i don't fancy the flavor of this tea . yogi makes a sampler with this one in it .

wanted to like this stuff , but hurt wifey's tummy i love that it is american made from renewable sources ( birch trees ) , and the taste is great ( better than splenda or stevia ) - - absolutely indistinguishable from sugar . however , a couple of days of use had my wife cramping and a bit distressed in the nether regions . now the canister stands a bit sadly unused ( hey , don't look at me - - i like sugar ! ) .

eauction i'm in afghanistan and using amazon to find a good deal on m & ms to share with my troops . after finding the " good deal " at eauction my bill arrived in a separate email indicating that the mailing costs were more than the two bags of m & ms . this is totally ridiculous when the cost to ship to an apo address is minimal these days through usps . this has got to be nothing less than a company screwing it's potential customers . i would not recommend this seller to anyone purchasing from a military account .

when it works , its great . we have had it less than three months . we have to descale about once a week . our water has 1 gram of hardness . almost perfect . they have sent new water reservoir ( which by the way keurig has great help line ) . but , honestly for the money the mr . coffee is better . you just have to add the water each time . but it works each time . it is very hard to get a consistent full cup of coffee out of this keurig machine .

great expectations - unfortunate ending we have been purchasing wine kits locally for several years and recently began purchasing from amazon as our local source closed shop - until we processed this kit we have never had a bad batch - color was good , but there was a distinct odor and sharp taste to the finished product - the batch was scrapped .

my cat said , " no way ! " so , i bought this product to help my cat take a pill . it was the chicken flavor . it seemed like a nice alternative to using pill pockets . he ate the very first pill and that was it . i tried a few more times and it was almost as if he did not even recognize the product as food . i tried to email the company about the " flavor guaruntee " and the email was returned as undeliverable . bummer . . . honestly , my best alternative to help with pills are a product called , " lean treats " . i cut the pill into smaller pieces and break the treats in half . he likes these the best .

fresh , flavorful , and hexane - free i've tried a few different brands of extra - virgin coconut oil , and for the most part i'm equally satisfied with them all . despite the marketing hype , coconut oil brands within each category ( virgin , refined , hydrogenated ) are very similar . i should specify the qualities i look for in a coconut oil : i want a coconut oil with a rich coconut aroma and taste , maximum nutrition , and minimal processing . for these reasons , i always select an organic , extra - virgin , cold - pressed oil . i'm pleased that this nutiva organic extra - virgin coconut oil provides these qualities along with an easy - to - find " packed on " and " best before " date . the jars i ordered in late january 2011 were packed on september 13 , 2010 , and the " best before " date is september 13 , 2012 . stored correctly ( cool , dark location , no refrigeration needed ) , this nutrient - dense oil stays fresh for two years . it smells and tastes great - - coconutty and slightly sweet . according to nutiva , no hexane is used in the processing of this oil . hexane is a petroleum - derived solvent used in all kinds of industrial applications , from shoe manufacturing to roofing . interestingly , because hexane's primary molecular structure is carbon , it can be passed off as " organic . " do a little research ; " cold - pressed , " " organic , " and " hexane - free " are key considerations when selecting your coconut oil for nutrition purposes . i'm not as pleased with the plastic jars . in fact , i took off a star as a result of the plastic packaging . i feel that a quality organic oil should be stored in a glass jar , and ideally a dark one to reduce oxidation . i've actually selected coconut oils specifically because they come in glass jars , and might have bypassed this product if i hadn't found it on sale at a good price . i put this information in the review to aid those of you who are looking for a coconut oil in a glass jar . of course , at this larger size , you might prefer a plastic jar to eliminate some of the weight , but for storage purposes , glass might be best .

egg whites are not recommended for babies under a year old my 10 month old daughter is eating chunky foods such as this and table foods that are appropriate for her . this gerber lasagna with meat sauce states that it is appropriate for crawlers ( babies usually crawl way before hitting the one year mark ) . yet in the ingredients states that it contains egg whites , which are not recommended for babies under a year old . i'm glad i read the label before serving it to her ! i asked my daughter's pediatrician at her 9 month check up about this and was told never to give a baby egg whites in any form , until after a year , as it is known to trigger severe allergic reactions . otherwise , i love gerber 3rd stage foods for my 10 month old , she gobbles them up . but we will hold off on this flavor until she's a year old .

this is trash . this is not food . check out the nutrition facts right below the product name on the amazon page . is the manufacturer hoping that uninformed consumers have heard the word omega somewhere and think that it's necessarily good for them ? nature's path does not tell us which omega 6s or omega 3s it contains . beneficial omega 3s are those that we get from foods such as tuna and flax . omega 6s are generally what we get from corn - fed stockyard beef . or from sitting down and swigging a bottle of peanut oil . note that this product contains 900 mg of omega 6s and 400 mg of omega 3s . more than twice as much of omega 6s as omega 3s . the typical , god - awful american diet contains a ratio of 20 : l omega 6s to omega 3s . nutritional scientists recommend that we drop this diet and try to get at least a 3 : 1 ration of omega 3s to omega 6s . large studies are indicating that omega 3s help the cardiovascular system , reduce inflammation , may have a helpful role in preventing cancer , improve depression in some people and may possibly be helpful in preventing or stabilizing some forms of dementias . are these studies far enough along to be conclusive ? no . are they pointing us in some healthy directions ? yes . are positive results encouraging more studies - not just lab studies , but human studies ? yes . the most positive results so far indicate that omega 3s are very good for our hearts . so , you get 2 grams of fiber from a product that supposedly contains granola , flax seed , raisins , hemp seeds and sunflower seeds . what are they using these fiber - rich foods for ? the box ? you also get 100 mg of sodium and 14 - fourteen - grams ! of sugar , along with some saturated fat . i've been looking for healthy snacks for my pregnant daughter and i'm shocked to see that there is no nutritional value in any of the bars produced by nature's path organic . i decided to check out nature's path cereals , etc . , and found the same garbage . the words organic , nature and nutrition have been prostituted by a lot of greedy companies , but this is the most egregious example i've seen in a while . i'd like to see amazon pull these products - if we stop buying them and the market disappears - so will the products . in the meantime , we need to keep educating ourselves and sharing what we learn . we need to keep up pressure on the grocery stores , supermarkets , food banks and places we go when we can't to get to or afford our co - op . we need to keep ourselves , our children , our grandchildren and our neighbors healthy , well - nourished and strong . best to all .

 $ 22 . 25 for 8 cans i love boysenberries , blackberries and mulberries . mm , mm mm , the darker the gentler . the light syrup is not too sweet so i don't mind spooning it in along with the berries . the berries are mushier than firm but not mush and still somewhat shapely . it was not difficult to finish a can .

favorite candy but not happy when i received them . these are my favorite candy ! i decided that , when i went to a local candy store here and they wanted to charge me $ 1 . 00 a box , that i needed to just order my own for cheaper ! the shipping was very quick . however , when i received them , they're all broken ! i opened numerous boxes and all are in pieces . i couldn't find one full candy cigarette . on top of that , they are hard as rocks ! definitely not the delicious candy that i know and love . these were disgusting . i will not be ordering from here again . 
=================
no hydrogenated oils , but too sweet i love that this is a no - stir option without hydrogenated oils . i really hate stirring natural peanut butter . plus , oily peanut butter - yuck ! my only issue is that it's far too sweet . i got used to peanut butter without sugar . i also think the company is being a little deceptive . they say that there's " no added sugar , " but then admit in the description that there's cane juice . the carb count , for anyone who's interested , is 8 grams ( 3 grams of which are sugar ) per 2 tablespoons . whether it's cane juice or sugar or corn syrup , it's really all sugar . because of the over - sweetening and higher carb count , i probably won't be ordering from this company again , but if they ever make a no - stir peanut butter without any kind of sugar , i'll be the first in line . fortunately , i was able to turn the peanut butter into low - carb peanut butter cookies . the sweetness doesn't bother me as much in cookie form .

boo i say . tabasco lies . first off , allow me quote the label . " tabasco habanero sauce is made from the world's hottest pepper . " what ? ! that's funny , i don't see the word 'jolokia' nor 'scorpion' anywhere in the ingredients . how is it legal to make such a blatantly false claim ? false advertising aside , i bought a bottle for thirty - five cents at my local grocer after it was on sale and had a coupon which doubled . the moment came and i shook the bottle into my mouth for a swig . . and . . . nothing . minutes later , another big swig ; a third of the bottle now gone . i waited patiently to no avail . maybe others would have been impressed with the hint of capsaicin , but not me . so , thankfully i didn't pay much for this tiny bottle of disappointment . maybe ithe positive reviewers drank a whole gallon and that's where i went wrong . yes , i am a shu snob , and if you need to look up what " shu " is , then this sauce is for you . even tabasco's website , which doesn't require a recall to correct , is loaded with inaccurate [ read deceitful ] claims . i've had hotter jalapenos from domino's pizza than tabasco's attempt at a habanero sauce . stick with the simple pickled red pepper juice and market your black pepper water toward the mainstream tabasco ; you're way out of your league . that said , this sauce is great for adding to baking soda and making cool volcanos with my kids . certainly not worthy of gracing my breakfast . but hey , this is just my opinion . much like tabasco's opinion on " the world's hottest pepper " ; no real merit . worth noting , this is only the second time i've ever been compelled enough by a product to take the time which i have little of to share my opinion .

a little bit different type of mini wheat . when mini - wheats first came out in the grocery store , i tried them . however , i found they were bland . it was like trying to eat sticks in milk . then came " frosted " mini - wheats . okay , i decided to give it a go . now i had sticks and sugar in milk . however , i did find out that if you forego the milk and just eat them straight from the box , like potato chips , they are excellent ! now kellogg's has added fruity flavors to the mini - wheat . these i can eat in milk ! yippee ! finally ! i picked up the " strawberry delight " in bite size . even though i can eat them in milk , i find that i still prefer just to eat them straight from the box , like potato chips , a type of chex - mix , or square wheat thin snack . each serving has 140 calories . compare that to other cereals and you'll see it is about 60 - 100 calories less . no saturated fat . no trans fat . no cholesterol . no sodium . total fat is only 0 . 5g according to the box . i don't see how , since zero and zero is , well , zero . but i can live with 0 . 5g . here is the bad news , the carbohydrates . there are 35g of carbs here . but that is about the same as all the other brands . diabetics may want to pass on this due to the 10g of sugar per serving . and remember , a single serving is about the size of half a base ball . not much . so if you are just pouring cereal into a " cereal bowl " without measuring , you are probably getting 2 or 3 servings in that one bowl . all - in - all , unless you are diabetic , this mini - wheat is terrific ! reviewed by detra fitch of huntress reviews .

rook not trilled maybe sad . there were 28 coffees and 7 teas nothing else . i thought i'd get a selection . i wanted to try cocoa and apple cider but as many here have said there is no variety . there were 35 different products both dark coffee and medium . there were 6 flavored coffees and 4 decaf coffees . but not the wide variety i had expected . also although i have not used the product yet , as i have not been delivered the coffee maker , i'm wondering how they will taste as the cups are old . several of them are puffed up . i don't think they will be poison , but old coffee is not flavorful . don't buy this product or maybe you're just into russian roulette . just went from 2 stars to 1 . i ordered the bed bath and beyond 60 samples for $ 39 . 00 , and while their selection was just ok , a 3 . 5 star rating . its . 66c a k - cup while this is . 75c , bb & b's selections where fresher and there was some variety . ok i ordered more so the price was better but let me tell you the whole presentation was better , the product was better , fresher and i think it has this beat by 2 . 5 stars .

better choice at rate charged per ounce of brazilian nuts compare the price per ounce before buying your brazil nuts , this brand is less expensive , less packaging hype since you are buying what is inside the package and not some package appearance . other brands listed at amazon are presumed to not taste any better since they all are imported from same sources anyways . my advice buy this brand even though packaging looks alittle plain .

this gum is really great ! if you have problems with aspartame ( which is in every gum out there . . . not just sugarfree gums ) and you love to chew gum then steviadent is really the only option unless you want to eat tictacs . it is really good although quite expensive , but completely worth it to me so as not to compromise my health . i chewed every gum out there and lots of it , but had recently started to notice a painful lump on the roof of my mouth . my immediate reaction was . . . of course cancer , but i had 2 dentists and an oral surgeon check it out and all confirmed it was not . not only that , aspartame upset my stomach to the point that i had an extreme amount of bloating and gas every day . i didn't initially attribute either of these things to aspartame , but when i started to notice the lump was bigger and more painful upon chewing my old gum , i started doing my research and aspartame turned out to be the culprit . i ended up ordering a case of the steviadent and pitched everything i owned that contained asapartame . the lump on the roof of my mouth disappeared within 2 days of not ingesting aspartame and my stomach bloating and gas completely went away . worth spending the extra $ until more gums start making their product with stevia instead of aspartame .

high in sugar and carbs / low in protien while this protien shake is one of the better tasting i've had , it's not a real protien shake . this only has 10grams of protien compared to most shakes that have about 30g and up . the real " keep away " factor for me is that this shake has 29 g of carbs / 18 g of this is sugar . if you're serious about weight loss , there are much better protien shakes on the market . try eas whey protien - it comes in a bag and each serving contains 170 calories / only 3 grams of carbs and 30g of protein . i haven't tried chocolate but vanilla is very tasty , especially with ( skim ) or almond milk . in response to a user comment , yes this product is marketed as an " appetite suppressor " rather than protein shake - however , if you're trying to lose weight - you will need to avoid sugary products , such as this . spring for a protein shake with more protein and less sugar . the eas whey protein will not taste as good - special k drinks do taste much better - that is for sure ( 18 grams of sugar ! ) . sometimes as a 'treat' i will take 1 scoop eas whey protein ( chocolate ) , 1 banana , 1 cup almond milk and 1 cup ice - blend well in a blender - and you have a delicious and healthy protein shake .

our dogs now call them " puke's " ( this review was written by our dog , who isn't 13 , ( she's only two ) so she really isn't old enough to be allowedto write a review , but don't tell amazon ! ) they looked so darn good . and were really fun to chew on - i ate about a third of mineover a couple hrs , in different " chewing appointments " i thought . . . this is great ! then i felt kinda funny . . . and before i knew it - i threw upall over mom's rug in her officethree times . wow ! big gobs of it ! i didn't even eat that much ! it musta really swolled up in my doggie belly ! and later . . . that same afternoon . . . my sisterpup threw hers upall over the van . mom said no more zukes . dang . we kinda liked those pukes . at least til we got to thepuking part . mom was not amused .

good in a pinch if you don't have peppers in the frig and don't have time to run to the store , these will do . expensive thou with shipping cost . plan ahead and go to the store .

poor tasting i can't slam this product because the ones i recieved from amazon are very stale ( although date says good through may of 2011 ) i think from poor storage in warehouse , so with that grain of salt , i found them to have a chemical taste . but i'm sure if they were fresh it would have been better . and if i were on a gluten free diet it would be great

amount of grains correct , shipped improperly , grains appear inactive i received the promised 3 + tablespoons of milk kefir grains , but the product was shipped in a plastic tub that had nothing , like tape , to keep it closed during shipment . as a result the product arrived in a plastic lined shipping envelope , but the plastic container had come open and what ( if any ) liquid was shipped with the product had spilled out along with the grains , inside the envelope , with only a few grains remaining in the plastic tub . simply adding some cellophane tape or shipping tape around the edges of the plastic tub lid / container would likely have kept the product contained properly during shipping . also the package was hot when it arrived . the grains " looked " large and healthy , if a little bit crushed , however i have tried making milk kefir 2 - 3 times since i received the product , according to the instructions included in the shipment , and the milk curdles very little , even if i leave the grains for two days , instead of just one . i'm hoping the grains are still just in shock . some grains seem to float while others sink to the bottom of the glass jar filled with fresh whole milk , that i cover using a rubber band and coffee filter , so the mixture can breath at room temperature away from any direct light . also the grains were in large clumps in the shipment or appeared to be , but now have broken down to much smaller clumps . the color of the grains is close to the color of milk . i'm hoping the grains that sink to the bottom aren't dead or totally inactive , but most milk kefir makers seem to indicate their grains float on the surface or the milk . i'll try making milk kefir for one more week , but if the milk still isn't curdling , then i'm afraid these grains arrived dead / inactive and likely never will become active . any buyers should be forewarned that the seller wants you to pay return shipping for a full refund and says they will not reimburse you for this cost , and this must happen within one week of receiving the product . i purchased water kefir grains from another seller that were shipped with liquid in a totally sealed plastic bag , that arrived unbroken - they have been making water kefir successfully in the same environment , so i'm certain that the environmental conditions are not a problem , also those water kefir grains have since doubled in volume ( grown ) . i am not using metal utensils , only plastic , nylon , or glass ( jars , strainers ) . it's now september 16 , 2012 . i had to give up on getting these milk kefir grains to work properly ( or at all ) . my water kefir grains i had received from another seller are now busting at the seems in productivity . they went from 3 - tablespoons to 2 . 5 quarts of water kefir grains by this time . i found a website that told you how to gradually convert water kefir grains to milk kefir grains , and using this technique i now have very effective working milk kefir / milk kefir grains . they don't grow as fast as the water kefir grains , but they do product milk kefir that's delicious and viable .

from someone who grew up on coconut milk / water ! ! ! ! ! i ordered two to try out from amazon but while waiting on the delivery , i was out shopping when i observed a lot of companies were suddenly cashing out on coconut milk / water ! i bought one brand - name from lucky's super market and another brand from walgreen's next door . being of polynesian heritage and homegrown from the islands but living on the mainland , i thought , " hmmm . . all these centuries coconuts been around , suddenly its being pitched as nutritional & interesting . let's see what the catch is " . finally , vitacoco came . i tasted it and spit it right out . it didnt taste like coconut water to our family 'at all' , not even from an over - ripe coconut . then i looked to see where it was produced . before i go further let me explain something to those who may not know . agriculture for fruits are always better on tropical islands , or from the caribbean islands . you won't find any fruits more richer in juice or sweeter anywhere else in the world . vita coco says it is produced by a company in latin america , brazil . produced for all markets inc . new york , ny . my sister then poured some into a glass and screamed , " omg they're ripping people off ! it's watered down ! " she said that because pure coconut milk has a milky color to it . some less , some more but never crystal clear . the younger the fruit , the richer , more nutritional , and milky the coconut milk . the more mature the fruit , the sweeter & thinner the milk . as the fruit ripens the coconut water gets converted into the solid meat of the fruit . the meat then becomes more nutritional then the milk . so i told her that they weren't ripping consumers off because it says , 100 % pure coconut water . it's either a little coconut milk diluted with a lot of pure water , or this is what brazilian coconuts taste like . and it seems like they're using 'over - riped' coconuts . which makes sense . then they could also market the meat of the coconut . as for those who have to have potassium every night like my aunt , do not rely on vita coco's ad . my aunt finished off the 17 fl oz of vita coco and still woke up with painful side effects from taking prednisone . this is also how we know vita coco is using over - ripe less nutritional coconuts , or watering it down . i ended up having to prepare her daily one banana she's suppose to have before bedtime . drink mango or guava juice all ! the most nutritional of all island fruits ; )

do the math : $ 5 . 70 each ! ! ! can you afford this ? be sure you understand they are asking you to give them about $ 40 for only * * 7 * * squeezies . that makes them nearly $ 6 each ! ! ! ! for fruit sauce ? ? ? there are several other brands which offer the same thing - - pureed fruits and vegetables in soft squeezy packages that can be sucked out by toddlers in carseats - - and they are selling for around $ 35 for * * * 24 * * * packages of squeezies . see that difference ? the stuff tastes just as good , i've tried them . in fact , the broccoli one of ella's is disgusting , in my opinion . i like the brand that starts with a " p " , second word organics . not the bunny . these get one star for pricing . the star is given because the product is nice , but 4 stars are taken away because of the complete highway robbery of offering these in a pack of only 7 for $ 39 . 95 . don't encourage them .

clumpy . . . the mix was a little lumpy . . . had some hard chunks that would not dissolve , they were as hard as rocks and some had to be fished out of the batter . the mix was not expired , it was as if it had been exposed to moisture or improper temperatures during storage . still came out o . k . and tasted great . 
=================
good product , but beware , the recipe on the box is gross the recipe on the box has the main ingredient being 2 cups of water . i have never heard of water being the main ingredient of a pudding , it makes a watery tasteless pudding . i used this recipe that another reviewer posted¼ cup tapioca2 cups milk2 eggs1 / 3 cup sugarpinch of salt1 tsp vanillai didn't follow the cooking instructions that the other reviewer posted , i just threw it all in together ( well , except the egg , i tempered that in at the end ) and cooked it on low for about 15 min . it turned out really good , i think that this tapioca pudding would work well without the egg if you just added some more tapioca to thinken it up .

purina one sensitive - great for a cat with digestion trouble we recently took in a cat that could not keep any food down . she would throw up multiple times a day , usually within an hour or so of eating . we thought she may be overeating , so we limited how much food we gave her , we tried to spread out the food to force her to breath and chew between pieces . we tried many different foods , including multiple foods recommended by the vet . after a lot of money spent on vet visits and tests , with the vet finding nothing wrong with her , i saw this food and figured trying a food for sensitive systems couldn't hurt . we'd already tried other purina one formulas without success , so we weren't particularly optimistic , but hopeful . our cat has been eating this for about two or three weeks now and she has not thrown up at all . i love this food , it was hard to watch her throw up so much , and , frankly , it wasn't pleasant cleaning it up so frequently . i'm glad i found this and fully recommend it to anyone with a cat with similar problems keeping food down .

healthful , not too sweet hot cereal this cereal has great texture ( not over - processed ) and the portion size is generous . it also is not overly sweetened and has great flavor from the fruit . i became aware of this product through my workplace cafeteria . unfortunately , when i ordered the peach raspberry oatmeal online , i was sent onion soup instead . food items are not returnable , so i am stuck with something that i did not order .

leaking bottle one of the 6 one liter bottles was damaged at the seam and leaking ( not sealed ) therefore not safe to consume . also these bottles are somewhat short - dated compared to what you can buy in the store right now . the store expiration dates tend to be around mid - 2012 whereas these bottles expire jan 2012 .

no box - bulk splenda thought i was receiving a boxed case of splenda packets . instead i received a plastic bag of the 1000 packets . i guess if i was running a deli or restaurant wouldn't care . item is bulk splenda & not boxed case that you would find at costco or bj's . but , has worked out just not what i was expecting .

great , if you don't mind getting showered with poison . from the picture it looks like there is a new bottle with the valve on the side . the one i bought had the valve on the top . just like the other reviewer , not long after i turned on the hose , the knob popped off spraying it all over me . luckily i didn't have my face over it , only my arms and legs got covered with it . maybe it works well , but it's not worth risking your life for . 
=================
not the best cat treat in my opinion , but they are cat approved at first the only good comment i can give on these treats is that my cat liked them when they were fresh , and they are really inexpensive ! i can usually find these treats for under two dollars at the grocery or pet store , and even on occasion at the dollar store . as this treat proves , often with a low price , comes a cheap product . it would be nice if these pounce treats had healthier ingredients , maybe some vitamins or a dental cleanser , but no , its just junk food and a long list of filler ingredients . they smell really gross to me but my cat seemed to enjoy them . my biggest reason for not liking this treat , aside from the terrible ingredients and smell , is the fact that it is soft and chewy and not crunchy texture . soft treats reek havoc on pet teeth as the sticky particles just sit on their teeth and gums and just rot there . crunchy treats at least crunch off and don't stick to their teeth - hopefully crunching off some tarter with it . for a really good dental product , i recommend crunch n' clean brand with dentashield . greenies brand doesn't have as many beneficial dental ingredients , but they are pretty good as well as they contain vitamins and a little bit of breath freshening ingredients in them , so they are much better than these . any crunchy treat would be better than these . even other pounce varieties are much better than these , such as the tarter & plaque control varieties . the pounce tarter & plaque control are a bit more pricey , but still relatively inexpensive and they contain vitamins and are crunchy . another strange thing about these treats is that the recommended daily allotment is 6 - 8 treats per day , which is just crazy to me . i only give my cats no more than 1 - 2 a day of these while i had them . i eventually threw them out as they got hard as rocks and my cats didn't like them anymore anyhow . pros : cat approved taste while fresh ; and very fair pricecons : bad smell , lack of nutrition , terrible texture for teeth

tastes just like raisin bran cereal ! ! ! after reading the reviews , i was expecting this cereal to tastes like great muesli and was i wrong . it's just like raisin bran . . . . where's all of the fruit and yummy taste ? i should've been more careful before ordering this . now i have a whole caseload of this stuff . well , at least it's edible and not terrible for cereal , but it's not great for muesli for sure . 
=================
rough stuff i didn't have such luck with this product as the other reviewers - - unfortunately i got severe abdominal cramps the few times i tried it . still , it's worth a try because it works for many people . just bear in mind that if you get some bad cramping , you are probably sensitive to senna , the active ingredient in the tea . so stay away from other senna products , too . ( usually labeled " stimulant laxative . " ) so what works for me ? lots of the high - fiber foods every day . plenty of raw fruits ( except banana ) and vegetables ( two raw carrots a day works wonders ! ) whole grains every day makes a big difference - - i especially like brown rice and oatmeal . apples are yummy : i eat one every day . eating beans and legumes is also very helpful . buy some dried lentils - - they cook the fastest - - and google some soup recipes . and keep products made with white flour to a minimum . in the worst case scenario , try plain old water . both ways . nature is great .

puzzled by the negative reviews though this is my first k - cup review , let me establish my position and reasons i came to this conclusion . first , i am coffee wimp . i drink coffee only with half & half ( fat free ) and imitation sugar . second , my b40 has not yet arrived so i used my krups model 871 espresso machine to brew my k - cup which , is not all that different than the brewing process of the keurig machines . third , i gave up drinking all drinks made up or including alcohol in 1988 due to health reasons but prior to that time i had drank white russians and was very fond of them i just can't remember exactly what kahlua tasted like except it was sweet and i enjoyed them . forth , wither one likes or dislikes one k - cup over another is purely subjective and i'm not criticizing those who wrote negative review . with that established , lets move on . when i opened the kahlua k - cup i noticed a distinct sweet aroma and also a dark roasted bean odor like one might experienced from a starbucks coffee ; so being from seattle washington i'm use to that . i pealed off the lid of the k - cup and emptied it into the krups filter basket . tampered it down sightly like one would do for an espresso grind , measured about 8 ounces of water and poured that into the machine and then turned it on . when the coffee started to drip into the carafe and some steam arose i wasn't sure wither to hold my breath or hold my nose . much to my surprise i did notice an odor like from a dark roasted bean or from my espresso's i use to make , but nothing offensive . i was a bit perplexed ; again i thought of the reviewers who had complained of an offensive odor emitting from their machines during the brewing process . upon completion of the brewing cycle , i poured the coffee in my large mug added the half & half until it reached a blond - carmel like color ( but not enough to over power the coffee ) and the sweetener and took my first sip , with great anticipation . not bad was my first impression . i actually enjoyed it . it had a sweet but not to sweet flavor and to my mind , a carmel like flavor with a medium - dark roasted base of a regular coffee . no offensive taste or aroma others had written about and a pleasant after taste that lingered for some time after wards , not to strong nor acidic quite pleasant actually . my conclusion ? perhaps the other reviewers had a bad batch or this particular flavor needs to be consumed with some cream or cream like dairy product and or a sweetener . either way , i plan to continue on drinking this k - cup flavor for some time and can't wait till tomorrow to have my next cup . when my b40 arrives and i have a different result with that machine i will add an update .

excellent product ! i feed my two oldest dogs this dry food . they have no problems with it at all , even love it plain without anything added . i had to find a new high - quality food with the lowest amount of protein in it ( this has 16 % protein ) because one of my dogs had bladder stones that were removed , but she still had crystals forming in her urine afterwards , and that is what causes stones . ( i combine 1 / 2 dry and 1 / 2 wet food to decrease the amount of protein even further for her - the nasty prescription food vets recommend has 12 % protein but very bad preservatives , corn , wheat , animal digest and by - products , so i couldn't give her that food - and the other one gets 3 / 4 dry and 1 / 4 wet mixed . ) the two younger ones ( one is a puppy , the other is 2 years old ) get the wellness super5mix complete health dry dog food or the taste of the wild dry dog food mixed with 1 / 4 wet . i also add a couple of squirts of wild salmon oil to all the dogs' food as well because it is very good for them . my dogs love dinner time !

one happy buddy boy . . . . . . . . . . our mix - breed rescue dog had obviously been through a lot . 3 years of repeated & chronic ear infections ( per the few records we were able to find ) & itchy , red inflammed ( no fleas ) skin . his poor teeth are ground down to the nub , with two of the incisors broken off halfway . we were glad he has found a forever home with us ! after we paid for two expensive vet visits , two rounds of prescription antibiotics and ear drops , i knew we had to find a permanent solution , or buddy might not get to stay with us . i read online that many pet foods ( including science diet and other " higher grade " type of pet food ) have large amounts of corn , meal , or other grains as the primary ingredient . . . . . . . . often causing some of the symptoms poor buddy was having . one of the brands that was highly recommended instead was the halo brand . he tried it , and within 3 days , buddy's skin had become a normal color , and he was no longer biting his red , itchy belly or elsewhere . he was finishing up the second round of antibiotics & ear drops , so we wondered if it was the food or the consistent care ? there are chunks of vegetables ( i've seen potato , carrots , green beans . . . . . . ) in the canned food . i haven't seen any stems , but if i were dissatisfied with any of the foods , i would return them to the place i bought them for a refund . i took back a couple bags of food that were half used ( after our rescue cats were deemed to have urinary crystals & needed prescription diets ) and petco gladly refunded me the full amount . it's been over a year now , and sweet buddy has had no ear infections . we love halo pet food , and for us - it has been well worth the price . two expensive vet visits would pay for a year's worth of this food ! now - if only both my rescue cats health issues could be so easily ( and cheaply ) solved ! ( halo doesn't make a food that would help them ) .

blue was not blue . yellow and red were great . the blue turned out to be a faded shade of red - purple coming straight out of the bottle . the yellow was decent , but it's just turmeric , which is easier to do with dried turmeric alone . the red was quite brilliant . i contacted the company via email to give them my comments on the blue and unfortunately didn't receive a response .

fair aroma and flavor . not particularly fresh . i usually only buy freshly roasted beans from various online stores , but bought these on a whim while ordering some other stuff from amazon . when i received the beans , i was immediately disappointed with the bag which did not appear to be vacuum sealed very tightly . the date on the bag indicated something to the effect of " sell by 6 / 23 / 2013 " which tells me that these beans were probably roasted in june of 2012 ; it's now september , which means these beans have been sitting in the bag for 2 + months with a less - than - ideal seal . not good ! when i opened the bag and took a " whiff " , the beans smelled okay but definitely didn't have that rich chocolaty aroma that i'm used to with freshly roasted beans . the beans all have an even dark appearance with a mild oil sheen ; no burned charcoal in this bag , which is good ! i had my first cup this morning and was less than thrilled with the brewing aroma ; it again lacked the richness that i'm used to with my other blends . the flavor can be described in the same way ; it's not bad at all , but not particularly outstanding . compared to the " established " household name brand beans that you can pick up in any grocery store , cameron's organic french roast is a definite step up in flavor but it just can't compete with the roasted - to - order boutique blends . if you can manage to get these beans freshly roasted and in a tight vacuum sealed bag ( where so much air has been sucked out that the beans all leave impressions in the side of the bag ) , this may very well be an excellent coffee . as it was shipped to me . . . it's only fair . edit ( 06 - sep - 2012 ) : spelling corrections . i must have been half asleep when i typed this ! need . . . more . . . coffee . . . ! ! it's worth noting that i ground up the entire bag and brought it to my workplace for my coworkers to use in the office coffee maker ; they are accustomed to drinking long oxidized grocery - store purchased name - brand coffee ( which i refer to as " butt - blend " ) . cameron's is a real treat for their defiled palates !

many ingredients to be called a clear broth soup i was looking for a nice clear broth soup for lunch coming off of the master cleanse . i found these packets in my pantry at home . there are quite a few ingredients to be called a clear broth soup ! why add wheat and wheat gluten ? ? ? and monosodium glutamate ? now i have to look up succinic acid , sodium citrate , disodium inosinate , and disodium guanylate . looks like alot of sugar and salt . you can do better than this kikkoman . hmmm . guess i will wait until i get home to have my home made veggie broth soup .

the truvia made our whole family ill the flavor and quality cannot compare to zevia ginger ale made with erythritol and stevia but not into a mega commercial commodity . i don't know all of what they must do to " process " truvia into what it is since they don't have to disclose the process or the additives , but no comparison to just good erythritol and stevia . wouldn't have thought it would make such a difference . we will never buy any of these sodas again . all of the zevia sodas are good ( although more expensive , they are worth it ) and don't make everyone have serious intestinal pain .

high price for low quality these cookies are not of the quality i have come to expect with pamela's products . in addition , there are only 9 cookies per box . i regularly use the bread and flour packages that pamela's products produces and highly recommend them . these cookies fall short of quality . if you need to be gluten free , and in desperate need of a cookie only then would i recommend these .

mediocre wine it's good wine . everything worked out okay . i'm not impressed . but i'm not depressed . i bought the shiraz , also . little watery - lack of flavor , but it's cheap so i'll go with it . i'd advise anyone to buy this if they like cheap wine that's fun to make .

a little smaller than i thought they'd be i bought these as an alternative to other oral hygiene products based on price - probably not a great decision . the chips are a lot smaller than standard rawhide chips you might buy in a regular pet store or supermarket , and my dog ( 25 lbs . ) doesn't seem to love them . might be size - appropriate for dogs & lt ; 15 lbs .

beware over - priced ! ! ! this is the best oat bran cereal . but one star because it is over - priced ! should be less than $ 3 . 00 a box , if purchased from your local grocery store , such as harris teeter or publix . or order directly from hodgson mill website for a case with 6 boxes for a total of $ 11 . 50 , though shipping costs are high . or order from iherb website at $ 2 . 07 a box , lower shipping charges . still this is the best oat bran cereal in the market .

dried cherries i wish i was more positive , but i am not really happy with the product . i have bought traverse bay cherries in the past . these cherries have an off taste as if they have been in storage too long and are far too over plump as to suggest extra sugar has been added to increase weight . michigan cherries from traverse bay has been an excellent product in the past . i suspect these are second rate in some fashion .

tinged with vitamin c switch is a tangy drink that's more reminiscent of sprite than orange juice . it's carbonated all the way and you will even burp after it as you would've after consuming any soft drink . the drink doesn't feel sugary , but a quick glance at the nutritional facts reveals that each can contains 34 grams of sugar . the claim on the can is that there are no additional sugars added , so i'm assuming that's the sugar from the orange and tangerine . the can

toxic waste are the same as warheads toxic waste vs warheads ? they taste almost exactly the same except toxic waste has a sour core to it . lemon is the most sour flavor . for [ . . . ] you get 12 containers with 16 pieces in each . 12x16 = 196 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! . get toxic waste mainly because you get more than warheads and there is that sour core . the core however is no where near as sour as the coating on the outside . 
=================
dense texture , wheat taste the above title pretty much says almost all i need to say about this product : it has a dense texture and a wheat taste . by itself the flavor is good but not 'yummy' : i would add some oil to the crust , both to the top and the bottom , to give it a little more flavor . i don't think this product would enhance an otherwise homemade pizza , but i don't think it would detract from it either .

way too much cardamom ! i used to drink twinings india spice chai in the gold box daily and with great pleasure . it was so much better than tazo ( all ginger and vanilla ) and the other supermarket brands ( all cinnamon ) . before i found it on amazon i could only get it at the costplus / world market , but happily made the trip . it was often sold out but still worth trying for . then twinings decided to change their recipe . i think in an attempt to taste more like tazo , they took out all the subtle masala chai flavors and just dumped in a ridiculous amount of cardamom . it's literally enough to make your tongue a little numb and kills all the background flavors . the positive thing i can say is that it's still super cheap and convenient on amazon subscribe . and if you don't care about subtleties in flavor , the overload of cardamom eventually seems to kill those taste buds and it becomes less oppressive over time . not good , but less horrible . what was once a wonderful and satisfying tea experience now just gets the job done , but at the expense of all the joy : (

for a water flavorant , great . definitely not a cocktail . breaking away from my sweet tea habit was a bit of a struggle for me , and water flavoring packets like crystal light have made it much easier . i'm generally a fan of lemonade and berry flavors , but mojitos are my favorite cocktail so i decided to give these a try . i generally use part of a packet - - about 1 / 3 - - to flavor a large , 32 ounce water bottle . any less and it just tastes like slightly acidic water ( not bad , but not great ) and more tastes way to sweet . it's got a nice distinctive minty lime flavor , you can definitely tell that it's meant to be mojito flavored ! on the whole , it's very good and i'd definitely get it again as a water additive . on the other hand , it does have a bit of an aftertaste and doesn't quench thirst quite as well as plain old water . i also wouldn't use this for a cocktail base ( with water added - - i can't speak to just dumping the powder into rum ) . it just tastes really watered down ( unsurprisingly ) and certainly isn't a good substitute for actual mint , lime , and soda , unless you really like to punish yourself by imagining how good an actual cocktail is while suffering through a nasty tasting " diet " substitute . if you want a real mojito just save your calories and get one on the weekend , don't try to use this stuff !

not impressed my husband and i were excited to try them . we bought pineapple , beer , lemon , lime , hot peppers , cheese and wine . the only thing we noticed any difference in was the lemon and lime . the lemon was pretty easy to eat because it added some sweetness - it remained quite sour though . we each let one tablet dissolve on our tongue as directed so not sure what the problem was .

define southern this is not what i would call southern sweet tea . i was raised on sweet tea and this is simply iced tea . if you are looking for something that is as sweet and sugar laden as your grandmother's tea , this is not it . it is great iced tea , put some sugar in the bottom of the cup before you brew it and it can make delicious sweet tea as well . it is a great alternative to making an entire pitcher when no one else will drink it .

poorly marketed . i have to start out saying i am caucasian . this product is made for african american hair . this is basically just a tub of vaseline . i am very disappointed because i got this after reading this was for dry scalps . in the winter my head gets very dry and i can only wash my hair every 5 days or so . but when i got this home and i saw the for natural or relaxed hair on the front i knew it wasn't for me . not only that but there are no directions as to how to use it . this product just wasn't for me but was marketed like it was . i'm disappointed because i would like a product like this but i have a tub of vaseline already at home so i don't need another one . 2 stars because even though i didn't care for the product it did smell nice . update : i have been taking a very small amount , a petite pea size , and rubbing it into my scalp then shampooing it out and it has left my hair quite silking and manageable . 
=================
holy crap well i used this for the first time last night after dinner around 7pm . as the directions stated , i didn't brew it for long . i added hot water to the cup with the teabag but the water wasn't hot enough so i microwaved it for 30 seconds let it sit another 30 seconds and removed the teabag . i added a sweet and low and it tasted good , not like medicine at all . i was fine , laying in bed watching tv for the next 2 - 3 hours , then the cramping started . i got progressively worsening cramps from the upper part of my abdomen all the way down to the bottom of my belly , it was very painful . i started feeling very bloated like i needed to belch or . . . well . . . yea . i noticed that the cramping was at its worst when i was laying down , standing up i felt better . i got nauseous and thought i would throw up . then i had to run to the bathroom because the extreme laxative effect was kickin in . this lasted until about 2 : 30am and i need to get up for work in the morning . i was really miserable . in the morning i felt ok until i ate breakfast ( a bowl of crispix cereal ) then i felt like i needed to use the bathroom again . doubt i will use this again but if i do i will only drink a quarter of a cup . 
=================
tastes great , yet will never buy again ! this sweetener although highly expensive $ 9 . 99 for a tiny bottle tasted like the real thing . i used it on my low carb pancakes . within the hours i had horrible stomach cramps and was very gassy . i thought it might be the pancakes but i used the syrup to sweeten something else . again with the gas pains , i read reviews online that others suffered from the same problem due to the sugar substitute that is utilized . the bottle is around 80 % full and will never use it again . 
=================
good but not great ok but not the rich tomato flavor i expect from italian variety . a reader commented on my review and pointed out that carmelina does not add much by way of chemicals to enhance the flavor . he / she nailed me , i guess . and a little bit of salt brings these 'maters up to snuff . my own chemicals being better for me than theirs .

paragon sugar free wild cherry i really didnt like the taste . i need something sugar free that doesnt have an after taste of artificial sweetner and with this product i was disappointed
=================
wretched i love good black licorice . i love salted dark chocolate caramels . i thought salted black licorice , what a great idea . it might be the rankest candy i have ever tasted . it must be what putting formaldahyde in your mouth would taste like . then i had to throw it away as you cannot return food items via amazon . you should have smaller sample packs for first time users ! 
=================
love love love these ! ( edited because no longer available in prime ) perfect . . . just a little something sweet to keep you going . . . no aftertaste of any kind . ( because of the reviews , just ordered the berry and orange . . . can't wait to try those , too . ) great tasting sugar free candy is not always easy to find . . . this one hits a home run . and as a bonus , the box is adorable . . easy to pop in your purse . : ) * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * no longer available in prime so that takes care of that item . nice going amazon or whomever is responsible . let me know when the shipping is not off the charts .

still have moles . . . . i tried several tricks to rid myself of my moles . i tried flooding them and using flares in their hole . . all with no success . i bought this trap last spring . it's now fall and i still have moles . as a matter of fact , it hasn't caught one mole yet ! ! i just got a couple kittens that i'm hoping will help me with the mole problem in the spring . i think my next trick will be to try those poisen worms or some people have suggested using wrigley chewing gum . . . . if none of those things work i may have to resort to dynamite ! ! if i do try another trap , it'll be one of those in - line traps . . . .

waxy , too thick , gas - causing it's challenging to create a chocolate bar with erythritol or xylitol without compromising texture and flavor ( " cooling " effect ) . but it is doable ! i've ordered chocolates sweetened with xylitol or erythritol from 3 other manufacturers , and i was pleasantly surprised that they weren't waxy . this one , unfortunately , is so waxy that it doesn't taste like chocolate at all . some people liken these bars to easter bunnies , but don't the bunnies have a better mouthfeel ? perhaps it's due to the fact that the bunnies are thin ( hollow ) , and therefore kind of elegant . this bar is a very thick solid block - difficult to bite . what made it even worse in my case - i happened to try the almond variety , and they contained intact almonds ! other manufacturers break almonds into small pieces , and that's what creates an elegant experience . eating this one felt like alternating between putting a plain almond and a piece of sweetened wax in the mouth . finally , they contain oligofructose ( fos ) , which causes gas in sensitive people . some may get bloated from eating just 1 / 3 of this bar . the alternatives that i mentioned above are : - the best one by far was a custom order from a small maker . e - mail cocosrawchocolates at yahoo , and she will make it the way you want . fantastic ! ! ! - lucienne's - i haven't tried their improved version yet . the previous version , while flavorful and with decent texture , was too acidic to my taste ( i usually eat 90 % - cocoa bars , but only non - acidic ) ; - healthy chocolate ( their product is sold under several labels , e . g . " xyla " ) - although it wasn't waxy , it still lacked the right texture and flavor , was very boring ( opinion shared by relatives and friends ) ;

v8 cherry pomegranate beverage the v8 brand caught my eye and raised my expectations ; they have a reputation for quality products . so even without detailed pictures of both the front and back labels or the having ingredients listed on this product's description , i purchased this item . when it arrived i was very disappointed because this product contains only 10 % juice ! this " flavored beverage " is a juice drink in my estimation and an expensive one at that . the first two ingredients are : water , high fructose corn syrup . . . i'm so confused about what actually is considered : juice , juice cocktail , juice drink , flavored water and / or how much juice is really in each of them . the consumer is at the short end of this confusion and this deal in particular .

cookies , not jerky - - and the dogs are not pleased i was searching for usa - made chicken jerky for my two chows and the plato line came up . my goof not to realize these 'strips' are baked cookies , not dried chicken meat strips , and the dogs have made it very clear - - they definitely prefer real jerky . they don't seem to like the ( sort of dry - fudgy ) texture of these treats , but will 'accept' the chicken and the salmon , while simply rejecting the duck version . broken up as training bits for the puppy these will probably be usable , which is good since they aren't cheap . later i found bellyrubs brand chicken jerky ( at about half the price of plato ) at a feed store , and i am back in the dogs' good graces . 
=================
toblerone weight details there are no details about the weight of the toblerone products offered on line . . . . . . . . 24 count means nothing what is the net weight per bar . it is suggested that both the single bar weight and total weight per box of 24 should be specified to make clear what one is buying also for the 60 count mini toblerone , it does not show the total weight of the 60 count mini toblerone box . please clarify & display these details on your web site to facilitate a buying decision . thanks
=================
jj quality of this product is good , my only issue is with the size . i purchased another one of the same brand at a cake decorating store . it was 4x the size or this product and it was less expensive than this one . won't be purchasing this from amazon again . 
=================
another great concept with not - as - great execution . black cherry switch is 100 % juice ( a mixture of juices actually , but more on that later ) combined with filtered sparkling water . it has no sugar added or corn syrup , no artificial colors or preservatives - - these are all positive attributes . i think the concept of combining fruit juice and carbonation in a small - shot serving ( 8 . 3 ounces in a slim can ) is just fine . my problem with black cherry switch in particular ( the only flavor i have tried ) is that cherry juice is listed fourth out of four juices this beverage contains ( the other three are apple , grape and acerola juices ) . as a result , the cherry flavor ends up battling ( and getting trounced by ) these other flavors . the end result was , for me , inadequate cherry flavor . will i run out to buy more black cherry switch ? no . even though the beverage was refreshing , the cherry flavor was too muddled by other juices and too low in the ingredients list to give me the punch of black cherry flavor that i expected and wanted . would i buy more black cherry switch if it had a more distinct cherry taste ? yes , it is highly likely that i would buy it at least occasionally . 
=================
good price , decent coffee but not much hazalnut flavor this coffee smells terrific as it brews . the flavor is nice but is missing any distinctive hazalnut flavor . if it's the taste your after , order something different . if it's the scent you like but are not a big hazelnut fan , this might be your brew . 
=================
great product but beware of poor packaging . the product is amazing . it's the consistency of creamy peanut butter , but it tastes like cookies . other reviewers rave about it , and i agree with them . it basically tastes heavenly on anything or even by itself . the bad - the seller packaged both jars together with no protection between them , which caused one of the jars to break . fortunately , the other jar is fine , but essentially , i got one jar for the price of two . i could get a refund if i return everything , but i don't want to return the undamaged jar , because the product is so good . 
=================
no waste with this lime ! we tried in a hotel a few months back and have purchased a box after that . i like the fact you always have " lime " and there is no waste . great for flavored water or your favorite cocktail . 
=================
ginger beer ? not i like ginger beer - but was disappointed in this ginger ale . it is not ginger beer and is especially not fiery . then most absurd of all it has aspartame - and is not listed as a diet drink . false information on this product . i did contact seller - with no response
=================
dog loves it but nutrition value is a bust my dog loves it , it may be the soft texture but after giving it to her this week , she has had stomach issues so i checked the label , too much junk , no substance ; i should have done that first , i switched her to orijen which is a dry , good content , and she loves it ; voted best dog food in 2010 and 2011 . 
=================
i agree , stinky and skinny ! ! ! my mini schnauzer loves the ( expensive ) bully sticks we buy at the store , so i decided to try these . they are skinnier and she goes through them much faster . they also stink and make her breath stink ! ! we still have a lot left , not sure what i am going to do . 
=================
uncleat quantity we have used the product for years but can no longer get it locally . the problem was with the description which says it comes as 8 count , 1 . 13 oz box . apparently what this means is a box ontains 8 packets which is true . however , the way it is worded i expected to receive 24 boxes as i had ordered quantity of three . 3x8 = 24 . i received only three boxes at a cost of $ 26 . 97 which means ipaid $ 8 . 99 for one box of 8 packets . one box of 8 packets can be purchased anywhere including amazon for between $ 2 . 00 and $ 3 . 00 . this order is being returned for refund . if the price is actually $ 8 . 99 for one box , the description should read " price $ 8 . 99 , quantity , one box of 8 packets . of course if it actually said that , they would never sell any at all . it is my opinion that the correct price is 8 boxes of 8 packets each for $ 8 . 99 . that makes a lot more sense but that is just my opinion . 
=================
not what i expected . we bought this with the hope of preventing cats from getting out . they are smart enough to bait the dog to come near the door and let them out or in as they wish . i think this door is overpriced . it does not come with a battery or charger , and you really need 2 batteries so you can charge one while using the other . we installed it into a door , so using the ac power cord is not a good option . also , our puppy chewed through the wire connecting our computer to the internet the first week we got him , making us nervous about a power cord in his space . we got a 2nd puppy . a few days later we found the cover of his collar transmitter in the yard . i guess the two dogs played too roughly and the transmitter came apart ? the button battery from the inside was missing , and it was 5 : 30 pm . we looked in the grass for it til it got dark but never found it . swallowing a button battery is a medical emergency , kind of like appendicitis , only it can affect any part of the gi tract . so we had to take both dogs to the emergency vet to get x - rayed to see if either had eaten the battery . no battery in either dog , thank goodness , but we spent a bit more than $ 250 for that information . the collar transmitter should have a screw or something to hold it together better . i am currently writing this from my bedroom , and i hear the door opening and closing over and over . a dog must be sitting too close . guess that means we will be charging the battery again in the am . i'm annoyed by the sound , though it is not horribly loud . i really wish we had gone with a heavy duty magnetic type door .

organic does not equal healthy we received two of the earth's best bars in a holiday gift bag for our toddler . in an 18 gram bar , there were about 6 grams of sugar - - a full third of the bar is sugar . no wonder there are rave reviews about how much the toddlers are enjoying them !

white chocolate mousse calorie control the testure is very light and that is good . the taste is very strong of artificial sweetner . this might be ok served over a dish of fresh berries . but alone the taste is lacking . i will not buy this flavor again . however , many of the other ediet desserts are most excellent . i highly recommend the other mousse desserts & flavors . 
=================
eehh i havent had these since i was a teen ( about 7 years ago ) , saw them and what i thought i remembered was they were good and i liked them . . . what was i thinking ? these krispy bars are waayyyy too sweet - i probably still have over half a box left and i bought these weeks ago ( in a household of 4 where 3 of us would eat this ) . next time i'll buy the ingredients and make them homemade instead ! 
=================
good stuff but way too expensive ! the product itself deserves 5 stars as all 3 of my cats go crazy and sometimes even fight for it . however , kitty kaviar or " bonito flakes " as the japanese call them are used in actual cooking and if you look it up under this name on amazon , there are sellers who are selling it for a fraction of the price listed here . you can also find this at your local korean / japanese grocer in big bags that last months . 
=================
loses effectiveness fast really good when i first opened the pack ; however , it seems to lose its effectiveness rather fast , refrigerated or frozen . i will not buy this brand again . 
=================
don't like i have used quality salts for years , and have always especially loved the pink salt variety , so i ordered this one because it is much cheaper than others out there . well , this one just doesn't taste like the pink salts i've had in the past . upon tasting , i also i realized that this salt is just 'too pink' for me to believe that it is not enhanced in some way ! i've never seen this salt look that way before . . . but hey , it is entirely possible that it is truly that color without additives . . . so i went to the source and wrote the company to find out . that was weeks ago , and they never bothered to respond . so i am assuming they can't back up their claim that it's truly a himalayan pink sea salt . what's funny is , on every container of salt i've ever purchased there is an ingredients list . . . not on this one . ( if it's pure , then the ingredients will obviously have only one ingredient . . . the salt . but sometimes , even in sea salt , there is an added anti - caking agent added so it will be listed there . ) anyway , amazon is wonderful and refunded me for this salt , so i will purchase a different brand . 
=================
shipping is what brought this down to 2 stars i was charged just as much for shipping as what the product cost ! over $ 12 for this small box of coconut creme powder ! i love the product , it tastes rich and wonderful , but i'll find it elsewhere for less than that . . . 
=================
don't get if you have a sensitive nose ! i love licorice , and figured these would be good . they are - - the texture is right , the saltiness and sweetness were right on . however , when you eat these , you get a very strong ammonia smell in your nose , due to the ammonium chloride . i wish they would salt them with something else , because this smell is a bit overwhelming , and makes the product a little unpleasant . it makes me wonder , too , how healthy it is to be consuming something that has an obvious amount of ammonia in it . . . if ammonia doesn't bother you , then i would recommend these on initial flavor and texture . 
=================
hard to get into toy ! these are so hard to get into the toy ! i have had to resort to using a screwdriver to actually get it in . the medium size is also difficult , but nowhere near as hard as the large size . i was really excited about these when i bought the toy , but it is so hard to get in that now i only use it when i know i will be gone for a significant amount of time . the first time i gave it to my dog , he had it out in about 2 minutes . thankfully the next time it took a couple of days , but it is annoying to get these in . 
=================
not very good i'm a vegetarian , i enjoy sprouted grain breads and meat alternatives , but as far as desserts go , i still find very few vegan / gluten free ones i like the taste of . this one was not very good . i still prefer to bake with butter , eggs and ( wheat ) flour . 
=================
wow never thought i would get so excited over a boxed cake mix . but after spending way too much money on gluten - free products that taste awful with a sawdust texture . this tastes like the real deal . i did listen to previous reviews and add a box of instant vanilla pudding . no one in my family could tell that they were gf . even my finicky non celiac teenagers could tell the difference and they ate the whole cake ! thanks to betty crocker for making affordable gf products ! ! 
=================
typical american junk food first of all i thought these were going to be oreo sandwich cremes with peanut butter filling , covered in a fudge coating . well , the inside is not a 'sandwich' creme - it's one oreo disc with some kind of processed ( to the point of no - peanut - flavor ) cream inside , and the whole thing is then coated in fudge ( which oreo loosely uses to mean 'chocolate , ' but i knew it wasn't really going to be real fudge ) . because there's only one cookie inside each unit , the proportions are pretty gross - you get the medium firm texture of the outer chocolate layer , which is fine , but a single interior cookie is not enough crunch to set off the sort of lardy faux - peanut - butter layer . my son ( age 10 ) ate a bunch and probably would have eaten more , but i'm more of a discerning customer when it comes to both chocolate and peanut butter , so i stopped after my 2 experimental ones . i do like plain oreos , and the plain oreos covered in the 'fudge' - but this combo just doesn't do it for me . it seems like it's just a typical processed sweet snack food with no real flavor . 
=================
above and beyond any reasonable expectation . i live in an urban coach house where the rear faces the alley . the alley is filled with trash , so as one might expect , i get my fair share of rogue flies in my house . i first tried the sticky fly tape stuff inside , and while it worked decently , it was more of a situation where it would catch a fly if it just happened to land on the strip . i still found myself killing more of them via shoe than the tape managed to catch . not to mention having fly tape in your house is disgusting and messy . so i decided to try the victor fly magnet outside by the garbage . if this thing caught 30 flies i would be satisfied . it caught , seriously , thousands . they are literally jam packed in it all the way to the top , and more are still trying to muscle their way in . i'm not only amazed by how well this trap works , i'm amazed that this many flies live near my home . my only question is , what do i do with it now ? set it on fire ? tape a grenade to it ? in the 4 days since i put it outside , i have not had one fly in my house . not a single one . oh , and it doesn't stink that bad . the bait , when your mixing it in , smells like a barn or perhaps a dead fish . i can barely smell it when i'm standing next to the trap full of flies in the hot summer air . 
=================
good kick , but funky flavor these have a good kick , come in nice packaging , and have an initially good flavor , but they have a sour aftertaste that leaves a nasty flavor in your mouth that lingers . not exactly what i think of when i think of cherry jelly bellies . however , they do give you a quick shot of energy . 
=================
6 month old puppy did not really go for this i have a 6 month old pomeranian puppy who loves chewing . i introduced this product to him , along with a compressed rawhide stick , and a himalayan dog chew ( himalayan dogs chew 3 to 5 - pieces for dogs up to 20 - pound , 3 - 1 / 2 - ounce ) at the same time . he jumped on the compressed rawhide and did not stop until he'd eaten it all about a week later . he looooooved this thing - it must have tasted super good ! he then tried the antler for maybe a day . . . it had an interesting smell coming from the part that was cut , and so he chewed on this for a little bit and got some of the hard interior out , but that was it . he's loving the himalayan dog chew though and now carries it everywhere . . . it's very hard but can be bitten through and eaten if he works at it long enough , and he seems to like the flavor of it . he's totally forgotten about the antler . it's just sitting on the floor now . it's just too hard for him . i tried at least - i want him to have more natural treats and chew toys ! like another reviewer said earlier , it definitely depends on your dog and you won't know until you've bought the product and tried it out . 
=================
good taste but too high in sodium i ate this brand for years until i was put on a sodium restricted diet . there's no reason that i can see to add salt to oatmeal . until nature's path at least lowers the sodium i'll be buying instant oatmeal with no salt added - yes it's available . 
=================
tastes like cardboard and if i wanted that i'd chew on the box i'm always game for trying new food . i love graham crackers and always have since i was a kid ( yeah , i know , i should go for the more fancy food by now ) . back to nature's golden honey oat grahams seem like a cool idea in principle - - it doesn't have any added sugar , is made with oats and generally seems like it would be healthy for you with the possibility that it might taste good . it doesn't . eating these made me think of what it must be like to be a termite and chew on the beams of a crunchy new house . sadly , back to nature is a bad thing in this case . if nature intended us to eat this type of stuff there would be trees that had cardboard squares hanging down from them . i realize that the makers of this product have good intentions . the road to hell is paved with " food " like this . i'd try the other road where the food that might be less healthy tastes a whole lot better . i'll be putting this in the recycling bin with the cardboard boxes that amazon ships their products to me in where it belongs . you might want to chew on this for a while before ordering this stuff and keep in mind it's just food for thought . i will say one thing - - it's rare that what's in the package tastes just like the package . avoid . 
=================
carmel macchiato the carmel macchiato is a bit to sweet for me . if you like sweet , that's the one for you to buy . i keep it on hand for my friends when they visit
=================
better as a dipping sauce , still not that good this sauce has a very spicy kick to it in heat and a little more tanginess than i prefer . it isn't bad but am not sure it works that great with tacos . i think it better as a dipping sauce for fried foods or veggies . even that is a bit of a stretch . i wouldn't be a buyer .

del destino caper berries recently i traveled to italy where caper berries were served as a one of the small snacks accompanying cocktails or wine in the late afternoon . i found the caper berries in italy to be superior and far less salty than the del destino caper berries i obtained through yahoo .

great product - - outrageous price ! this premium tonic is definitely worth getting , but not at this price . fentimans and q - tonic also good , but fever tree is my favorite . . . . more bubbly and citrusy . wegmans sells it for $ 6 / four pack . 
=================
too sweet i have tried several varieties of the k - cups now , coffees , teas , and hot chocolate and i have enjoyed several , but these i found to be much too sweet . i love the caribou blend k - cup single - serving coffee 108 ct . and green mountain - keurig - nantucket blend - k - cup - box of 24 kcups for the coffees . for the teas i enjoy twinings keurig k - cups african rooiobos tea for keurig brewers , 25 - count k - cups ( pack of 2 ) and celestial seasonings k - cups india spice chai , 8 . 8 - ounce boxes ( pack of 2 ) as well as the any of the english breakfast teas .

sweetness ! this stuff does taste kinda like starbucks . but with all the sugar i did'nt really enjoy it . buy this if your running low on sugar and don't like green tea .

barry farms they may have great products , but shipping is incredibly slow ( shipped 12 days after i placed the order ; not yet received ) and the shipping price is unreasonable .

expiration date ? actually i'd like to buy this dry milk powder . but i saw one past review saying that the expiration date of this product is sep . 2012 which means it only has 5 months left . i left this review , because i'd like to ask the owner when is the expiration date for the product we will receive if we order now . thanks . 
=================
decent islay blend a somewhat decent blended of peaty islay malts . the rumor is that it used to contain mostly lagavulin , but i don't know if there is any truth to that . the fact is , the bottler probably buys casks of whatever islay distiller has over - produced . the result is that the flavors change from bottle to bottle . not bad , just different . a cheaper way to sample the flavors of islay . 
=================
very , very sweet i tried this creamer because i like caramel flavored coffee and i like creamer . whether you will like it or not is a matter of personal preferences . i couldn't detect any caramel taste to it . one sip was enough for me due the overwhelming sweetness . it tasted like someone had dropped a few dozen tablespoons of sugar in my coffee . if you like extremely sweet coffee and don't care about caramel flavor , you might like this product . if you mainly want caramel flavor , you would be better off with a caramel syrup or flavored coffee beans . 
=================
pricey ! ! ! ! when i saw that amazon had the country time raspberry lemonade i was so excited since it is becoming increasingly difficult to find it in stores ; however , the cost quickly squelched my enthusiasm ! ! i will not be purchasing this product from amazon .

magical ? senna tea is truly magical in the way it temporarily replaces your internal organs with bees . i guess i must not be worthy enough in the constipation department to truly reap the benefits of senna , and so the gods of this truly magical herb treated me instead to merciless abdominal pain and rear - ended agony . does it make you poop ? yes , you will poop everything that is inside you , including your innards . 
=================
a little too smokey for my taste ! we used this sauce on tacos and as a dipping sauce . though i am a big fan of mexican food , i found the smokiness of the sauce to be overwhelming to the rest of the food . i could not taste the rest of the food . i would imagine , however , that if diluted in sour cream , the smokiness would serve as a compliment to chicken . i have to admit that i experiment a lot with dressings , sauces , spices , etc of different brands , and it's possible that the strength of " chipotle " flavored ingredients is simply not appealing to me . if you do try this , i'd use only a bit , to test the waters - the flavor and smell went right up my nose . 
=================
price is $ 7 . 95 the price for just one package ? seriously ? can someone tell me if you receive more than one package ? the price i paid for one when living in hawaii ( only 4 months ago ) was only $ 1 . 69 . how can it cost 4 times more here ? i love this dressing and was my favorite so hope i am wrong about what i see for the price of one package ! original hawaiian papaya seed dressing mix

not as good as pepsi throwback . i like the fact that this comes in glass bottles , which makes it taste better . but it is not as good as pepsi throwback .

try gloria jean's peppermint herbal tea instead in the larger world , my favorite mint tea is bigelow's plantation mint . unfortunately , that's not available in the keurig world . in trying to replicate plantation mint , i bought four sample packs of mint options directly from keurig for testing . gloria jean's version is the best of the mints by far . my problem with timothy's ? it has a strong twang up front and a noticeable unpleasant chemical aftertaste that tastes a bit like chewing a mint leaf whole . even when cut with a lot of water as iced tea is , it still has a too - sharp quality . i hesitate to add this lest i make myself sound crazy , but it also feels like it's forming a film on my tongue and throat as i swallow . i've tried about a dozen keurig flavors as iced tea and none of the others make this " film . " so try it if you must , but take it from someone who's actually compared . . . there are better options for mint tea in the keurig world . to make iced tea easily in a keurig , you need a very strong glass that won't break when taken from boiling to freezing . ( crate & barrel's excellent large working glass is the strongest i've found that still looks good . ) in a 21 - ounce glass , put your sweetener in - - 1 . 75 teaspoons of splenda for me , 1 . 25 t for my husband - - then brew a medium cup of tea . add ice to almost fill the glass . the ice will melt easily and will end up to be 1 / 4 of the total volume . stir and drink . the quality of your ice matters since the melted part will become at least half the drink . if you'd like to try a flavored iced tea other than mint , my very favorite is gj's passion fruit . it's out of stock , so i can't link to it . until it's available here , try the close second - place tea : gloria jean's coffees , tea k - cup , mango - flavored black tea for keurig brewers , 24 - count boxes ( pack of 2 ) .

it's hard to do better than wellness wellness is among the best cat foods out there . it is grain - free and it has ingredients of high quality . there are no meat by - products . my only caveat is that wellness' products with fish are not so good . quite frankly , cats don't eat fish in the wild , so their digestive systems are not designed for consumption of fish . that being said , this is a fantastic specific product . the meat is fresh , and i know my cat loves it . i adopted my cat ( he is five ) , and within weeks his coat was softer , the colors more vivid and i began seeing markings and colors i never saw before . on another note , i can't help but take a dig at one of the worst , if not the worst , foods out there . . . science diet . take a read on the ingredients . in doing so , you will the natural , very high grade , pure ingredients of wellness contrasted with the low grade , artificial , even mysterious ingredients of science diet food . hill's chooses the name " science diet " to lend it credibility that it just doesn't have . finally , cats can't digest grains and soy . hill's food is riddled with that stuff . bottom line : stay with wellness ; stay away from science diet .

great service and prices , crapy product i think a better description of all non - traditional , gummy products as these are needed to eliminate confusion . these gummys , as the other single fruit line are covered in crystalised sugar , and are more of a sweet candy . traditional gummbybears are asoft in and out single source cansy , the one we had as kids , these are quite sweet and hard to enjoy .

negative purchased the raspberry fruit rolls 3 times . the last 2 times ( 5 months apart ) the raspberry rolls were hard as rocks and had a perfume taste to them . all the other flavors were great .

afraid not i really wanted to disagree with customer wallace about this , and decided to take the plunge anyway since it was only a wee over two dollars . the ingredients in the description are the same as on the package : ingredients : black tea , orange peel and flavor . it doesn't say natural flavor , so i assume not , but don't know . smelling the tea inside the packet gives a very pleasant odor of black tea with a touch of grapefruit . unfortunately , using a decent amount of the dried tea , the taste of the tea was like very weak black tea , very watery , and you really had to spend time trying to sense any grapefruit despite the actual grapefruit peel in it . wait - it says orange peel , not pink grapefruit . sheesh . i just noticed that . but it doen't give you a sense of orange either . i was browsing amazon's tea because i had run out of a box of really great grapefruit tea ( bags ) made in poland and bought at my local dollar store , but the store no longer carries it . the brand name is babcia jagoda , with a smiling granny giving the ok sign . she's right . it has hibiscus , apple , rosehip , black currant , black chokeberry in it , but also lists " grapefruit aroma " and grapefruit juice , i assume dried . there is no black tea in it so i assume it's all herbal , but the thing is : it does have grapefruit aroma , but most importantly , it tastes grapefruity . i'm going to have to search online for a new source .

very disappointing i really wanted to love this litter , but it just didn't impress me . i have 4 cats and 4 litter boxes that i scoop at least once a day so i am ( sadly ) a litter expert . i agree that there's significantly less dust and the little dust there is doesn't seem as irritating as the dust from the tidy cat scoopable litter i use . that's not a big deal for me though as i just pour the tidy cat slowly and turn my head away so the dust doesn't bother me . on the plus side , this litter weighs significantly less than traditional litter , which is nice when you have to lug it around . my cats were very willing to use it , but they are pretty easy going and have never " boycotted " the litter box for any reason as some cats do when you make a change . now , for what i didn't like . . . i was really hoping for something that didn't get tracked all over the house , but i actually found that this was tracked further and quicker than my other litter . i'm sure of this because i only used this new litter in one box on the far side of the house so it was easy to see where and how fast it was scattered throughout the house . in terms of tracking litter , i actually found this to be more annoying than the tidy cat because these pellets are bigger . it was uncomfortable when i accidentally stepped on this litter in my bare feet ( which happened often since it was tracked so far ) and the bigger pieces show up more easily so it also looked really messy . to be fair , 2 of my 4 cats have long hair so litter gets trapped in the fur on their feet and i guess it was just worse with this stuff . this litter did provide good odor control , but i found it to be no better than my tidy cat scoop litter . though the odor control was decent , the litter doesn't change color or otherwise indicate when it's been saturated by liquid waste and the " clumps " fell apart easily so i had to either scoop too much to be sure i got it all or risk leaving dirty litter in the box . that drove me crazy since this litter is pretty expensive if you have to throw away more than necessary just to be sure the box was clean . because of this issue , i went through the bag more quickly than they estimate in the instructions . i suppose if the dust and the weight of traditional litter are big problems for you or if you really want to be able to flush your litter , this may be your solution . if you are looking for an alternative that is significantly better in terms of tracking , odor and cost , i don't recommend this at all . also , the shipping costs were much too high ( i searched everywhere online to be sure there wasn't a better deal ) so be sure you factor that into the cost .

picky mastiff / shep / lab mutt my 1 yr old mastiff / germ shep / lab mix capone is picky ! basically when we got him he had been fed people food , not dog food . i spent well over a couple hundred dollars trying different dog foods , and out of all the dry kibbles , this is the only thing he will eat . not to mention , its cheaper than most of the other ones . i did ask my vet , and he said this was a great thing for him to gain weight . this dog is supposed to be a good 80 - 90 pounds , and hes only 75 pounds . when we got him he was 72 , but hes gained a few since then , and that was back in late may / early june . this is probably the best food for a dog that likes gravy more than the actual food itself . capone loves what i've always called his 'mush' , and we used to do this for my last dog dexter ( cocker / lab ) and he would eat just bout anything . its great for a cold day , cause to them its basically like hot soup or a hot drink for us . every morning he smacks the heck outa his bowl wanting me to make 'mush' . sometimes when i dont make 'mush' he wants moist and meaty as a topper , but for a picky dog , go find some of this , dollar general has it where i live , they may in other places . try this and moist and meaty if you have a half starved dog like i do . i've tried everything , beniful , purina , all that . the only stuff i wont give him is pedigree , mostly b / c my cat tries to eat it and it gives her very bad 'bombs' if you catch my meaning . he turned his nose at it . i swear if it wasnt for this dog food , my dog wouldn't be alive .

pricey this coffee is great but the deal is not . you can get these direct from keurig for about . 54 cents per cup . this " deal " equates to . 64 cent per cup . good coffee , bad deal . if your buying 160 of these at one time , the price should reflect it !

not what i was expecting , but . . . i thought this would have more of an oatmeal consistency , but instead the grains remain somewhat separate and not particularly creamy . however , with dried fruit and a bit of agave , it makes a nice change from oatmeal . you just have to get past the consistency being different .

product 5 stars - shipper , zero i love this product and have been using it for years . however , the estimated delivery date was march 23rd . this is april 5th and i still don't have it . my first email to the shipper has been ignored . tracking shows the item as shipped by usps but tracking is not available . i sent another email to shipper today . i'll keep you posted on the results . unless this is an isolated incident these people are bad news . my account has been charged .

excellent , but price is way off ! this is an excellent product , but for the same quantity it is $ 5 . 34 at costco . i use this for cleaning and getting rid of stubborn odors everywhere , and it just works . i seriously don't know why it is so overpriced from this merchant though .

knorr needs new recipes . . . . when my son had knorr pasta sides beef 2 weeks ago , he puked it up 2 hours after he ate the stuff . he told me it was good stuff , so i thought i would pick up knorr pasta sides chicken , and guess what , he puked that up too ! but , it was good stuff , according to him . he can tolerate the rice , but he pukes up the pasta sides . perhaps knorr might recall all the pasta sides as they may have a puking agent in them ?

no coffee flavor / high calorie count i really wanted a decaf product so didn't have a lot of options . this powder essentially makes a chocolate flavored blended drink , even when i use cold decaf coffee or espresso as the " base " , the chocolate is what you taste . when i think of an iced coffee drink , i think of coffee with a hint of chocolate ( mocha ) not the other way around . as other reviewers point out , the 150 calories is for half the packet and no milk added . i will try a different brand next time . i'm still on the hunt for a mix that creates the same flavor i've experienced once in a great while at a coffee shop . or like the iced blended at a west coast chain ( cb & tl ) that is overpriced to have shipped ( and i think is available sugar free ) !

hardcore stuff i don't usually write reviews but i feel compelled to do so based on a misconception going around about this product . this is not another snake oil fix - it - all . it contains grounded corn with herbs , not processed sugar . yes it is full of carbohydrates and natural sugars , but it is not candy or a magical elixir . the tarahumara indians use it to fuel their ultra - runs , but that does not mean that you should gobble it up for a quick pick - me - up in the morning . you wouldn't eat running gels , protein shakes or michael phelps's lunch and then not do the work . if you want an alternative to gu or energy bars try this , if you are trying to get healthy by simply ingesting something ; don't .

earl grey tea pods for tassimo we received the pods within two weeks of ordering them , unlike the last time , when the order was cancelled by amazon after it wasn't filled in 60 days . places of business shouldn't advertise products for sale if they don't have it in stock .

too expensive i can purchase the natural cola through my food co - op , have it delivered to my door and pay $ 16 for a case of 24 12oz . cans . price is way too high to be bought through amazon . the cola is great tasting , all natural and made with real sugar . so good for the product , bad for this merchant .

good for a couple days my lab chewed up the rope in a couple hours . this alone is not a huge deal as the instructions with the toy say that a ball can be placed inside the container and have a similar effect as the rope . however , before i could even place a ball in it , the plastic developed a large crack from the dog just carrying his toy around the house and dropping it on our carpetted floors . he has other plasic toys that he has had for months with absolutely no signs of damage . 
=================
not worth the price i tried this once and expected something out of this world . it was good , don't get me wrong , but not for this outrageous price . there is a uniqueness in all coffees and this one has such a taste - subtly bitter , rich , a coffee that should be made by professionals , not the sipper with his $ 150 coffee pot . try the popoyan instead . 
=================
clumps : does not dissolve in liquids had high hopes for this product , but am very disappointed . the relative dietary pros and cons of the inulin fiber are a separate issue , but this product does not dissolve in liquids , as others have noted . but i need to add that it is not just in cold drinks , but any drink , including hot coffee and tea . i'll post pictures , but with coffee , you'll get huge solid clumps at the bottom of your cup , no matter how hot the water and no matter how aggressively you stir . with cold drinks , like ice tea and lemonade , i can see the clumps swishing around in my naglene bottle - - just like a snow globe as someone else wrote - - and all the vigorous shaking in the world does nothing to break them up . this causes you to use more of the product than you should and you're in for an awful , unpleasant surprise if you accidentally drink one of the clumps . this product may be ok to use on oatmeal or cereal , but not liquids . i am very happy with the sweetleaf tabs , however , which seem to dissolve well - - probably due to the lack of inulin fiber . 
=================
not what you might expect in terms of " quick cooking " at its weight , the huge bag of nishiki quick cooking brown rice ( 10 pounds ) isn't worth the hassle of returning . no way does this have a retail value of more than $ 60 , by the way , but i bought it for just over $ 20 , because i thought i could make brown and white seasoned rice blends whereby the rice would cook in the same amount of time . brown rice takes much longer to steam or cook up than long grain white rice , and my family isn't fond of the flavor of brown rice by itself . i can get regular brown rice for much less cost at the grocery store than this package from amazon , and when it arrived ( very quickly - 5 stars for delivery ) i read the package to discover the rice must be soaked for 20 minutes in water before cooking for an additional 25 minutes ! yikes ! nothing quick about a 45 minute process for rice . while i hadn't expected minute rice , i did expect a label stating " quick cooking " meant it actually cooks up quickly . for those who might not have cooked plain , brown rice , it steams or cooks up in the same 45 minutes or less that this " quick cooking " rice requires . i didn't even open the bag and will pass it on to someone who cooks brown rice on a regular basis . if you like brown rice and you don't have many local grocery stores , it might be worth buying from amazon , but don't expect this brand / type to save time in the kitchen .

the coming rabbit crisis i am shocked that amazon would conspire in rabbit slaughter and their consumption by the public . rabbits are cute and furry . they are the most popular pet in baluchistan and parts of vanuatu . many people have expressed their desire to marry rabbits , and the 9th circuit will soon affirm our constitutional right to realize that desire . many rabbits are wealthy and productive members of society . rabbits invented the steam engine , the toaster oven , the pneumatic bolt gun , and spandex . rabbits pay 27 % of all u . s . income taxes . this fall , for the first time , rabbits make up the majority of incoming freshman at miami university of ohio . since they received the right to vote in 1979 , rabbits have been reliable supporters of the whig party , which is the only thing standing between the world and utter chaos . last march , while the rest of us were cowering in basements and bomb shelters , rabbits were defending earth against the venusian invasion . of course the rabbits have begun to fight back against our heartless exploitation . roving bands of rogue rabbits have remained armed since their defeat of the venusians , and ` wilding' by rabbit gangs has made new york's central park unsafe at all hours of day and night . a radical whig splinter group , led by the mysterious rabbit who calls himself lucky lepus , has even been calling for armed revolt in pursuit of a separate , nuclear , rabbit republic . if we know what's good for us , we will put down the butcher's knife and make peaceful accommodation with the rabbits while it is still possible . amazon , for the love of god , stop selling this product before the rabbits come for us all .

screw the marketing . . . forget about the advertising and marketing , advertisements are all lies to make a quick buck anyway , in my my mind . i bought this out of pure curiosity because well . . . the advertisements worked and got me curious enough to try it . did it get me laid ? of course not , not even close . i do however really like the smell of it and that's enough for me ! if a girl doesn't like the way you smell , forget 'em , they weren't worth your time in the first place ! : - pthis a good scent for me and that's that ! : - d also check out axe " fever " , that's a good one too .

imagine apple butter jello i had low hopes , i have picked up walden farms from a local grocery store and for the most part be underwhelmed with their products because of the cellulose flavor . . . if you want a nice creamy apple butter that is almost like apple sauce , this is not it . you can tell in the jar that it is thick ; but the flavors are on point and no cellulose flavor . i started eating it with a spoon out of the jar . . . cause you know that is healthy . the one draw back is that it gives me gas , a common thing with sugar replacements . i will buy again for sure !

has a bit of a chemical taste . i enjoy the pulp in my aloe drinks , and , sadly , the j1 aloe drink doesn't contain much of it . furthermore , there is an oddly chemical taste to the drink , which may be a product of the honey . this drink is also nearly cloyingly sweet , and , though i do enjoy a sweet beverage , something this sweet is a bit off - putting . of course , drinks are a matter of personal preference , so , to each their own . : )

seemed like a good food but caused urinary crystals twice i fed this flavor to my cat for over two and a half years ( as a kitten he ate grain - free innova ) , almost exclusively wet food . if he got hungry later i'd give him a tiny sprinkle of wellness dry ( salmon ) , but twice a day he got this food . he developed urinary crystals twice even though the food says it's designed to prevent this problem . i was a big believer in healthy , grain - free , wet food , " natural " cat food diets . even when i was unemployed for a year , my cat continued to eat wellness while i ate instant noodles . it was fine , i thought i was feeding him the best and pre - emptively striking against any preventable health problems . well , he got urinary crystals on one occasion ; i brought him to the vet , $ 1 , 000 later and he seemed fine . the vet cautioned me against returning to the same diet but i somehow thought it would be okay and that the diet wasn't to blame . well , it was . a few months later he got the same problem . another $ 1 , 000 later and boarding for four days , my vet ( whom i've trusted with all my pets , dearly , for many years ) told me that ( 1 ) the " natural pet food craze " was overblown and ridiculous , that he's fed a leading brand of standard grocery store cat food and has had cats live beyond 19 years ; ( 2 ) the diet was the cause of my cat's troubles , and i had to change it . well , now he's on prescription food that's even more expensive than the fancy stuff but with seemingly far less high - quality ingredients . but he hasn't had the problem come back , and from what i can tell , he's got the same energy levels and healthy coat as before , just minus the urinary troubles . the stray cats my family and i feed ( six others ) all get the junky grocery stuff like friskies , fancy feast , and purina , and they have never needed to go to the hospital . i know diet isn't the only factor but it is certainly the major one . i would rather have my cat eating food that doesn't send him to the hospital with a life - threatening condition , than one that makes me feel good about its " naturalness . " mind you , urinary crystals are severely painful and will kill your cat if not treated within hours . this food might work for many owners but i'm not taking the risk again .

quality inconsistent my last purchase of 4 cases of this food had a sour off - smell . called natural balance customer service , they said they hadn't received complaints about that batch , they'd pass info along to tech dept , they'd send me a coupon for 1 case . . . . but , it's a natural product , and variation " was to be expected " . they suggested i return it to the retailer . paying for shipping 3 times ( receiving , sending back , receiving again ) for a heavy product like this makes it very expensive . i've fed this variety to my 3 cats for a year ( alternate with natural balance ultra ) , and they have always loved it . they will only eat this batch if they are very very hungry . i can barely stand to open the cans . all other batches had a clean fresh smell . i'm disapointed with the customer service response to a quality issue from a heavy user of their premium priced product . ( i have 3 cats ) . i won't buy from natural balance again . i'll use the coupon locally , and make sure i'm mixing production runs .

beefaroni mostly macaroni i'm recently widowed so have to learn to fix for a single person . i hoped this microwaveable bowl of " beefaroni " would provide a tasty lunch . to my surprise , i found that it was nearly all macaroni , with some tomato sauce and a very small amount of beef . the taste was ok if you like macaroni and a rather strong tomato sauce , but i expected more beef . also , as with so many canned food these days , be prepared for a high dose of sodium - - salt , that is - - 31 % of average daily requirement in one small serving . overall , no so good .

damaged goods i received these the other day and 2 cans were severely damaged , i had to throw them out , and 5 other cans came with minor dents . they were packed together so it didn't look like the damage took place during shipping . edited note : today is may 30 , 2009 and i just wanted to post that amazon wrote to me and told me this problem has been rectified . i'm happy about that because i need to get these for my dog and at times they are hard to find . plus it's a great product .

bonsai tree seems almost dead when i got the tree in the mail half the leaves were already brown and crispy . i hoped that with water and sunlight i could nurse it back to health but it has now been almost a week and the leaves are almost all dead . i keep it watered and in sunlight but it seems to only be dying completely rather than coming back to full - health . i want to contact the seller but i can't find any information of how to do so . does anyone have any tips for my bonsai or of how to get a hold of the seller ? this would be greatly appreciated . i love the shape of the bonsai and it is so fun to have i just wish it would stay healthy ! let me know if anyone has any suggestions or information for me , thanks !

most won't eat them i take in stray cats . i currently have 14 . when one comes down with something possibly contagious , all go on antibiotics . the other week i picked up some antibiotics at the vet and then went and got these at the pet store ( $ 8 ! ! ! ) . i was so happy that pilling this many cats was finally going to be so simple and easy for a change . imagine my shock and annoyance when 10 of the 14 refused to eat them . the four that like them , love them , but the rest smell them and walk away .

flavored coffee this is a great product if you like flavored coffee , which i do . however , the price has now increased beyond what i would pay for it in local retail outlets . the convenience of having it delivered no longer outweighs the price . it is almost a $ 1 . 00 more per pound through amazon .

good every once in a while , but not often the switch kiwi berry carbonated fruit juice tasted good , but it was too sweet and had too many calories for my liking . i could drink a regular can of soda . going forward , i probably would not buy this beverage because i do not like to drink that many calories ( 135 ) or sugar ( 33 grams ) in one sitting .

my favorite gopicnic choice first , as a celiac ( needing to be gluten - free ) , i've been a fan of gopicnic for a while . they're great for travel , providing a nice fill - in for the airline meals we no longer receive . really , they kind of remind me of the sorts of lunch packs a lot of kids get - - single meal , shelf - stable , with various bits and pieces ready to combine once you dig in . the problem i've had with gopicnic is that i'm picky , and i've found that while i enjoy * something * out of each package , most have at least one , often several , items i don't care for . this is the first gopicnic package i've found where i like * everything * included . the asiago cheese , while not something i'd immediately think of for pizza , works great . the turkey pepperoni is tasty ( although greasy , as any real pepperoni is going to be if stored at room temperature . ) i * love * the dried fruit in this ( pineapple and , uh , cranberries , i think ? i'd have to look up the second one - - but whatever it is , i like it . ) and while the dried fruit could probably double as a desert , the almond roca is awesome - - unless you're one of those weird folks who hates almond roca . and if so , then , well , why ? how can you not feel a shudder of joy every time you bite into a piece of that chocolatey , crunchy , toffee - esque goodness ? well , it doesn't matter - - your odd aversion toward almond roca is none of my danged business , really . any time i travel , i bring gopicnic with me . and unless i'm just feeling daring and want to pick up a box of some flavor i've never tried , this will be the only one i'll bring . to the gopicnic folks , a suggestion , if you don't mind : any chance of tossing in a wet - wipe or towel with this one ? the grease thing really calls out for it . and , thanks for making something tasty , portable , * and * gluten - free . traveling with gluten sensitivity is a real pain in the butt . figuratively , and otherwise .

great coffee doesn't come from the mega brands unfortunately if you are seeking for really great coffee you're not going to reach the pinnacle with any of the global mega brands . you need to think of coffee as a fruit , which it is , and therefore it needs to be fresh . local for a roaster that stamps the 'roast date' on the bag for a start ( not the 'best before' date which is often a year after the roast date ) . londinium espresso roast in london to your specifications , and ship worldwide at cost .

good product , flimsy packaging we use air popped popcorn to replace microwave popcorn after finding out that microwave popcorn is loaded with nasty chemicals . we've orded this product before and it came in a plastic jar with a screw top . since this product was no longer available on amazon , we ordered the bags . shipping was very fast but one of the four bags was broken and my popcorn became the " popcorn " used for packaging material . i barely started to open another bag and the plastic came apart , spilling corn in my kitchen . just beware there is some risk in ordering the popcorn in the plastic bags . 
=================
large peas , meh flavor first impression was that these peas were larger than the great skott wasabi peas , 8 - ounce ( pack of 6 ) ones , however the taste isn't as good . wasabi flavor is a bit weak and the pea flavor lingers in your mouth . yeah , read that last sentence aloud to a friend . it's nice to have the big bag option , but would be nicer if they has a better flavor .

now pom & petals tea unlike the other reviewers for this product , i never tried the " pomegranate rose " version of this tea , and so i cannot compare it to the product they are now sending , which is called pom & petals . on the actual company website for zhena's gypsy tea they seem to make it sound like the two teas are identical and they have simply changed the name . anyways , the other reviewers are right - if you are ordering this and expecting to receive a tea called pomegranate rose , you won't . you're going to receive something called pom & petals . but i actually ordered this hoping for pom & petals , because i absolutely love it . i first tried the pom & petals tea in a sample stacker tin , and had to order the full size because i loved it so much . it has a subtle , gentle , floral taste to it , with a tiny hint of berry . when i take a sip it makes me think of shades of pink and victorian gardens . anyways , i'm not a sophisticated tea drinker but i really like it .

irish smoked salmon this was not our favorite smoked salmon through amazon . it's overly fishy tasting and the skin is on one side so it's not a net 3 pounds . the one we prefer through amazon is the 2 pound atlantic smoked salmon ( vendor is j . r mushroom ) and is fairly close to the scottish smoked salmon which is the gold standard . if you can splurge for the st . james reserve scottish smoked salmon ( can't remember the vendor ) , you'll be very pleased as we don't think it can be beat anywhere and is a very special indulgence over the holidays or any time you have a hankering for top notch smoked salmon . 
=================
best value , sorta but half expired i like the product and have been pleased with it from other vendors . i looked at all the vendors on amazon and found this one to be the best value on a delivered price per ounce value ( assuming you have amazon prime ) . however , the savings was very small compared to the next best value and this particular vendor shipped me containers that the date stamps showed they were already at least half expired . so if you are planning on storing this and not using it all within 6 months , i suggest you buy it elsewhere . if you plan to use it all within 6 months than it is the best value for your money ( maybe because it is discounted for being old stock ) . btw , amazon does not allow the return of these as the are classified as " grocery items " which are non - returnable .

dented cans ! ! ! if i was reviewing only the beans , i give them 5 stars ! the beans are excellent . however , ordering them from amazon is not . my beans arrived with at least one dent in every can . after all this time , amazon hasn't figured out how to ship these without them arriving damaged . 
=================
great product i like the clear scalp because it actually manages to give a bit of the old feel back , without making my hair feel greasy as if i've left conditioner in it . i've used this for about a week now , and really like how it makes my hair look and feel . definately worth a try if your trying to avoid that brillo pad head of grey hair like me . i used to have to worry about greasy , oily hair back in the day . i searched out shampoos that would dry out the scalp and leave my hair less oily . well a handful of years ago i started to go grey , and when i went grey , i skipped right over the " salt & pepper " look and jumped from a dark brown to bob barker in what seemed almost overnight . now , i didn't mind losing my hair color at a young age . . . at least i still had a full head of hair which is more than i can say for several friends , but what i hated was that the grey hair was of such a different texture and feel from my regular hair . it was coarse , dry and wiry . suddenly shampoos like head and shoulders and pert we too harsh , and my scalp felt brittle . 
=================
warning extremely hot ! ! ! ! if you think you can handle try it hot hot hot hot hell hottt ! ! ! ! ! do not use to much its not for the weak try it you will love it too it's the ultimate hot sauce and has more than a little kick to it

stale - oil flavor - - won't buy these again i really loathe having to write a 1 - star review . however , i purchased a 6 - pack of these crostini without ever having tried them before . took one bite and couldn't take another . i don't know if it was this particular batch , or how it was stored in the warehouse . but the flavor i can only describe as rancid - oil . . . if you've ever tried to use olive oil way past the expiration date , and it has a stale taste and odor ? it's how these crostini tasted . my boyfriend , who has a more forgiving palate and less wasteful tendencies than i do , tasted them and agreed . not willing to deal with the effort of repackaging and shipping back to amazon , tossed them in the backyard for birds and squirrels . now , i have tried la panzanella rosemary mini croccantini , 6 - ounce packages ( pack of 6 ) from a local grocery store , and they are delish and addictive . very happy to see amazon offer these . they're on my amazon list and looking forward to replenishing as soon as the store - bought are done ! 
=================
 $ 7 . 37 price increase in 3 months ? ! ? the last time i bought this item was exactly 3 months ago on april 12 , 2012 . the price was $ 28 . 62 , it is now $ 35 . 99 . that's a sharp increase of $ 7 . 37 in 3 months , which is a price increase of nearly $ 2 . 00 per lb . - and when you consider that this product is 61 % sugar , that's quite a price hike . at this price , traverse bay dried cherries costs more per lb . than the trader joe brand of montmorency dried sour cherries which are delicious and come in smaller bags . the whole point of buying bulk 4 lbs . is that you get a price break over buying smaller bags in grocery stores . not anymore . i'm gonna go to trader joe instead and buy their excellent dried sour cherries which are not as oily , and have a nice tartness . * * * update - aug . 17 , 2012 i just bought from trader joe their tart montmorency cherries 8 oz . bag for $ 4 . 29 yummy ! 
=================
good , but not the best out there . after reading the reviews i ordered this item ( 9 boxes ) . it looks and tastes more like regular wheat pasta , but the one disappointing quality of this pasta is that the spaghetti sauce slides off of it , instead of clinging to the noodles . my husband still prefers ancient harvest quinoa pasta , spaghetti style , supergrain , 8 - ounce boxes ( pack of 12 ) which is also less expensive , so i'm eating this to use it up . i won't re - purchase .

squirrels love it ! wish i could say this was a good investment , but it lasted two days before the creatures came back and i saw them digging in my garden . the deer off may be dear off but not squrriel off .

don't waste your money my husband bought this at a local store for us and after attempting to put this piece of crap together , with my son , i definitely have some things to say about it . first off , don't buy this for $ 16 . 95 . my husband got it at a local store for $ 8 . shame , amazon - what's up with that ? secondly - junkiest , grossest crappiest candy and icing ever . the icing was hard , so you're supposed to knead it . so i did . for several minutes , in fact . but it never really got soft enough to squeeze through the hole in the bag like it is supposed to . once i was finally able to squeeze it out , the hole i had to cut made it too big to make any kind of lines anywhere , or do anything but make a big mess . and then ? the icing stuck to everything but the candy and gingerbread . and this is supposed to be edible ? my son tasted the candy - you know , the part the kids are most excited about - and he immediately ran to the trash can and spit it out . i tasted it to see why , and yeah , so did i . this candy tastes like melamine mixed with plastic and chalk . that is supposed to be candy ? are you kidding me ? what chemicals did they throw together in the back basement to make this stuff ? disgusting . do not ingest ! i thought half the fun of making a gingerbread house is getting to eat it - that was m childhood memory . otherwise what is the point ? i could have built one out of cardboard and glue - and frankly , i think that would have tasted better than this stuff . and it definitely would have been better made and easier to build . in short , please for the love of all that is good and wonderful about childhood , do not buy this crapola for your kids . we're going back to the store , which has happily offered a refund , and buying some graham crackers and our own candy and make a decent , edible " gingerbread " house , the way it's meant to be . i suggest you do the same , or at the very least , find one with real food in it . incredible disappointment . 
=================
great cocoa , priced too high while i love the taste of green mountain hot cocoa , the prices for these k - cups on amazon are outrageous . i have seen this product advertised on other sites for almost half the price . i would shop around for a better price . it seems like the vendors on amazon are ripping consumers off . i rated this product 2 stars because of the price . if i was rating for flavor alone , it would be 4 stars . 
=================
sympathy gift tower : product good , but they forgot gift card ! when i bought this ( 11 / 1 / 10 ) , this product was called broadway basketeers sympathy gift tower of sweets ( large ) . i see it's now called " . . . hanukkah gift tower . . . . " in any case , we had a death in the family , so this seemed an appropriate gift . the recipient said it was exciting to open each individually wrapped box and they enjoyed the contents . unfortunately , the gift message i wrote with my order wasn't anywhere in or on the product or package . so , during this stressful time , the recipient and their family had to make many phone calls to various family members to try to identify who had sent it . i felt terrible . i definitely didn't want to put any more stress on them . 
=================
great price , not what i was hoping for though . there's the original tang . there's the fruition tang that was around from 2008 to 2010 , which had extra vitamins ( b , d , a , etc . ) and replaced half the sugar with zero calorie sweeteners . but tang has gone back to a flavor more similar to the original with full sugar content . i was hoping for the fruition version , which other reviewers received . 
=================
torani changed their original hazelnut flavor ! have used the sugar - free hazelnut syrup for a couple years now . just got this 3 - pack and discovered the flavor is waaay different ; and not in a good way if you liked the original . the new product is quite 'artificial' tasting . called torani's and was told that 'yes' the formula had been changed and there had been so many complaints that they will soon be releasing the original flavor again ( which has a richer , more mellow taste ) but under the name 'classic hazelnut' . we will order again when it comes out . . . 
=================
severely dented cans . this is an excellent product . i signed up for the subscription , we like it so much . however , with my first shipment , every single can arrived dented . the problem was not in the outside packaging - that was fine . but the cans , inside the shrink - wrapped case , were dented - on the inside surfaces of the cans ! you couldn't see the dents until the cans were unwrapped . so the problem wasn't in the shipping , at least to me , but in shrink wrapping already damaged cans . will be cancelling my subscription if my next shipment also arrives dented . 
=================
contains ammonium chloride - it's not your typical licorice this licorice contains ammonium chloride . personally i got to like it after a few weeks of testing , but it's definitely an acquired taste ( ammonium chloride ! ) . don't buy this licorice thinking it's regular salty black licorice ( by some cats or coins if you're looking for that ) . 
=================
medjool dates medjool dates good taste but dries out . they are also squashed in the small bag . 
=================
imposter product my cats have been eating this for several years and up to now - have loved it . i have purchased this product from pet shops and amazon . this last shipment from amazon is not the same product as the label claims . when the can is opened , it initially looks and smells like salmon , but underneath the 1 / 8 inch of a top layer of the real looking stuff , is something else . it looks like a wee bit of the real product was sprayed over an imposter product , because it is not the same underneath , nor does it look or smell the same . my cat vomited with the first feeding . my cats don't like it now . they eat the salmon coating and leave the rest . i want to know where amazon got this batch of cans , because it is not dick van pattens natural balance . someone is duping us and we are paying a high price for a fraud . identifiers on the bottom of the can are : nbscp , best by jan 13 15 , the numbers below the sku on the box are : 723633004152 . 
=================
reminded me of dog biscuits when i was about 7 years old my best friend and i tried a dog biscuit , it was a taste i vowed never to repeat . i served these with a lovely vegan dip , then saw the expression on my husbands face . he told me to taste one , i was mortified it was the same flavor and texture of the dog biscuit from so many years ago . my friends were in mid chew no turning back . tiny box , big price and major embarrassment . 
=================
apricot kernals i have ordered the organic apricot kernels . proper research and understanding will dispel fears and knee jerk reaction about the cyanide component . cyanide is used in table salt , fish industry and pesticides . so unwarranted fear is unnecessary . unless someone eats way too many , it should not affect anyone . more people die of drug overdose such as taking aspirin and acetaminophen and than over consumption of food naturally made for us to consume and possibly heal naturally . ironically organic also takes care of pesticides problem . 
=================
this is all i ever use anymore i love this litter because . . . 1 . it completely eliminates urine odor . it doesn't smell like a litter box typically does ( like clay , urine and feces ) . feces do smell right after your cat uses the box , but this goes away . the idea that a cat litter is going to eliminate feces odor right when the cat goes doesn't make sense to me . . . it would have to be loaded with chemicals and perfumes , which i don't want . the odor goes away within a few minutes , and i just scoop out feces at the end of the day . 2 . it is very inexpensive . you only fill the box a small amount , unlike clay litters . i use it along with the feline pine self cleaning litter box , and this is the best value . i only have to buy a new bag of litter once or twice a year . 3 . it does not track nearly as bad as clay or other fine grained litters4 . biodegradable materialswhat would you rather have , a litter box with 3 or 4 inches of clay litter that starts smelling after only a couple of days and is disgusting and must be trashed by the end of the week , or an inch of feline pine , that does not smell and lasts for 2 weeks before needing to be changed ? i almost want to laugh when i go to people's houses and i see their disgusting clay litter boxes , or see people buying clay litter at the store . don't they know there's a way that is not only better for the environment , but doesn't smell and is a better value ? i would also like to note that my cat is one of those picky sensitive cats that will not use litters with a lot of perfume or with a texture she doesn't like . i purchased the generic pine pellets at the pet store once and she flat out refused to use them , but she ok with the feline pine pellets . to those who are saying fp is a " poor value " because you can buy horse pellets at the store and they are the same , first of all i have my doubts that they are exactly the same and break down the same . i also don't understand why it is even an issue , considering that fp is cheaper than clay cat litters and works better . personally i like shopping for cat litter and knowing that i am supporting a good environmentally friendly company , rather than a company that makes clay litter loaded with perfumes and chemicals . note about the price : i don't recommend buying it here on amazon . at most stores you can get a 20 lb bag for only $ 10 , i have even seen them on sale for $ 8 . i would never pay what amazon is asking here . 
=================
none broken in my packages . . . rate product , not packaging anyway . . . very sweet cookie . very sugary , a sugar cookie is more descriptive . . . very good for a sugar cookie though , guess i was expecting a buttery shortbread . . . a bit disappointed . all pepperidge farm cookies have great eye appeal , but they are run by big business . they hop theirs up with too much grainy sugar . . . just tried the milk chocolate chips kind too . . . not at all like homemade , because of the grainy , overly sugary taste . 
=================
food from china is killing our pets ! i used to feed these to my dogs with caution knowing that they come from china . the pet food store i bought them from got all the reports from the company about how good they are in quality . but even now the local * good * pet food stores are not carrying them . they don't want the liability of these items potentially harming and killing pets . it's not hard to do your own chicken jerky , or buy usa products . don't just reduce the amount of these you are giving , just stop giving them . let's buy from reputable sources . remember the pet food from china a couple of years ago that was killing pets due to a contaminant ? 
=================
too pricey i was happy to see varieties of starbucks coffee here in amazon especially my favorite kind , so i ordered it right away . however , i underestimated the size although it comes in 3 bags . but for $ 27 something , i'd rather buy it directly at starbucks stores because they are cheaper there . otherwise , very good coffee . 
=================
rock candy swizzle sticks rock ! purchased these clear rock candy swizzle sticks for my daughter's tea party baby shower . tied pink and blue ribbons around each stick . each shower guest will be given one of the sticks to stir their tea if sweetened tea is desired . these sweets will be a nice touch to our tea party . 
=================
beware : cats become addicts to this . . . just like the whisker lickins brand , cats seem to have a special preference for these treats ! i've tried different flavors and haven't found one yet that they don't like . all 3 cats agree with the review . 
=================
the strawberry tea this tea is just the best ever . i originally bought this tea in london , i struggled to find it here . until i found it on amazon . i have had a subscription for about a year now . the only problem is that the last 2 shipments have been for strawberry sensation and not for the original strawberry they are both good but i prefer the strawberry . does anyone know how to contact amazon regarding this concern ? i wouldn't mind having a subscription for both , but amazon . com doesn't have the option for the strawberry sensation and it's shipping me the wrong type of tea . does anyone know how to contact amazon regarding this concern ? 
=================
my cats do not like it we just moved , and can no longer buy the trader joe's cat food our two cats love . i ordered this because of the great reviews and healthy ingredients , hoping it would help one cat's health . ( he recently had an overnight stay in a vet's office because of tummy issues . ) well , the first time i put it in their dishes , both cats just sniffed it and walked away . later , one cat would take one in his mouth , then spit it out on the floor . these are cats who eat everything ( including things they shouldn't ) and get very excited for breakfast . eventually , they stopped even walking toward their dishes when i poured more food in . one cat was barely eating anything . the other one ( with tummy issues ) suddenly became more interested in eating leaves tracked in the house . finally , i broke down and bought them purina one indoor advantage cat food , hairball and healthy weight formula , 7 - pound bag at the store and they love it . plus the first ingredient is chicken ( not chicken meal or by - product ) , not green peas . right now they're eating half natural balance and half purina one , until they use up the bag . i'm sure this is great healthy food , if your cats will eat it . i did notice that they have very healthy looking stools in the ole litter box when eating it ( gross , but important , i know . the things we do for our cats ! ) hope this helps another person who really loves her cats . 
=================
over priced by far we are now disillusioned by bob's red mill products , based on quality , taste and price . the milk is close to double what we get carnation on sale for ( . 21 / oz ) vs . 35 . . . and bob's does not mix very well , not as well for us , not as easily as carnation . actually we have in the last few months just stopped buying bob's red mill products and have gone for the less expensive items and have found that they , the less expernsive taste as good , have as good quality and are far cheaper . they are like newman's own ; you overpay for image and hype . a taste test for example was done on newmans oreo style vs oreo cookies and the newman came in last . so again , hype and image . . 
=================
arrived leaking the juice extract is delicious . the bottle was leaking when it arrived . there was no inner seal under the cap which probably would have prevented this . 
=================
liked the keurig better ! i bought a tassimo and i bought a keurig and i kept the keurig . the keurig was easier to use with the k - cups and they were much easier to find in the retail market . i also preferred the taste of the keurig coffee selection . 
=================
ok . . . if you like mush ! love the dry formula of this for my dog , but the canned is disgusting . i have gotten many different flavors of the natural balance canned cat food and never does it have this consistency . my poodle is doing great on the dry formula so i thought he would like the canned as well . he couldn't even eat it unless i put some of the dry in with it because it was like soup . i just checked the label and it is the same 78 % moisture as is the cat food so i'm not sure what is wrong . plus , when i gave joey just a tablespoon in his dry food , it made him sick . the ingredients are so different than the dry and i don't understand that . why would they have such a variance in the ingredients of a food for sensitive dogs ? ! anyway , joey loves the dry food and the wellness salmon and rice both dry and canned . their canned is made with much more logic and has the same ingredients in a different order to make the canned . that makes sense to me , not what natural balance has done with this . 
=================
best price the best price i've found . i make english marmalades , jams and jellies , commercially for the farmer's market so really need to research prices so that i can continue to produce ! ! buying through amazon really helps me save on this necessary , but otherwise expensive item . now i have confidence that i can continue to make my great product and earn a little spare cash and serve the local community ! ! saving on this item really helps . thank you , pauline , " morganics " 
=================
very expensive i have tried these in the pet store ( pet co ) and they cost $ 11 dollars there , as i paid only $ 9 + $ 2 dollars for shipping for both pkgs . my dogs love them and they are made in the usa . . . i was using " wagin train " jerky , but it is made in china and there has been lots of uneasy talk about their products harming dogs . so i only look for usa products . only problem is they are way more expensive . 
=================
disappointed fazer chocolate is excellent chocolate . . . but hard to find . so , i was thrilled to find these bars on amazon . however , when i received the chocolate , it seemed like it had been sitting on the shelf for a while , and the expiration date was only 6 weeks away from when i received my order , which was frustrating . 
=================
unusual flavor . . . . . . good thirst quencher . milky and thicker then i expected . not what i would call a pineapple flavor but one can get the idea it is pineapple . 
=================
updated : pup loves it . . . but he managed to break it i picked up the buster cube after reading some positive reviews on it . its a great toy , lots of fun and holds their attention for a long time . i put a handfull of kibble in it ( an amount that my pup would eat in a couple bites ) and he was occupied for at least a 30 - 45 minutes . i would 5 star it but it is its very noisy , even on carpeted floor , thats my only complaint . update : the buster cube didn't make it through the weekend . my dog was able to remove the center piece , and then proceeded to chew on it while i was out of the room . luckily i was only gone for a couple minutes and the center piece is still sort of functional . disappointing . 
=================
microwave your own tapioca puddingl please try that instead this is puzzling , since the pudding by thankyou is currently not available , because i did receive it via amazon about two weeks ago . well , it would have been terrific to give this product lots of stars and kind words . for several reasons , i can't praise this product except to say the label is very pretty , the can has a ring that holds well when you open the can , and the manufacturers use real sugar , not some corn - chemical sweetener . i did open a can of this ; the product is pale , liquid , and uses tiny bits of tapioca . no eggs , although eggs are traditional with tapioca pudding . if it's used again at our house , ( bought a six - pack of this ) some kind of protein powder to perk this up will be needed , and how do you keep it from making your stomach burn again ? the product is " a product of its time " , meaning it is an artificial pudding , very liquid , with artificial colors like tartrazine or yellow number 5 , and sunset yellow , or yellow number 6 . so now you know that if you invite friends and family for dinner and some in the group are on the feingold diet and are sensitive to and trying to avoid artificial colors and flavors , you cannot serve them this . sorry . in trying to make things easier , looks like we have made them difficult in other ways . it might be really neat if you made your own tapioca pudding rather than using this product , and i'm sorry if that sounds like a lot work , but you might enjoy it ; it might take about ten minutes in the microwave , eggs , milk , sugar , tapioca , salt , vanilla . recipes with how many and how much are on the internet . or it can be made in about twenty minutes uninterrupted using a saucepan on the stove , stir in a figure - 8 pattern to avoid scorching , and remove from heat when mixture just comes to a boil . it thickens as it cools . as for separating egg yolk from white , for the fancy meringue version of tapioca pudding , it's a skill that gets easier with time . one may just crack the eggshell and , while not puncturing the yolk at all , hold the yolk in half the shell while the eggwhite slips away by its own weight . maybe this skill isn't the same as sinking a three - point shot from way out ; nevertheless you might enjoy cooking your own pudding . very sorry could not recommend this canned thankyou product . 
=================
old points , bold flavor these individually wrapped thin mints are super tasty ! they don't taste like " diet food " and just one or two completely satisfy my sweet tooth every time . the only problem is the 1 point value ( per mint ) shown on the bag is based on the old weight watchers system , not the new pointsplus system . so if you're currently on the ww program and tracking your points , beware . 
=================
more like essence of cinnamon then cinnamon roll i don't like coffee and this k - cup is one of the reasons why . it doesn't taste anything at all like a cinnamon roll . i need a strong flavored coffee in order for me to be able to drink it . it kind of reminds me of taking medication . i only bought this coffee because i am currently on a diet and this is pretty much all i can have in the morning . maybe it is because i can't have any creamer , but just adding truvia doesn't help the taste of this coffee . with that said if you love chocolate then you will love donut house chocolate glaze donut flavored coffee ( with a couple packs of truvia it taste like eating a chocolate glaze donut ) and donut shop coconut mocha ( omg . . . this taste exactly like hershey's mound candy bar . . . i feel guilty drinking it , lol ) . 
=================
great cereal , but . . . i love my hbos ! but @ $ 4 a box it's not a good value . i bought 3 4 - packs at amazon for $ 9 ea . ( $ 27 ) . they had a difficult journey . each box was damaged , but i got a good deal and they tasted fine . now the price has gone up dramatically ( $ 16 for a 4 - pack ) and i see another customer commented about the poor quality of the packaging when it arrived . i'll stick to my local store . really , look at the price increase ! that's crazy . 
=================
not too hot with a little sweet taste to it i was introduced to this sauce by a mid easterner and it can zip up a bland tasting anything ! add it to beef soup , a bean dish and even eggs . . . . . . 
=================
opening the bag to start it off , it's a good baking mix with good nutritional information . but when i tried opening the actual product , it exploded for some reason and most of the powder bounced out . this bag is also supposed to be resealable but the bag i received isn't resealable . i spent at least a good 20 minutes just trying to seal the bag . other wise the over all product isn't too bad , it works like how you would expect baking mix to work . 
=================
easy to use but . . . s & b wasabi is very easy to use . it is packaged in a nice squeese tube . however , the so - called wasabi just tastes like horseradish made with green food coloring . if you are a picky fan of sushi as i am , it might be best to look elsewhere for the wasabi experience that you are looking for . 
=================
fits nicely into kong it fits nicely into kong and keeps dasher busy . however dasher vomitted after eating it . not sure whether he's not used to this new treat . 
=================
love the product but cancelling my subscription - amazon raised the $ $ i absolutely love this stuff ! i don't drink coffee but used to be addicted to the energy drinks . . . a few years ago a friend suggested that i try crystal light instead - have been hooked ever since . it doesn't give you the jitters , doesn't give you a crash after and you get a whole bottle of water with every serving ! when i signed up for auto shippment in oct 2010 ( 6 boxes every 2 months ) it was an ok deal ( $ 18 w / free shipping ) . then i got real excited when the price kept dropping . the last two shipments they only charged me $ 10 ! ! ! ! stoked ! ! but i just got my email saying my next shipment will arrive soon - but they are now charging over $ 20 ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ummm doubling the price basically over night with no warning ? ? ! no thanks : ( i have cancelled my subscription and will now just get it from target like i used too . . . bummer . . . 
=================
same old fun dip , but limited selection i was disappointed to find that it was only apple and cherry in the pack , and no grape . but it was a good purchase , but i would not buy unless they had a pack with some grape flavoring in it . 
=================
pack of 4 only scammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the package i received only got 4 inside it . be aware of this product since it doesn't have any return option ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

love getting expired food ! i love getting a case of cereal in oct , 2012 when the product expired in june of 2012 ! amazon still shows two in warehouse with more arriving soon so be careful when you order ! 
=================
a sweet little snack i've never reviewed a cookie before this one , but i'm going to do my best to describe the experience of eating it and provide other information that might be of value . these cookies are circle shaped , with their circumfrences probably about half again that of a large cracker . despite the name they're fairly thick . the ingredients they contain are pretty basic and mostly all - natural . a serving size is three cookies , which will not be terribly filling but will probably be fine for those who want a midafternoon pick - me - up or to walk away from a large meal with a little sweetness on the tongue . it's 140 calories per serving and is a bit heavy on the fat ( 5 grams a serving , which comes close to being 2 grams a cookie ) but then , it is a cookie after all . flavor is very much a matter of personal opinion , but i think it tastes great . the brown sugar and dried blueberries are more or less equally present , and the distinct but complementary interplay of two mildly sweet flavors is more interesting than i would have expected from a cookie like this . it's not going to satisfy a hard - core sweet tooth , but then that's hardly what this sort of product is meant to do . texture - wise , it's just a little bit crispier than i'd like , but not to the point that this takes away much from my enjoyment of the product . and , while not exactly moist , the cookies are not at all dry , either . and , since the package seals quite efficiently , i don't see them drying out in the cabinet . my only other complaint is that quite a few of them arrived broken . not only is this a mess , it makes it much harder for me to keep track of how many cookies i'm eating ; and since each one packs a fair amount of fat , i definitely don't want to go over . but , i guess , that's the way the cookie crumbles . 
=================
salty & too much sat fat didn't like it , but , if the manufacturer is listening , it could be saved . go with low fat / low sodium cheese , make the bar slightly bigger and you might even market it as a health food to the vegetarian market . as is , the best use would be to dump it in a soup for taste . 
=================
an alternative form of sweetener xylitol is available from a wide variety of sources . it is a form of tree sugar , originally found in willow trees . it has less calories than sucrose , and metabolizes differently . you would need to consult with your physician if you are diabetic . one of the main attributes of xylitol is that is protects against tooth decay by changing the ph level to suppress bacteria causing both tooth decay and bad breath . rubbing xylitol against a tooth can give temporary relief from a toothache ( but see your dentist ) . xylitol is usually available in both granules and powder form . publications are sold separately giving directions for use in baking .

sweet leaf v . kal i'm sure it's just a matter of taste , but after using kal stevia for years , i thought i'd try sweet leaft . major disappointment . 
=================
i bought it for $ 5 . 00 ! ! ! ! ! i bought this product at tj maxx for $ 4 . 99 . i had not tried it before but wow ! ! ! , the combination of flavors lingers on the palate perfectly . i had no idea of the actual cost until i got to the bottom of the jar . i went back to tj maxx and bought two more . 
=================
tea is great , but amazon's price is not ! i love amazon , and they are always very competitive so i am shocked at this outrageous price for this product . any search engine query for this same brand , product , and flavor will bring in much better prices , around 50 cents a cup . for 48 cups , amazon's $ 39 price tag is just over 81 cents a cup ! i buy other k - cups from amazon , but not for this flavor / brand . 
=================
look at the price ! ! ! you are kidding about the price right ? ? $ 7 . 66 a box ? ? glad you can afford that , i can't . . . . this is by far the best flavor ever , but not in my budget . .

another flavor failure for a healthy kitty treat well , we keep trying different kinds of treats , hoping to find one our cats will eat . we have a 5 - yr old cat who has some hip problems due to a steep fall as a kitten . we thought some glucosamine / chondroitin might help him as much as it helps us . we always bought glucosamine food for our older dog , who very much enjoyed it . anyway , back to the product . first off , it smells very funky , even to my nose ! chicken ? what type of chicken ? our older cat will eat virtually anything chicken flavored , but he won't touch this oneat all . they look like they were cut from an extruder tube , like little dark tynenol tablets . ( i'll take some photos and post them later . i know lots of cats are picky about the shape oftheir food . ) i've tried breaking the pieces into smaller pieces for him - nope . i even tried waiting until he was starving ( like right before dinner ) and he still turned his noseup at them . i then tried leaving some out for a few days , since he likes the dry crunchy treats betterthan moist ones . nope . all he did then was try to bury them . even our little cat , who lovesthe moist treats , would not touch this one . when i pick up the bag , i get a stink - eye look from the cats , and they walk away from me . so , back to the drawing board . some people's cats might like them , but neither of ours would touch them . another expensive mistake . i think hubby and i just need to create a tasty , healthy treat for cats ourselves , because the mfgs are not doing such a hot job in this area . although , i think dogs would probablylove this item .

ehh . i'm convinced these things are a placebo . after taking one per day for a week and noticing no difference , i 5 - hour - energy roofied my roommate's soda before bed and he went to sleep without a problem . maybe if you believe they work , they'll work for you ; they didn't do anything for me . for this price , they should make my eyes incapable of being closed .

i want coffee , not tea ! all these flavor variety packages contain several units of tea . if i want tea i will buy tea . i want a package with a flavor variety of coffees only . where can i get a decent assortment of flavored k - cup coffee ?

fail ! this product fails to repel rats . period . my sister had a rat come down from the ceiling into her cabinet where she came face to face with it eating a bag of rice . it ran and she called me . we took everything out of the cabinet , vacuumed the droppings and then saturated the cabinet with critter ridder . i also went into the attic and sprayed all over . we waited a day , and then when she opened the cabinet to put everything back , the rat was again staring her in the face ! at that point i tried another repellent called repels allbonide 238 1 - quart shot - gun repels - all animal repellent ready to use . i again saturated the inside of the cabinet with it and also sprayed in the attic . in addition , i threw some rat bait into the cabinet . next day , the rat poison was gone , and droppings were left in it's place . repels all had different ingredients but also failed . the guy at do - it - yourself pest control said these items didn't work , but i didn't want to use a trap and have to clean up the mess . at that point i put more rat poison in the cabinet and i can hear the rat eating it right now ! total heebee geebees . i'm not sure if the contrac rat and mice killer is working yet , but i know that the rats love eating it .

strong , but not bitter i really like this blend . i've had a hard time with keurig flavors , but this one seems to fit the bill . the taste is strong , nutty . . . but not bitter . i like a good strong cup . i find many of the green mountain varieties , especially the mild blends , lacking in the bite i enjoy . this one is not like that . i would recommend for those who like starbucks . 
=================
blue mountain is no longer organic or solvent - free until recently , this product was organic and extracted without hexane , a chemical solvent . it was that way when i purchased it from amazon . it even had the usda organic seal on its label . none of this is any longer true . blue mountain sfl is no longer organic nor is it extracted without the solvent hexane or acetone ( nail polish remover ) . apparently , blue mountain lowered the quality of its liquid sunflower lecithin , but not its prices . luckily , the mysunflowerlecithin . com website offers another brand of liquid sunflower lecithin - lekithos . the website has several grades of sfl . it also has a powdered form , but it is only 95 % sunflower lecithin . ( i wonder what the other 5 % consists of . ) i will buy their organic and mechanically extracted sfl next time . it is more expensive but i refuse to buy it non - organic or any soy lecithin - non - gmo or not - organic or not . all sfl are non - gmo , as i think all sunflower products are - so far . nearly all soy products now have gmos .

victor mole traps - out of sight these are much more difficult to set and move than the other victor spear - type models . when " hunting " moles , you must move the traps frequently and this out of sight version is cumbersome . 
=================
disappeared too quickly we have purchased these several times . this past time our dog got it out of the holder and ate the whole thing in less than an hour . too expensive to have it last this short of time . 
=================
sushi making one bite at a time i purchased this product ( 3 packs ) to make sushi for our family of four . the nori or seaweed wrap is very small , a little less than 2 " x 4 " which makes it very hard to make a simple california roll with crab , cucumber , and avocado . once rolled it wasn't quite big enough to cut , but also made a much bigger single piece of sushi . the sticky rice was exremely sticky and we had more rice than what the 10 sheets of nori could take . don't recommend for family dining unless your family is looking for a snack and some sticky fun , however , may be perfect for the single person with time to play or only likes a single item in their sushi . i'll buy the bigger sheets for sushi next time . . . 
=================
not so long lasting i have 2 young labs who really enjoyed these chews , but the long lasting is a little deceiving . i thought it would take days for them to soften the chew and get little pieces off it , but they didn't last more than 2 hours . while i would purchase this item again as a special treat , they are a little expensive for all the longer they lasted with my dogs . i would not recommend this for aggressive chewers . 
=================
excellent product with one overwhelming problem tastes good , convenient , and gluten free . purchased for $ 2 / box at my local wholefoods . the big problem is the oxygen - absorbing packets . i don't like these things in my food . i like the packaging otherwise , but i am a little disturbed after pulling multiple packets that say " do not eat " from my food . yes , multiple " freshness packets " in a single box . real food spoils , goes stale , etc . , and we should not fear that fact . when i encounter too many chemical agents and artificial ingredients , i tend to stay away from the product and make my own instead . sorry about the negative review , but little plastic packets should not be in boxes of food . i sliced open one of these packets , and what came out was fine black powder and brown granules . i am pleased that the amazon product info page currently warns about these packets . the warning is also printed in tiny white letters on the tops of the boxes , although it should probably be listed near the ingredients for the benefit of consumers . 
=================
dosen't taste like tea this tea is actually quite strong compared to the other chocolate teas . i think i would like the tea if it tasted more like tea and less like pina colada . tea shouldn't taste like this . i love the other chocolate teas though they are a great buy ! ( though not as strong d ; ) 
=================
healthy , but not tasty got these free in the newman's own dog food bag . my dogs have been fans of the other newman's treats in the past , but this is a whole other story . one dog played with hers for a few minutes and then abandoned it ( eating it several hours later ) . the other one took a bite and decided she didn't like it . nice to get free treats , but i would never buy them ! 
=================
my sweet tooth isn't quite that sweet wish i could have rated this higher . i respect the newmans and their philanthropy and appreciate the fact the product is premium organic ingredients . i was looking forward to trying this 54 % chocolate bar . i eat a little dark chocolate daily and found this was too sweet for my taste . ( to be fair i have had the same problem occasionally with a couple of other brands i've tried over the years . ) i usually buy green & black's 85 % dark chocolate or endangered species 72 % dark chocolate . someone who is used to milk chocolate might like the newman bar better than i did . as for comparing nutrition facts , all three bars use different portion sizes . . . so i didn't find it worth the effort . newman's 2 . 25 oz . bar is considered a single serving . green & black's 3 . 5 oz bar is considered 2 . 5 servings , and endangered species 3 oz . bar is two servings . 
=================
safer moth control is no good i have returened the item because it didn't catch any moth fly in 15 days while another brand i got on the same purchase was filled with stuck moth flies . ( springstart biocare ) is the best . it keep catching more and more moth every day . 
=================
you might as well buy cornflakes i enjoy the occasional bowl of frosted flakes , but like everyone i also like to cut back on my sugar intake . so when i saw this reduced sugar version , i decided to try it . unfortunately , the lack of sugar on the flakes ( which i did not miss ) made the flakes completely soggy once they hit the milk . for this reason , you might as just buy cornflakes , which do hold up in milk . i agree that you don't miss the sugar , however , the taste isn't as strong either . 
=================
despite the organic labeling , not all that healthy a choice " salmon + crackers " is advertised as a " ready to eat meal . " at just under four and a half ounces net weight it 's more of a snack than a meal , but leaving that aside , i found many other issues with this product . it's further advertised as a balanced meal featuring a number of organic components . but a look at the side panel tells the tale : 410 calories , 150 of these from fat ; 5g saturated fat ; 660mg of sodium ; and 48g of carbohydrates including 21g of sugar . healthy ? not even close . the only redeeming feature is 22g of protein . there are five components in the mix . there's a bag of dry roasted edamame . if you're not familiar with edamame , it's a popular asian snack or appetizer . the dry roasted edamame in the gopicnic package were very dry indeed and had suffered a huge loss of characteristic flavor . next is the ginger zip fruit and nut mix . i found this to be at once too salty and too sweet . i suspect a lot of the sodium and sugar was in this package . then we have the late july organic classic rich crackers , which are quite similar to ritz crackers . there were six of them ; they were fresh and crispy with a nice crunch and bite , and not too salty or sweet . the gopicnic chili lime salmon spread is , obviously , made to spread on the crackers . more than enough spread is provided for the six crackers , though you'll need to have remembered your own knife or something to actually do the spreading . there was a nice chili taste , not too strong , and a clean lime taste . but the salmon spoiled it all . there were little shreds of salmon and one big chunk ; the mix obviously wasn't mixed very well . and it tasted much more like sardine than salmon . the fish had an " old " taste and smell that was very unappealing . the package was completed with a terra nostra organic robust dark chocolate square , which had a nice bitterness and strong cocoa flavor ; it was perhaps a bit strong on buttery mouth feel , but it was really quite good . if you're thinking of getting these to serve to children , that may not be the best idea . they won't like the salmon spread and they likely won't like the edamame . if you're thinking of serving these to adults , there are probably much better , healthier options . it wouldn't be all that hard to make up your own package with tastier , healthier , and more substantial contents . i can't recommend the gopicnic salmon + crackers . it's neither healthy nor particularly good . 
=================
flavorful , but difficult to store and use i had been using this product to make homemade nicaraguan chorizo . this product is indeed flavorable and authentic . however , i found that it dries out and hardens before i have the chance to use all of it , even if kept in the plastic bag it's packaged in and then sealed inside a tupperware container . for this reason , i now order annatto ( achiote ) powder instead , and add additional flavorings to it , according to a recipe in one of my nicaraguan cookbooks . i figure i can't get more authentic than to use a cookbook that was published in nicaragua ( not here in the states ) and use the exact ingredients the recipe calls for . i can also control the ingredients to avoid unnecessary preservatives and such . 
=================
need a better method of shipping although these candies did have a very good flavor i was very disappointed . i had to dispose of almost half because the candies were crushed ; i assumed it was poor packaging and didn't go through the hassle of trying to get them replaced . i just think it is probably something that needs to be purchased locally instead of by mail . 
=================
it was only okay . this product didnt really make as much as a difference as i would have liked ! 
=================
wow ! ! awesome . . . wow man ! ! awesome price $ 1 . 99 for 6 mangoes and roughly $ 12 shipping . almost right price matching with my local store here selling for about $ 12 - $ 15 for 6 mangoes . . oh wait ! then why am i giving 1 star . . or maybe negative star . am i missing something here ? of course , duh . . price is $ 199 & for some reason no free shipping ! ! friends , don't buy it here . if you plan on buying 36 mangoes , then for that price , you can go round trip to india , stay for a month , eat delicious / fresh alphonso mangoes daily , give remaining 6 to this spiceworld site and ask them to sell it to one customer at reasonable price so they get 1 + rating by at least one person ! !

looks and smells gross , but my baby wouldn't stop eating it ! our pediatrician recommended this flavor combination when we first started solids because it has 120 % of daily iron needs . well , when i sat down to feed it to my baby , all i could was , wow , this is so gross ! it looks pretty much the same way going in as it does coming out , if you know what i mean . to my surprise , my picky eater gobbled it up ! she ate more of this than any other baby food flavor we had offered . a 2 - 3oz package of anything else was lasting two days , but she ate almost the whole 3 . 5oz package of this in one sitting . i did taste it , and the apples make it sweet and appetizing ( and i really do not like spinach ) . we've had more success with ella's kitchen than any other brand , but this flavor especially has been great . looks gross , smells gross , sounds gross , but i say , give it a try . 
=================
ridiculously overpriced on amazon but great product hence the 1 star crunchy , not too salty , always very fresh when i've bought these at publix . publix has them on sale from time to time for $ 4 . whole foods price is usually around $ 5 . no idea why you buy 3 and pay about 100 % more . amazon needs to evaluate the price - perhaps should be a 8 pack for the same price . 
=================
no caca i'm always leery of buying seasoning mixes because of the monosodium glutamate , weird sugars , and unpronounceable ingredients . i don't like buying the individual spices because by the time i get back to using them , they will probably be way out of date . with these " inspirations " from mccormick , i don't have to measure and i've got exactly the spices i need . i hope this product will stay around . 
=================
new formula fails i started using cytomax back around 2001 , and it was the most amazing sports drink i had ever had . taste , performance , ease of use ; it had it all . i read the reviews here discussing a formula change , and went ahead and gave it a shot . i'm halfway through my newest container , and it's just not working . the taste is subtly off , and viscosity / texture of it is subtly off as well . finally , and i have no way of explaining this at all , i think it actually gives me a light headache when i'm drinking it . performance - wise , i think it generally still works , in that it provides some calories and hydration for longer workouts . but i don't like drinking it . all said , i will never buy it again . i will test out accelerade lemon lime 60 servings and hammer products , etc , and see which one is the best , and go with that . new formula fails . 
=================
red everywhere ! i love the concept of the color mist . i purchased 3 bottles of the red mist to decorate 75 cupcakes . the mist went on very easy , but because i wanted a darker red i had to keep applying it . to say the least , i am not a big fan right now . . . since my kitchen now has a red residue all over the counter tops ! : - (

the company has covered this product in candy sweetness . milk had no taste . the company has covered this product in candy sweetness . milk has no taste . better than the other products competing with milk .

good flavor , but tooooo sweet the walnut & date has a good flavor , but it's way too sweet . my husband has a sweet tooth and he also thinks it's too sweet . i ate one bar last night and it made my stomach uncomfortable . 
=================
certainly not what you'd expect . . . for a ball of rice paste full of bean mush , it's certainly much tastier than you'd think . . . . the red bean paste ( which is the traditional filling for many japanese snacks ) is very sweet and thick , almost like preserves . . . except , it's bean paste , so it has a slightly gritty texture that takes some getting used to . they are pretty rich , so i don't think i'll be able to more than one in a sitting . . .

not for my geriatric dog with gastrointestinal problems my elderly 13 + year dog has experienced gastrointestinal issues for the last two years and i have to be very selective in my choice of treats . i was hopeful this digestive support treat would work out . i gave him one a week for 4 weeks and every time , within 12 hours , an incident followed . though i can't directly connect the two ( treat = incident ) , 4 timing coincidences was enough for me to stop short of giving him the last 2 treats . he loved them . . . which is why i gave them two , and not one , stars . but for a treat advertised as providing digestive support , at least for my dog , this is a 2 star product . 
=================
don't bother with this fig jam ! i have become obsessed with trying every fig jam and preserves and chutneys i see available . they are truly wonderful with goat and sheeps milk cheeses . there are many brands which are simply wonderful - unfortunately this one is not ! the flavor is not rich and figgy - it tastes diluted and flat . the consistency has too much gelatin in it so it is not smooth and creamy as it should be . i keep my fig preserves in the refrigerator for ages - and they never , ever go bad - i had one in there for over two years . this brand however , actually went moldy after a couple of months ! ! good riddens to the most disgusting fig jam i've ever had ! now for some recommendations for delicious brands : bonne maman fig preserves ( france ) is widely available and very nice - creamy with a nice fig taste . the adriatic fig spread ( croatia ) is very widely available - it has a rather bright , fruity taste , a bit more tangy - but also nice . l'epicurien ( france ) makes a bunch of fig products - some which i haven't tried yet - but the one i have tried is their fig and walnuts confit . it is pricey for the size ( only 4 . 4 oz ) but it divine - really indescribable - very rich and intense - somewhat sweeter than regular fig preserves - worth trying at least once . and finally is the vergers de gascogne fig jam ( france ) imported in us exclusively by williams sonoma - and as far as i know - only available in their stores - not on their website . this one is amazing wonderful - a classic - call them and find out how to order . i have another 6 brands in my pantry ready to taste - but too soon to recommend . but don't waste your money on this one - that is for sure . . . 
=================
healthy alternative - mixed taste review i want to preface this review and say that if you want a really healthy alternative to pasta then you may want to try these . my husband really likes using these for a zero calorie option . i , on the other hand , will not eat them . they still have a fishy type taste and the texture is very different . no matter how we prepare them i can still taste the weirdness and would rather have the calories from real pasta . my husband has an easier time getting over the taste and taking them for what they are . for health nuts who can't or won't eat real pasta this would be a good product to try and see if its something that you enjoy . 
=================
hormel's chili master each person has their acquired taste for chili . the added tomato flavor makes this a big hit for me . however , the price is outrageous . this same item can be found elsewhere on internet for less than $ 3 per can . this sells at $ 5 per can . i'll pass based on pricing alone . 
=================
wal * mart 4 . 95 you can buy this at walmart for 4 . 95 for a kit . i got burned last year , i paid 19 . 98 for 1 of these . 
=================
this sellers price is a rip off you can get this at wholefoods for 8 . 99 . dont buy from this place . they are taking advantage . when amazon did have it in stock , it was 24 . 99 for 3 ! ! as for the produce , it is the best ! deep dark choco flavor and it's perfect for my morning banana sunbutter protein smoothies . 
=================
coffee been home roasting for two years now . i use an i - roast ii , but stop by sound , sight and smell . i would not recommend the light roast that the company claims it is blended for . the mixture of bean types and sizes just do not really allow all of the beans to roast to same level . this is true of a darker roast as well , but at least all the beans make it to / through first crack . not the best blend i've experienced , but satisfactory . i roast at fc + , with some beans falling into the french roast catagory . tough to beat the price and the beans were dry . i'll buy again , but not too soon . may give some of their others a try . arrived very quickly . that impressed me . i usually buy from sweet maria's but their arrival is usually about a week or so . my decision to buy was more out of a need to get some beans quickly , as i was down to my last couple of roasts of the beans i had left . give this one a try . it may be to your taste . it will still certainly taste better than folger's , no matter how melange the roast . 
=================
disappionted but pleased with the refund . this was my second order of this product the first order was outstanding but the second was terrible . hope the manufacture can return to the original quality . amazon needs to test and promote the quality of this product if / when it is restocked with good quality . 
=================
migraine food ! sure they're tasty , but they trigger a migraine in msg sensitive people . also , they contain corn , which also contributes to their tastiness i'm sure , but seems silly for a " rice " chip , which is what i thought i was buying to avoid corn . 
=================
decaf the product is probably fine , but i failed to note that it was decaf . i got excited about the price and flavor ( my wife's favorite ) and failed to notice the decaf . unfortunately i am now stuck with several unopened boxes i can't return due to the return policy that would not exist if i just paid regular price in a store . no problem with the coffee ( my wife loves the regular ) , just be careful as you can't correct for quick reads . 
=================
misleading product description - note that this is a blend ok . i admit it . i didn't scrutinize the full product description nor study the picture of the bag before purchasing this product . i purchased this product thinking that it was 100 % kenya coffee . nowhere in the product title or in my invoice did it say it was a blend . you had to look at a closeup of the bag or read through the romance description in order to get an inkling . even then , they use the word blended in the description which can have a different meaning than the word blend . why is this important ? there are no worldwide standards for what percentage of a coffee's orgins are needed in order to make a claim . for example , kona coffee does have a standard for blends , where at least 10 % needs to be sourced from kona in order for it to be called " kona blend " . in this case , as long as there is some kenya coffee in this product , copper moon can call it a kenya blend . amazon should make this clearer . 
=================
from the label : . product contains high quality extra virgin olive oils from italy , greece , spain , tunisia and turkey . percentages from individual countries not indicated . 
=================
where's the smoke ? ok . i was all puckered up to really like this version of smoked olive oil ( i thought the one i'd been guzzling was the only one in the world ! ) . i figured at the rate my family consumes the smoked olive's local brand ( they literally put it on almost everything ! ) , it might be worth saving a couple of bucks ( after shipping it wasn't so much cheaper after all ) . i was excited the day it came ( like 10 days after my order ) and got out some of my homemade , wood - fired oven baked ciabatta bread . a big sloppy dip ( i like olive oil ) on a hunk of bread entered my mouth and . . . what happened to the smoke ? there wasn't a whole lot of smoke to begin with , but the initial flavor literally fell off . like some poorly executed wines that just have no character . yeah , i'm spoiled and prejudice living in sonoma county where the best artisan foods are found . i guess this is a perfect example of " you get what you pay for " . 
=================
lovely basket , poor delivery time this basket was purchased as a gift for a grieving family . i'm sure the basket was beautiful although we did not see it ourselves . i paid for expedited delivery so that it could be received within days of the funeral . however , it did not arrive until one week later , the same delivery time as regular rates - that was disappointing . 
=================
the only coffee i can drink , but ouch the price ! this is the only coffee i can drink . any other decaf upsets my stomach in the middle of the second cup . unfortunately , it is very expensive at just under $ 5 per tub . that price is ridiculous , and when i see it here for more than double what it is at the grocery store it is really outrageous . 
=================
strange little nut ! i love these nuts . i have been eating the cocoa ones . tried these for the first time this week . i found all five nuts , cashews , almonds , walnuts , pecans , & brazil nuts . but there also is another nut in the mixture not listed . looks like a macadamia nut . but doesn't seem to taste like one . so we really have six nuts in our canisters . lol great not have the peanuts . 
=================
it's like drinking bile i really like their regular tomato soup , so figured i'd try this . well , life is all about figuring out what you like and don't like , so i'll take this as a lesson learned . the good thing is that it tastes the same going down as it does coming up . 
=================
uh - it's mac - n - cheese it's a different box , but the ingredients look , smell and taste the same so what's the big deal . it seems to me that all this is , is the same old product in a new box . ok , new and improved ( ? ) box . but the inside seems exactly the same and the preparation and taste are the same . it's sad to think that some one in r & d at kraft said , " hey , let's add the word veggie or vegetarian or vegan to that old standby mac - n - cheese and see how many people we can fool into thinking that it's a new product " . so i'm cynical . . . can you blame me . zeb kantrowitz

wish i'd saved my money i second the reviews that say not worth it . my dog popped the treat out within minutes and has already eaten half of it . i don't think this will keep her from eating my shoes after all . 
=================
not too bad for a can even though i hate sugar in any coffee beverage , this is pretty good . at 45 calories a can , there are probably 3 teaspoons of sugar . that's kinda hefty , but it doesn't taste that sweet . while it has a pretty strong flavor , it certainly doesn't have the robust , fresh ground flavor one may expect from illy . and , it tastes like it's been sitting in a can , because it has . maybe they'll ship in glass and solve the metal aftertaste issue ? 
=================
beware they taste fine but definetly not peach . they're a bit softer than haribos , which i prefer . the sweetner used causes a laxative effect , fast acting i might add . it would be different for everybody but for me i can safely eat 7 or 8 rings . if you exceed the amount your body can tolerate you better plan on staying very , very near the bathroom for an hour or two . if you need a laxative these work well but you'll be sorry if you eat too many . not for children !

=================
sweet n' low liquid my family uses the sweet n' low liquid . we like it very much , not only because we are cutting out sugar , but also the convenience ofturning up a bottle for a few drops of sweetener instead of havingto open a package and wonder how much to put in our coffee ! for convenience of ordering click on amazon . com and go to grocery . gloria wells

box of useless bags , great customer service i purchased a large order of these bags ( 9 boxes ) , and the first box i opened were totally useless - one of the three sides wasn't sealed . of course i didn't discover this until i was outside trying to pick up poop , but that's the way the world works . i emailed biobag and received a response within 10 minutes offering to replace the box , so that was fantastic . we'll continue to purchase these for our little poop machine .

snow's clam chowder by bumble bee i am a long time fan of snow's condensed clam chowder and found that the bumble bee company has obviously changed the original recipe . i was disappionted in this product and hope bumble bee will strive to get this product back to it's name sake's quality . the doxsee company has got it right . 
=================
decent noodles but not gluten free these noodles contain wheat - - which last time i checked has gluten in it , so i guess it is obvious that you should not buy if you are allergic to wheat . the non - allergic people in our family ate the noodles and they taste like normal noodles but are green . nothing too exciting .

dinty moore meatball stew purchased for elderly mom . texture of product soft , takes seconds in a majic bullet to furthly reduce texture . easy to remove flip top lid to can . good taste . . . i was suprised .

if you like tikka masala , this is the difinitive sauce mix . i first bought sukhi's tikka masala curry paste at the livermore farmer's market in california . i was hoping it was edible . it was way more than that . it's as good as any restaurant , in my opinion . i was once making it for dinner when a friend dropped by my house and stood next to me over the stove as i cooked it raving about the smell . now she buys sukhi's , too . 
=================
these tend to be good i've had four or five of these cans , and the olives are consistently decent , but not great . they're appropriate for the price , and very pleasant . the last can i received was a mess , though . there were no herbs whatsoever , and every single olive was inferior , be it discolored , mushy , or with borer holes . i think they accidentally packaged the rejected olives . major bummer , but how the heck did that make it past quality control ?

french roast , but not the best roast summary : if you're looking for a dark roast with full flavor for your tassimo , keep looking . hey - - it's maxwell house after all . check out the newer gevalia dark roasts . detail : after starbucks severed its relationship with kraft , i was looking for a decent brew for my tassimo brewer . the maxwell house french roast was kraft's early attempt at this , and it disappoints . it's ok if you stop the brew short , but it's a bit weak if you let it go full cycle . it's arguably the best maxwell house offering , but it's no starbucks . conclusion : if you miss starbucks , but want to keep the flexibility of the tassimo , check out the three gevalia dark roasts ( breakfast , house , and italian ) , as these more closely resemble starbuck's breakfast , house , and verona blends , respectively . these three form the core of my one - cup brewing , supplemented by a number of espressos and cremas available ( mastro lorenzo being my fav ) .

the real 5 stars i have bought six plants from hirts gardens . one was infested with mealy bugs & thrips , 2 were sent bent , broken due to not packing the plant correctly , most of them had brown dry leaves and even leaf spots . ive posted this review before and i received an email from hirts stating please remove my review cause it hurts there business , i wasnt even offered an apology on any of the issues . then i notice that hirts some how has deleted all of the negative comments on some plants that i posted but have not deleted the positive comments on the other plants . so this is why they have so many five stars because they are taking out the negative comments we as customers post . ( very dishonest of hirts garden )

vanilla aroma 4 / 5 , actual vanilla taste 1 / 5 i'm going to admit i'm a coffee addict but not a starbucks fan . assuming you like starbucks coffee ( if you don't know . . . just go to a shop before you buy a package ) , this is a drip grind , medium strength . it's definitely not a french / dark roast . it wouldn't hold cream well at all without over - powering it . that said , there is barely any vanilla taste to hit although the grounds have a strong vanilla aroma . in general , a hazelnut coffee has about 3x the flavored taste as this does . yes i do realize vanilla is a much more subtle taste . i would recommend either adding a drop of vanilla extract , shot of vanilla syrup or vanilla cream to your already favorite cup of joe .

they're ok , but not great . i was sort of excited to try these because licorice is one of my favorite sweets & i'm always eying up new flavors to try out . this just sort of seemed a natural fit for me as far as a vine review goes . the good thing is that the texture to these are pretty good . it's nice & chewy without being too chewy or too soft . it's a happy medium , although i do recommend that you try to get these as fresh as possible since i can't imagine trying to eat these when they've a little old or have been exposed to air & not stored properly . the bad thing is that these just have this funky aftertaste to them . the basic taste is fine enough . it doesn't taste like pomegranate & normally i'd be ok with this since candy often labels things " watermelon " or " strawberry " when it doesn't taste anything remotely like the fruit . since this is supposed to be mostly organic & natural , i really expected it to taste more like actual pomegranate . then there's the occasional weird aftertaste these have to them that's somewhat unpleasant . i can't really explain it but it's not a taste that i'd really care to have in my mouth . one thing i do want to mention is that out of the 11 ingredients in this product , only 3 are organic . that doesn't bother me much , but i know that there are some people who get irritated at how some labels mention " organic " but only a small part of it is actually organic . at that point you really can't call the product organic since it has non - organic product in it . ( there's no usda organic label on this anywhere , if you were wondering , which can only be put on if a certain percentage of the product is organic . ) note that this product didn't have " made with organic ingredients " on it , just " made with organic sugar " . the people who label watch for organic products will know what that means . i mention all of this because i know some are very picky about product that have organic anywhere on it . overall i wasn't really that enthusiastic about this product . it wasn't horrible but i can safely say that i probably won't be buying any of these in the future . i might & i stress * might * try one of the other flavors , but that'd only be if the price was right . edit : updated to say that i won't be buying any of this in the future . the licorice i ate later is really making me feel a little gross . like another reviewer said , it's just sitting there like a pile of lead & is giving me some pretty bad indigestion . if you have a cast iron stomach ( which admittedly mine isn't as strong as it once was but is still pretty good ) , then you probably won't have a problem with this . this has to be the first licorice product that has remained unfinished in my house ever .

horizon organic plain organic milk , 8 - ounce aseptic cartons ( pack of 18 ) regular reduced fat milk from horizon received slightly over a month away from the expiration date . my intention was to buy whole milk but the product description is confusing . i sent an email to the customer support - no response , after 3 weeks i checked and found that they made the picture larger ( good ) but left the product description without change . as for me , it is crazy expensive shipping while i can get same fat free or reduced fat milk at stopnshop or market basket . the difficult thing is to find whole milk . funny that whole milk as natural product became unpopular . i guess too many people are concerned about becoming overweight : )

not bad ! i bought this for my dog that doesn't play , but loves to eat . so i was hoping this would entertain him , but even this wouldn't do the trick . however , i broke it back out after i adopted a new dog for christmas . she eats her food much too fast , and in return has horrible gas . so , i started filling this with her kibble , and it slows her down , and keeps her busy for a good ten minutes . my older dog still won't play with it , but he will indeed follow her around and pick up any kibble left behind ! lol

disappointing . . . i've always preferred dark chocolate . ( not surprisingly , i don't care for chocolate made with dutched - - alkalai - treated - - cocoa . bleh . ) in college , i used to go out after dinner for a hershey's bittersweet bar . ( it was more bitter than the current special dark bar . ) i was expecting something spectacular from scharffen berger's 70 % - cacao bar , and was ( sorry ) bitterly disappointed . their description - - " bright fruitiness and a long , smooth finish " - - is accurate . ( the lingering bitter taste is especially pleasing . ) but there's insufficient " complexity " to justify a $ 5 price . the taste isn't sufficiently " better " ( or more - adult , if you like ) than a much - less expensive hershey bar . definitely / not / a treat to be savored , one small bite at a time . a " good " chocolate bar , but of questionable value . see if a friend will give you a bite before you commit to buying .

great sweetener , nice lemon scent , where's the lemon flavor ? my daughter brings flavored lemon water to school everyday and i was looking for an alternative to her splenda based lemon water . i thought this would be a great solution . unfortunately , even though this is a very nice sweetener the lemon flavor is barely detectable . the scent is great though ! in tea this is fine , but as a sweetener / lemon flavor enhancer for water , this is not a good solution - stick with real lemons and stevia .

yikes ! $ 7 . 77 for one 8 oz . bag i wish amazon would sell mahatma red beans with rice by the case - - two dozen bags ( or more ) would suit me . paying $ 7 . 77 for one small bag is simply not economical considering i want to cook some more often than once in a lifetime . the five - star rating is for the product , not for the means of obtaining it .

a 20 dollar sham after two years in my bin , i uncovered black moist compost and . . . wait for it . . . . un - decomposed green bags . what the heck ? " compostable " bags that do not compost . have returned to putting everything in my compost can and just dumping into the composting bin and then rinsing - out the can . and after some research , you discover that these bags are made from corn ; corn that is mostly fertilized in the us from derived petroleum products ; great i'm composting and contributing to greenhouse gases all at the same time !

not really a gift pack . i purchased this " gift pack " for my cousin as a christmas gift . he loves hot sauces and i thought this would be the perfect " usable " gift . while he was very happy with the sauces ( before even tasting them ) , i was disappointed at the fact that this item was listed as a " gift pack . " when i think of a " gift pack " i think of something that is nicely boxed or packaged . what i received was a shipping box with 6 bottles of hot sauce , each individually wrapped in packing paper to avoid damage during shipping . they're fine - don't get me wrong - but not very presentable as a " gift . "

they changed the recipe . thye're not as good now . late july recently changed the recipe for their dark chocolate sandwich cookies without any direct notification on the packaging . they disappeared from the shelves in the denver area and when they reappeared , they were different . the new recipe isn't nearly as good . there's less of the intense cocoa taste that we enjoyed . they're drier . the cookie is more like a dry , less tasty cracker now . sure they're marginally healthier - a bit less fat , more whole grain and fiber , less sugar . that's fine , but the taste of the cookie has been compromised such that they're just less tasty , empty calories now at 50 calories a pop . we originally switched from newman's chocolate creme filled chocolate sandwich cookies to late july's because they were so much better . now they're not as good . we live pretty far from the denver area so we stock up occasionally . since there was no obvious notification of the recipe change on the packaging , i bought our usual supply for a couple of months . mistake ! i'll be donating several boxes to the local food pantry . hopefully , someone will enjoy them !

a first - rate cuppa java ! for what it is , i . e . , instant coffee , this freeze - dried concoction by nescafe , certainly delivers . according to the label , this coffee is processed from 100 % colombian arabica beans . . . the good stuff . now , obviously , you're not going to be fooled into thinkin' that this comes across as a melitta - drip kona brew . . . and it doesn't . but , if you're not lookin' to impress the neighbors [ or lord forbid , the relatives ] with the aroma of fresh - brewed , then this instant should serve you well . it is smooth , flavorful , and relatively robust . . . not as much as starbucks via , but very close . on the flip side , since the nescafe does not contain micro - grounds , it doesn't have the muddy texture of the via . as for preparation and clean - up , it couldn't be easier . . . zip , zap , pour , and stir . . . two minutes , tops . lastly , at less than two - bits per serving , the nescafe is at least three times less expensive than the via . there's yer 'bang - for - the - buck' . . . take that '4 - bucks' ! amended [ 21 jun 12 ] please be advised , that this product is not exactly as advertised . nescafe is engaged in some deceptive advertising schemes . on the coffee box , you will find claims like : " tasters choice colombian coffee is made from 100 % colombian beans . " . . . and . . . " tasters choice colombian coffee is made from the finest arabica beans . " now , i have no reason to doubt that these two statements are likely true . however , taken together , they imply that this product is made solely from arabica beans , which is , in fact , not true ! notice that they did not say : " made exclusively from arabica beans " . if you read the on - line product description , you will discover that this coffee is actually a blend of the superior grade arabica beans and the inferior grade robusta beans . think 'cya' disclaimer ! that certainly helps to explain why this coffee does not have the 'finestind' flavor and finish of my eight o'clock colombian roast . caveat emptor ! the instant coffee quest continues . . . stay tuned . . .

gave my puppy very loose stools we began feeding our 10 week old german shepherd puppy blue buffalo large breed puppy food , transitioning her from purina very slowly over the course of several weeks . initally she seemed to do fine but then began getting very loose stools . we couldn't even pick up after her . it was terrible . we took her to the vet for tests , added pumpkin to her diet , vet gave her probiotics , nothing seemed to help . after about 6 weeks of this ( and working unsuccessfully with my vet to find a solution ) i switched foods . in about 3 days her stools were nice and solid . while the ingredients in blue look good on paper , it just wasn't good for her digestive system . now feeding california natural lamb and rice puppy and she's doing great on it .

it's a poor substitute for fresh ground i really wanted to like this coffee . i wanted something that i could take to the office and use with my aeropress coffee maker or use when i wanted a quick shot of espresso without grinding the beans . however , i guess once you start drinking fresh ground you cannot go back to buying ground coffee . the date on the bottom of the can is over a year away , but the coffee still smelled stale to me when i pealed the metal top off the can . i tried it a couple times in my saeco made espresso machine . the crema was weak and the flavor was thin and slightly bitter . i poured it down the drain rather than finish it . i prefer illy's dark roast espresso , but my local grocer no longer carries it , probably because it did cost more than any other brand . i guess i should have heeded another reviewer . my favorite coffee is peet's and i think french roast is the peak of perfection . i like the beans dark and shiny . this coffee was a medium brown color , not the dark brown that i'm used to . there's a reason why espresso shops freshly grind the coffee , it really makes a difference and is worth the extra time , expense and effort . the baratza maestro plus is an excellent cone burr grinder ( . . . ) . it will give you years of service . i've tried cheaper ones and they just eventually die .

awesome product , wish i could buy it in stores i don't know what is in these things , all i know is that our dog can't stop eating them . if her teeth didn't look so good since she i started giving her them ( and if they weren't so easily digestible ) , i'd feel bad that i enabled a checkups addiction in our dog . she's a forty - pound mutt , and i give her one - half of a checkup after breakfast and dinner . . . if i wait too long to give her the treat , she starts whining and moaning until i pull one out of the container on the kitchen counter . then she runs to her bed and waits not - so - patiently for it . . . yeah , she's a weird one . : - ) like many other reviewers , i used to buy these at costco for about half the price , but had been unable to find them at either of our local stores . i contacted both diamond pet foods and costco about it . diamond said that costco rotates the availability of many of is products , discontinuing items for a couple of months then bringing them back . they suggested i let costco know that we liked product and wanted to see it on a permanent basis , but in the mean time that i could buy them from amazon . costco said the item had been discontinued , making no mention of it being a rotating product , but that they would pass my message on to their buyers . if you want to see these back on the shelves in costco , send them an e - mail or drop in a note in the suggestion box at your local store about it . the more customers they hear from , the better the chance they will bring them back . diamond also suggested another one of their products , bright bites , which are similar to checkups . they come in three flavors - - peppermint , wintergreen , and cinnamon - - and are available in retail stores ( you can find a list on their web site ) and amazon . i don't know if our dog would dig the flavors , or if switching to them would be any less expensive than continuing to buy checkups from amazon , but maybe i'll try them out some time .

this product has changed ! my family and i have been enthusiastic consumers of this granola for years . we even switched grocery stores when our old one stopped carrying it . i'd say we went through about 2 bags a week , pretty regularly . recently i have not been able to find my familiar package at the store - - like the one pictured on amazon . instead the grocery store carried only the new " clusters . " disappointed by the change in structure and recipe , i went to amazon to see if i could get the old one back . i was pleased to see it pictured - - the old one , not the clusters . so i ordered six packages of the stuff . instead of getting my old favorite granola , i got the darn clusters . we are hanging on to the granola we got from amazon ( it's not so bad that i need to send it back ) but unless the old one returns , count us as " used to be customers . " the clusters , which is what you'll get now , have far fewer nuts in favor of what seems to be less expensive fillers . not fans of the new and " improved " clusters .

disappointed overall i gave this as part of a secret santa gift for someone who loves to make guacamole . i was suprised to see that it's a condiment that you must refrigerate and use within a few days once opening rather than a dry seasoning . i paid too much for it given the cost of shipping only to find it available at my local waldbaums supermarket . i bought some for myself to taste what i had given as a gift and was simply not at all impressed by the flavor it added . this surprised me as i have seen chef bayliss' show on tv and expected something more . i should have known better . guacamole isn't difficult . avocados used at the right stage are delicious on their own . use cilantro , some sort of acid , lemon or lime , chopped onions , tomato and salt and you don't need anything else . 
=================

reviewing my previous statement the product i received is completely different from the one i ordered , the quality is extremely poor for its price . i do not recommend this product . that was my previous statement due to the fact that for mother's day the provider that flowers . com used had sent an extremely poor bouquet that seemed was thrown together at the last minute . i did take a picture and sent it through amazon and was delivered 2 days later an adequate bouquet just like the picture . i was very happy with the second vase full of flowers and for this i would recommend it but my husband was very unhappy with the fact that on mother's day he had to hand me the previous mess that was sent . try to not take on more orders than you can correctly deliver because that is when the name and quality of your company gets damaged . all in all the final vase that arrived was beautiful and hopefully they will keep true to the picture portrayed .

not working for us anymore my cat has been eating this brand for about a year with no issues . ever since they changed the kibble shape , my cat has been vomiting after his meals . i'm guessing they must have changed more than just the kibble shape because something is not agreeing with him . i have been trying to figure out what else could be the issue . he is very healthy and i see no other changes in him . he is still his very energetic self which makes me think no health issues are to blame . i've changed his food and so for no vomiting .

not enough mint flavor , overly sweet and cloying i'm a big fan of mojitos . they're one of my " go - to " cocktails when i'm out and about . as such , i admit that i'm a bit of a mojito snob . i hate when a bar tries to pass off rum and lemon - lime soda with a sprig of mint as a mojito ; i call that a faux - ito . however , trying to keep the ingredients for a good mojito fresh at home is a challenge , so i was excited to try the new crystal light mocktails mojito mix . one thing that surprised me right away was that the instructions do not provide ratios for using this mix with alcohol . they only provide the non - alcoholic instructions . given this , i decided to try both alcoholic and non - alcoholic variations . for the alcoholic mojitos , i used a ratio of 1 750ml bottle ( roughly 3 / 4 of a quart ) of rum added to a 2 quart pitcher filled 3 / 4 with ice . then i added the mix and water to fill the rest of the way and used a stick blender to mix . for the non - alcoholic mojitos , i used the ratios specified on the package , again using the stick blender to mix it thoroughly . in both variants , i found the mix to be overly sweet and artificially tart tasting . it reminded me of a sweet / sour hard candy . i could not detect the mint at all . if it was there , it was overpowered by the other flavors . considering that the muddled mint is what truly differentiates a mojito from other beverages , that was disappointing . while the alcoholic variant cut the sweetness slightly , it was still overpowering . i was not able to finish the glass i poured myself of either concoction . ( note : regarding the sweetness , i've generally had this opinion of other crystal light mixes . if you're familiar with the brand , i'd say this is on par with their usual sweetness at the recommended ratio on the packaging . ) i decided to go away from their recommended ratios and do my own variants . i eventually settled on using 1 quart of seltzer water with either the rum and ice ( alcoholic ) or regular water ( non - alcoholic ) for one packet . using seltzer instead gave the concoction a nice fizz , but admittedly , it did also remind me too much of those faux - itos at mass market establishments . you could get the same effect by simply using diet lemon lime soda , e . g . , sprite , and muddled mint . ( actually , that will probably come out better because the mint will come through . ) overall , i can't see myself buying this again . i'd rather make the real thing or simply have a different cocktail instead . this feels like a poor attempt to cash in on the mojito trend .

boo i say , tabasco lies . first off , allow me quote the label . " tabasco habanero sauce is made from the world's hottest pepper . " what ? ! that's funny , i don't see the word 'jolokia' nor 'scorpion' anywhere in the ingredients . how is it legal to make such a blatantly false claim ? false advertising aside , i bought a bottle for thirty - five cents at my local grocer after it was on sale and had a coupon which doubled . the moment came and i shook the bottle into my mouth for a swig . . and . . . nothing . minutes later , another big swig ; a third of the bottle now gone . i waited patiently to no avail . maybe others would have been impressed with the hint of capsaicin , but not me . so , thankfully i didn't pay much for this tiny bottle of disappointment . yes , i am a shu snob , and if you need to look up what " shu " is then this sauce is for you . even tabasco's website , which doesn't require a recall to correct , is loaded with inaccurate [ read deceitful ] claims . i've had hotter jalapenos from domino's pizza than tabasco's attempt at a habanero sauce . stick with the simple pickled red pepper juice and market your black pepper water toward the mainstream tabasco ; you're way out of your league . that said , this sauce is great for adding to baking soda and making cool volcanos with my kids . certainly not worthy of gracing my breakfast . but hey , this is just my opinion . much like tabasco's opinion on " the world's hottest pepper " ; no real merit . worth noting , this is only the second time i've ever been compelled enough by a product to take the time which i have little of to share my opinion .

too tough ? hey , it's jerky ! although i was a little put off by a prior review that indicated this product was nearly inedible , we had purchased this salmon jerky at trader joe's in smaller packets and really liked it , so we decided to purchase here at amazon much less expensively . yes , this product is very dry , but it also has none of the preservatives included in some of the more moist jerky products out there . my family liked it , and we are placing a second order . that other reviewer should send her inedible seven extra packages our way !

a distant runner up to monster not a fan of no fear . it has a very sweet & fruity soda flavor with an unpleasant aftertaste . it left me feeling dehydrated and cotton - mouthed instead of refreshed and energized . energy drinks for me are few and far between . i will continue to stick with monster on the occasions i pick one up though .

total ripoff ( and mistake on my review ) see my last post before reading . i wanted to cook a gumbo that called for a tablespoon of file powder . never having heard of this spice i , i looked all over my town and could not find it in any spice sections of the local stores , so i ordered here at amazon for $ 11 . 95 the next day when i was at the local fish market i found the same sized jar for $ 2 . 50 . never having used the spice , i have no comment on its quality , but this is way overpriced . if you can't find this spice locally , do a internet search to find another seller . this should not be this expensive .

great cookies if they are fresh ! nabisco snack wells creme sandwich cookies 1 . 7 oz . ( pack of 12 ) 20 . 4 oz . neti purchased these cookies in the store several times and thought they were a great alternative to other indulgences . when i saw them on amazon , i thought it would be a super savings . however , these cookies must be fresh , or they are simply not worth eating . the photo above is a very good sample of some very old and dried out cookies . when they were received in fresh condition , they were excellent , with soft moist cake and marshmallow and a chocolate coating that was a solid , shiney dark brown . in this photo above you can see a very dried out product with an old and pale , discolored coating . i ordered 3 seperate times , 1st box was " great " other two were not even edible . 1 for 3 makes them a very poor value . nabisco snack wells creme sandwich cookies 1 . 7 oz .

read the fine print on the box of quinoa ancient harvest supergrain pasta while this pasta tastes better than many whole grain pastas , i am giving a ranking of 2 because although the packaging strongly suggests this product contains a significant amount of quinoa , the actual amount of quinoa in the corn - quinoa blend may be just slightly greater than the amount of dried spinach needed to color a few of the pieces green . so don't have your decision swayed by the side or back panels , which detail the wonderful nutritional profile of quinoa and its history of cultivation . note that the company's website states " our corn / quinoa gluten free pasta is primarily a corn based product . " so maybe they should be putting the word " corn " in the big print ?

difficult to use . this came in 2 pretty big jars . i opened one and it was completely white . after a week or so of using it , i saw small black patches of what looked like mold on the surface of the surface . so i scraped it off . but within a couple of days , it grew back . i thought it was disgusting . didn't want to throw such expensive oil away though . so i refrigerated it . when refrigerated , the oil is hard as a brick . it's really difficult to scrape out chucks for use . i mostly use this for pan frying eggs , veggies , meats , toast , etc .

a lot of money for what you're getting . . . . . while these are a nice cool treat for your dog , it's much more economical to make your own . these containers are super small . just mix together some plain yogurt , ripe bananas , blueberries , peanut butter and whatever else your dog likes , and you can make a lot of treats for the same money as this tiny bit .

be aware , this came as be aware , this came as a single box . i thought i was buying a 6 pack for that high price . i love the tea , but buy it straight from twinings if you have to pay this price .

we thought we were doing our best my wife and i thought we were doing our baby a favor by going organic . we switched from similac to this formula and it's hard to say if the issues we had were because of this formula . . . . after a 10 day half and half schedule we noticed less pooping and violent screaming after eating . since this is our first two kids ( twins ) we can't say if it's the formula but something didn't seem right . then a friend emailed about the controversy of the synthetic additives in this formula . . . do your own research , but we have since switched to baby's only ( too early to tell if it's cured the issues ) and we feel better we have steered clear of the fact we might be doing more harm than good . so frustrating ! here is some info to help in your research . seems are some issues with dha / ara additives . eb's ingredient list below . . . have you looked at baby's only ?

maybe a little bit of both , but there is no doubt i'd never use earth's best again . . . . nothing worse than seeing both your daughters screaming after eating especially when you thought you were buying something good for them . . . . they need to remove that crap from this product .

not very strong on the bergamot scent one of the reasons why i love early grey tea is the scent of bergamot oil and the strong black tea flavor . this tea , was no earl grey . it was more like assam , with a hint of bergamot oil . if you like earl grey , i suggest you try mariage fr & egrave ; res french blue earl grey or adagio's earl grey . if you like organic , try mighty leaf .

an insult to the consumer for starters , i'm not an anti - splenda fanatic . i've been a user for years , and despite internet sites claiming that splenda is the equivalent of radioactive waste , my hair is still thick , my brain still works , and my doctor says all my organs are just fine . that said , splenda with fiber is one of the silliest insults to consumer intelligence out there . the envelope that splenda with fiber comes in is much more rigid than the standard issue packet , and appears to be foil reinforced . it is so stiff that you can't do the customary snap of the wrist to move the powder to the bottom , so that when you tear open the packet you don't make a mess . no luck with this packet , which might stop a bullet if placed in your vest pocket . next , the powder sinks to the bottom of your favorite beverage ( mine being coffee ) . . . . and stays there . it does not dissolve instantly , in fact it puddles at the bottom of your cup . if you happen to zap your coffee in the microwave , it carmelizes : a thick , slightly brown , hard to scrub out goo becomes adherent to the cup bottom . a gram of fiber in every packet ? come on , splenda people ! a bit of corn ( corn is the source of fiber in this product ) in your morning beverage is not where you want to go nutritionally ! if you get your fiber from whole grains , fresh fruits , fresh vegetables , you also get the added benefit of vitamins and anti - oxidants . if you get it from your artificial sweetener , you get . . . a brown gooey mess at the bottom of your cup . and , splenda with fiber costs more than regular splenda . i'm a family physician , and what the splenda people appear to have done conforms to a very familiar pattern in the pharmaceutical world : as the patent expires on the original medication , modify the product slightly , get a new patent , and keep charging the higher ( non - generic ) price . sucralose is now generic / off - patent , and available in multiple brands cheaper than splenda . argh . eat healthy foods . exercise . forget paying significantly more for 1 gram of fiber in your splenda . this product is dually hampered : it under - performs , and it is an idea that makes little to no nutritional sense .

great in moderation aunt jemima's original maple syrup , this is in all meanings of the word a " silf .

great pistachios , terrible packing i received this bag broken , the pistachios were all over the box , i contacted amazon to return them to get a refund to then order them again , but since i left them open in our kitchen table my partner came and started eating them , by the time i noticed she had about a cup of them so i felt i couldn't return them . the box was in good condition so the damage was not in transit , i am not sure how the bag was so broken but the only explanation was that it happened while they packed them . on another note , my partmner didn't get sick from eating them but we didn't want to take a bigger chance . i do like this brand since i ordered the smaller bag before and that is why we decided to get the bigger one . 
=================
sorry for breaking the perfect record i was gonna give it a three , but i ate 2 more of them before i wrote my review and the second changed my mind . the image shown on the box is very misleading i must say . the actual chocolate looks dry and has a chalky texture . the taste is pretty good , but after reading the exuberant reviews it got , i was really disappointed . it's chocolate with nuts - fine , but it just didn't met my expectations . i bought some hersheys chocolates at the same time that was much cheaper and had much more content and honestly i enjoyed the hersheys much more . that is only emphasized by the fact that the hersheys are all gone and i haven't even completed half this box . good chocolate , but nothing that special .

all dented up - its true i'm cancelling my subscription to these as the come all beat to hell . not from shipping , the cans in the middle of the 12 pack flat were the most damaged . drank them this time anyway though . i also found a store that sells blue monkey for less than the subscription price .

be very careful of price ! ! most stores are selling this for about $ 4 . 70ish . one seller on amazon was selling for $ 13 . 00 a bag : $ 79 for a pack of 6 . no way ! ! 4 . 70 x 6 should be 28 . 20 . don't over spend on this yummy product !

good , but no cigar . . . i enjoy this coffee mixed half and half with my preferred non - flavored variety , where it adds a hint of excitement and indulgence to an otherwise ordinary cup , but i have found that i prefer not to drink it alone as i am generally disappointed . it is good , but doesn't have the bold flavor and depth of other chocolate raspberry coffees i have tried . also , the grind is almost too fine and tends to 'clog' the filter when i brew more than half a pot . 
=================
pasteurized kombucha . get real . i was looking to see what amazon had as far as kombucha goes and came across this drink . i did a little research and realized this stuff is pasteurized . i must repeat - pasteurized . one of the main reasons to drink kombucha is to bring beneficial bacteria into the gut to balance gut flora to aid digestion , nutrient absorption and to fight off bad bacteria and other invaders . pasteurization kills this bacteria rendering them useless . there are still plenty of b vitamins in the drink that the body may still utilize even after pasteurization . if you are buying it for taste and the small amount of b vitamins , go for it . if you are buying it to nourish your body and introduce probiotics into your system , forget this product . instead , make your own kombucha , check out raw brands such as gt's or other local brands ( in madison wi we have nessala which is raw , nutritious and delicious ) or invest in some refrigerated probiotics .

tastes fine , but what's the benefit of alkaline water again ? i received one bottle of this water to review . it tastes just fine , not a lot of flavor from the added minerals in the bottle . this seems to be some preliminary attempt at the alkaline bottled water market . the label indicates " ph is 9 . 5 + / - ( purified waters require calibrated ph meter for testing ) " which implies to me that they don't yet have a calibrated meter . . . anyhow , the health benefits , if any , of the water are hard to assess . most mineral waters have more flavor and are also going to be moderately alkaline .

crying over spilt soup somebody should have warned me that one of the campbells enjoyed juvenile humor ala three stooges . as the previous reviewer states , put it in the micro , turn it on and wait about 16 seconds for it to tip over . i tried it twice , the second time i placed the can in a deep bowl and it still fell over . i know i need to clean my microwave more often , but twice in 10 minutes is a little excessive . this was the shortest subscribe and save on record . oh , if you want to know about the soup , i couldn't tell you .

smokehouse beefy sticks price rip - off ! how can this company honestly & realistically justify a price of $ 16 . 32 ? ? ? since i can purchase the exact same locally in seattle at fredmeyer ( division of kroger ) for $ 4 . 99 ! ! ! was looking for add'l sources on this item due to it being my dog's ( missy a maltese ) fav treats and its tendency to be in low / short supply .

beware - amazon limits the total amount you can buy the food is great . the cats have gotten completely addicted to it . but . . . . what amazon doesn't bother to mention is that " quantities are limited " . i have been buying this food for my 3 cats for about 6 months . it comprises roughly half their diet ( or 3 cats / day ) . i just went to re - order and was repeatedly told " there's a problem " . long story , and 2 phone calls plus 2 emails later , i was told i have bought the lifetime maximum of this product . i ordered it for almost twice the price via the marketplace , but i am furious with amazon . nowhere on this page do they tell you there's a limit . so i'm here to tell you there is . the food is great , but don't get used to buying it here .

saved by another reviewer baking soda is amazing stuff . so , i almost bought this , in my head picturing the 4 lb box . then i saw a complaint by another reviewer about how very small the box is and realized that i was making the same mistake as that amazon reviewer ! thanks , helpful stranger ! ! i cancelled the order : the price was way , way too high for the same regular sized box available for much cheaper in the departments stores around here . but , i did later buy a bunch of these little 1 lb boxes in bulk elsewhere online . a box of this does wonders for my gym locker , and a larger box would not have fit . i also like to keep a little box in the kitchen for dishes in need of hand washing that have an unpleasant odor for some reason . 
=================
flat i love several of the other santa cruz organic sodas ( lemon / lime & pomegranate / lime are awesome ) , but i don't care for this one at all . it has a root beer flavor , but something isn't right about it . it has lemon juice in it which seems odd to me , but i think the biggest problem is the low amount of carbonation . even a freshly cooled can tastes like it's been left open all day and then put back in the refridge . the less carbonation works great in their fruity drinks , but not this one . also , at a 130 calories per can , you will not get skinny drinking this stuff . 
=================
come on . . . . please ! too much , not enough , needs this and that . this was the surprise i wasn't expecting , and i almost put them back on the shelf . the reason i am here is to look for other nuts with the salt and pepper ( and onion ) . i was hoping you had peanuts with the same additions . you have a winner here , try it with other nuts .

amazon sent wrong item again amazon sent the peach flavor not the cola flavor beware . too much hassle to send them back for less than $ 20 but what a pain the crappy quality control in the warehouse is . peach flavor is pretty tasty but not what i ordered . 
=================
good for a packaged convenience food make no mistake . . . this is a pre - packaged , instant convenience food . that said , it's quite good for what it is . also easy to make : add water , microwave one minute on high , stir , microwave 4 minutes on low . i prefer that method to the microwave 2 minutes , let stand 10 minutes directions of many other dr mcdougall's soups . unfortunately , my microwave doesn't have a high or low setting so it was just a little dry by the end of the last 4 minutes . i'd probably do 2 or 3 minutes for the second microwaving and see how that goes next time . i also think the packaging is a little misleading . it looks similar to the packaging of products like annie chun's udon soup noodle bowl in which you have more of a bowl or meal tray that contains noodles and flavor or sauce packets . it is in fact a soup cup to which you add water and flavor powder . i assumed the higher price ( vs regular dr mcdougall's soup cups ) and the description of 'entree' meant it would be more like the former , with actual noodles and sauce . the noodles are much more like ramen noodles . that aside , the flavor is good , though i much prefer the dr . mcdougall's right foods asian entree , spicy kung pao noodle flavor , as it's a bit spicier ( though still fairly mild for someone who likes things very spicy ) . not bad but i probably won't be reordering . 
=================
great milk but horribly overpriced i always purchase this milk for my son's lunch - he loves it , but how can you really go wrong with chocolate milk ? ! my only complaint is that this product is horribly overpriced on amazon . i purchase the exact same product ( 18 count ) for under $ 12 at costco . plus if you factor in shipping cost - - yikes , you could easily spend $ 3 for each little box . before you do that , i would suggest buying organic milk at the grocery and adding a dollop of hershey's syrup .

picture does not match package ! i was disappointed when i received the package of freeze - dried zucchini because it is smaller than pictured ( by about one - half ) and there are no directions how to reconstitute or ideas for use . 
=================
not quite worth it when i first saw this in the store i thought it was a great idea and a possible time saver , even at the higher price than other traditional litter boxes . the extra money would be worth the time saving . when i brought it home and started to use it i was disappointed . first , the grate holes in the sifting screen are too large and so much of the smaller clumps fall through you have to scoop anyway . the clumps that fall through are so small that they fall through a regular hand - held scoop as well , i had to find a strainer that would work . also , the grate gets easily clogged and you have to clear it out . the other thing that i find really annoying is that the lid system does not seal well so litter was falling out the back as my cat tossed litter around in the box . this added a chore that i never had before , cleaning in back of the litter box . all in all i don't think this product has saved me any time or made the job of cleaning out the box any easier . it actually created more work . i will replace it with a traditional litter box and send this one to the recycling bin . i really would not recommend it . 
=================
yellow peas i needed some yellow peas for a polish receipe . i really didn't want 10 pounds of them , but that's the only way i could find them . their taste is not terrific . i have used them in some other recipes . i suggest mixing them in with lots of other things , like in vegetable soup . i still lots of peas left . wonder if i will ever use all of them although they don't seem to deteriorate much over time . 
=================

so disappointed they no longer are making this exact coffee ! this beats every other hazelnut k cup out there now the company has changed the formula and are calling the new hazelnut " vanilla hazelnut " . its good , just ok but not as full bodied as this . if you get the chance ( and i don't see it first ) order the original . its so worth it ! 
=================
delivered steaming hot i have used this yogurt culture many times before and it makes great yogurt . however , my local store stopped carrying it , and i ordered these cultures from amazon . i am a prime member and chose a 2 day delivery . the package arrived steaming hot ( it was over 90f outside ) and was not packaged any differently than a non - grocery item . i did pick up the package as soon as it was dropped off by the ups carrier . first batch failed , and so did the second batch . i am assuming that improper delivery destroys the culture and do not recommend purchasing it from amazon . a local store had it in the refrigerated section with yogurts and probably had it delivered accordingly .

be aware of packaging ! ! i had ordered the spaghetti & it was wonderful , so i ordered the pasta . i knew it was coming in a " bulk " order , but i didn't expect it just thrown in a box ! it comes in a large cardboard shipping box . when i opened it , there was a flimsy plastic bag with the 10 lbs of pasta . no advertising , no individual boxes . the bag was ripped in several places and the pasta fell all over like those annoying packaging peanuts ! i like the product , but i just didn't know i was going to have to find several storage bags to keep it in . just be aware !

good price for green tea , 4 bags per foiled pouch i'm trying so hard to drink green tea for health benefits . had a bigelo 20 bag box , individually foil packed , and bought this bulk pack to save money . this huge pack contains 4 bags per foil , for freshness . price was far better than bigelo site , or others online , so bought it . found them in sam's club cheaper the next week . each tea bag is designed as one upright sack - - different from the folded / split bags in my previous bigelo 20 bag box . these tend to float and require more effort to disperse compared to the previous bags with twice the surface area , in folded pouch design . it is what it is . to me , green tea is about the most disgusting tasting thing i've ever had , and i hope it grows on me because this is an exercise in sheer discipline . i just hate green tea , but can't fault this product for that . entire family hates the smell of it , and loathes any taste of it . i hope it is an acquired taste . . . this is straight green tea w / no sweetener or mitigating flavors .

tastes ok but . . . i like the fact that this product is all organic and tastes ok but is very salty . if you use this product , you pretty much can't add anymore salt to your dish . i prefer the taste of seitenbacher's vegetable broth powder over this - it has more flavor and is far less salty . don't get me wrong , this is a fine product but if you want more flavor , less salt , go for seitenbacher ( i wrote a more in depth review on that product's page ) .

oops ya thats right , oops , not my cup of tea , not enough flavor to suit me . but it is quick and easy in a pinch . sorry

cats like it but not at first it took about a year before the cats would gave it a try , then with in 2 month it was gone . when i first got it , they sniffed it and that was about it . now it is like cat nip to them but more smelly . i just ordered some more , maybe it has to set for awhile & ferment when 1st opened . . . i know it was not as smelly when they liked it & went kokoo over it . it was more potent smelling when freshly opened . but my cats are odd , they like sticky buns , cake , marshmallows , mexican food & sandwiches with all the fixings besides there normal diet of diet eukanuba & canned cat food .

quality going down hill each bag i've received has gotten drier and less appealing . the last bag i received was mostly crunchy , so after a call to navitas , they sent me a replacement of another item . i've been ordering another brand that is pesticide free and about as juicy as rasins - i love them ! i still love navitas' chocolate products .

irritant this milk tastes good , but contains carageenan which is a cellular irritant . carageenan is suspected to be implicated in colon cancer , and possibly other cancers since it irritates other than gi tissue . the same company has a carageenan - free version , called rice dream , original , classic . it's a great alternative to this one . not quite as thick , but otherwise tastes the same . 
=================
may taste delicious , but now comes from china polar jarred fruits used to come from mexico . they are now coming from china . i can attest that these strawberries do taste very delicious , but i am concerned that chinese regulation is still weak , and that pesticides and hormones are being overused on a large scale ( see the story on exploding watermelons from 2011 ) . i have also noticed that when they started coming from china , the price dropped ; something wrong with a product being shipped all the way across the pacific , and being cheaper than coming across a land border from mexico .

the original is available i've always avoided the lea & perrins brand due to using hfcs but today i was in the store and i was happy to find lea & perrins " all natural " it uses sugar instead . seek it out if you want the true original .

my dog won't eat anything else my pom is very finicky and i tried giving him some other dog food ( good quality ) and he turned his nose up . as soon as i put this back in his bowl , he started eating it like he really enjoyed it . he knows when something is cheap quality because i have totally tested him . don't think you'll be disappointed . 
=================
doubled the price i bought this last month 12 bottles for 13 . 95 and now this month it is 21 . 00 . why did you double the price . its good , but not worth 2 . 00 a bottle . i understand price goes up 10 % but 100 % . . . this is not good . won'tbe buying you tea again at this price . 
=================
very little flavor , i was disappointed you'd think you can't go wrong with a basic staple like rice , right ? unfortunately , i was disappointed with this rice . lotus foods madagascar pink rice was described as having a hint of spice flavor such as cinnamon or clove . i didn't pick up on that in the slightest . in fact , this rice had very little flavor at all . i normally buy brown basmati rice , or lotus foods forbidden rice which are fantastic all by themselves . those rices can be enjoyed without a speck of salt or other seasoning added . the madagascar pink can't begin to compare . i wish this had been available in a small package instead of an 11 pound sack . i read the full description on the lotus foods website and i liked the idea of this rice . the amazon subscription price was a great deal , so i went for it . i'll still eat the rice , of course , but it will be served in recipes that don't depend on the rice for flavor like other whole grain rices provide . 
=================
not good food i had my dog on this food until he developed an infection in his anal glands . my vet told me not to use this food anymore because it is made in china and the glucosamine in the happy hips formula provides no benefit to my dog because the amount of glucosamine is too small and its not a high quality . he had us switch to royal caninroyal canin dry dog food , giant breed adult 28 formula , 35 - pound bag - so far our dog is doing really well with this food , firmer stool , loves to eat it , etc . and for the glucosamine / chondroitin / msm we are using dasaquinnutramax dasuquin with msm for large dogs - 150 tablets which is a pharmaceutical grade supplement , same manufactorer makes a supplement for human consumption as well . do yourself a favor - buy a solid supplement and a dog food that is not produced in china . 
=================
lacking in taste and texture this kitchens of india discount purchase was disappointing . it is lacking in taste and texture . while the product has a lot of salt , i stilll found it rather tasteless . the curry's texture was not pleasant . many curries that i enjoy most are thick and have a tomato paste type texture . this one was watery with semi - mashed up chunks of vegetables . it was not pleasant on the tongue and even combining it with rice and naan did not make it something i would want to eat again . this product is packaged in the ever - popular pouch inside of a box . i don't really like pouches because the contents are usually difficult to remove . true to my previous experience with pouches , i had to use a spatula to remove the contents that had stuck to the pouch's walls . another reason for my disdain of pouches is they are not typically recyclable . nutritionally , this product is lacking . each container has 2 1 / 2 servings and a serving is about ½ cup . so , let's look at the numbers for a container , which would realistically serve two people when paired with rice , naan , or vegetables ; the total fat per container is 37 . 5 grams , total sodium is 2300 mg , total saturated fat is 6 . 25 grams , total carbs of 40 grams . i've found kitchens of india products to be hit or miss in terms of taste . i like jyoti products ( come in a can for the most part ) mtr products ( come in a pouch ) better . disclaimer : while some jyoti products ( their saag , for example ) are healthy , mtr products are typically full fat but at least they taste better . this product is vegetarian but not vegan . this product is made in india . if you really want to try this product and only want one pouch , consider iherb . com . you can use code lek375 for a discount . 
=================
well it's better than the black cherry anyway this is my second can of " the switch " that i'm reviewing under the amazon vine program . and while this one is perhaps a bit better it still has the same basic issues - - it's over priced at almost $ 1 for a mere 8 . 3oz can in a 24 pack , but more importantly it really just doesn't taste like orange or tangerine at all . the ingredients actually list apple juice as the first type . now why would you put apple juice in an orange drink ? now don't get me wrong , it tastes exactly like one would expect carbonated juice to taste . . . but the flavor isn't all that appealing . i love orange juice , drink it every day . i'd love to try carbonated orange juice . . . but this is far from that . it might be a good substitute for normal soda for kids , but i can't imagine any other real reason to get this .

problem cider had a great taste and i was so happy to be able to purchase sugar - free k - cups . . . however , when i opened the box , two of the cups had puncture marks already in them , rendering them unusable . i took my chances and used the rest of the k - cups ( after inspecting them ) but was upset , knowing that this product i had purchased had been tampered with . 
=================
lower salt i like the product but you will have to taste it to see if you like it too . one star off because it is overpriced .

burgess seed co . dba directgardening . com i highly recommend folks avoid burgess seed and directgardening . com at all costs ! they have been charging orders on credit cards and not filling them ! ! ! they send form letters to avoid refunds and you get the " talk to the hand " if you get through to their poor customer service . there are so many complaints against them and we for one are filing with the better business bureau -

really runny and virtually tasteless - - but hey , better than nothing on my high protein waffles i enjoy the nature's hollow jam / preserves so much - - am having some right now between typing , the blueberry over fage yogurt , and it's so good - - that i figured i'd give the sugar - free syrup a try . um . not so great . i made high protein waffles and i usually use either natural applesauce , a homemade berry compote , or smucker's sugar free breakfast syrup on these babies . today , i chopped up strawberries and used this syrup . so disappointing . the flavor is slight , slight . a hint of mapleness . the sweetness is okay . the texture is watery . now , i can live with a ightweight , watery texture if you pump up the flavor . : ) but this one , not so much . for now , i'll stick to my smucker's sugar - free ( though it's not perfect , it's been the tastiest fake maple syrup that has a genuine thick consistency ) . or , occasionally , i just cave and have real maple syrup . ( i'm not on a low - carb diet , i just try to avoid sugar when possible . ) i think this may serve better to use in fruit mixtures to then top waffles or pancakes or to flavor plain oatmeal . this syrup will sweeten stuff up with a light maple flavor , and while it was kind of a fail on my waffles , i can see that this might work better to flavor my slow - cooked oatmeal . that's why this gets 2 stars instead of 1 star : whilte it failed for me as a good syrup for pancakes and waffles , i suspect it will be good as a maple flavoring agent . and this one is way better than the maple grove farms one and the davinci one . for low - carbers , worth trying , even if not very satisfying substitute for the real thing . i hope nature's hollow reformulates the syrup adding more maple flavor and thickening it up a bit . i'd retry their product if they did .

ok the gum is ok . the taste last for about a minute so one has to keep popping new pieces into mouth . it is also very sticky once it is taken out from mouth . but it doesn't contain all that bad stuff that other gums have . 
=================
price keeps increasing . . . i have enjoyed this product for quite some time . however , i am disgusted by the fact that the price keeps increasing ! at $ 35 per case , customers are paying more than $ 4 per box for 5 small cookie bars - ridiculous ! i will find a healthier , more reasonably priced snack to munch on . shame on nana and amazon . . . 
=================
actually . . . i think this stuff is pretty good . i've had a few bags and have noticed that the " toughness " varies wildly from bag to bag . the thing is , just about all of the other turkey jerky i've ever had tastes amazingly fake and rubbery . this , while potentially tough , just tastes good . i used to get it at trader joe's , but they've since replaced it with their own store - label line . . . it's horrible . just horrible . so now i turn to amazong . . . 
=================
salt . . . if it's so bad , why do salt tablets exist . . . . i do lots of muscle testing . . . and found that la baleine salt consistently tests better for people than any other salt . . . celtic salt can test well . . . but is not always a good product . . . there is the theory that vets give cows salt licks as farmers have to keep their cattle healthy . . . they can't afford lots of medicines . . . books like your body's many cries for water . . . also talk about salt . . . regular grocery store brands and most health food store brands test weak on people . . . keep your health balanced with lots of water and enough salt . . . the right salt . . .

keurig k - cups sampler gift pack i was disappointed with this sampler pack because i thought it would have a lot more flavored decaf ups than it does . i thought when i ordered it , it did , so , when i received it and opened the box , i was very disappointed . if you want a lot of dark roasted decaf cups than this is the pack to get . if , however you're like me and wanting to try out flavored k - ups , then you'll be sadly disappointed . 
=================
great product , terrible packaging . . . beware . . . no complaints about the chips , they're great . however the box arrived from ups half open and when i opened it completely , i found one chip bag had exploded and all the other 23 bags were crushed or semi - crushed . so much for that ! not blaming amazon or ups but next time this happens , i will return the order . 
=================
tasty but way too salty ! i purchased this when it was a lightning deal last week . i love indian food and was excited to try this . it's tasty and easy to prepare . however , it is very salty ! the label says there are 480mg of sodium in 1 / 4 of the package ( which translates to 20 % of the recommended daily value ) . the next time i make this i'll have to add more than the 1 cup of water that's in the instructions . i also ended up adding about 1 / 2 cup of yogurt to take down the heat of the spices . i don't normally have a problem with spicy foods , but i felt this curry was more on the hot side despite what other reviewers said . 
=================
be careful or you will get fat - or fatter : - ) this is not a health food ; but i probably didn't need to tell you that . the first ingredient is sugar and the second is palm oil . i just received and openedthis treat and had my first cookie . if you like reese's peanut butter cups ( who doesn't ? ) , you will probably like these . they taste almost exactly like areese's but are shaped like a cookie and have a thin cookie crust on the bottom . so , to describe it , it's a cookie crust bottom with peanutbutter on top , then the entire cookie / product is covered in like a dipped chocolate similar to what you'd get if you went to dairy queen and had your vanillssoft - serve cone dipped in chocolate . they use the word " fudge " on the packaging but i personally would not claim that they have a fudge - like taste . betcha can't eat just one - lol
=================
very tasty , but needs more nutritional value sure i love the taste of the sugary sweetness of this cereal . tastes like frosted flakes with honey and nut mixed in . unfortunately , with no ( ok , less than 1 gram ) fiber , they don't provide the nutrition that i need . the nutritional panel is basically carbs . . . 11 of 26 which are sugar . i kept eating , but i never felt full , but i sure did get a ton of empty calories . i can't recommend this to anyone looking to eat a hearty breakfast . if you are looking for corn , sugar , peanuts , and honey ( first four ingredients ) and don't care about nutrition , this cereal is for you . for everyone else , look elsewhere . full ingredients : ( look at all the sugar ) milled corn , sugar , peanuts , honey , malt flavoring , molasses , salt , high fructose corn syrup , caramel color , iron , annatto extract color , niacinamide , ascorbic acid ( vitamin c ) , sodium ascorbate ( vitamin c ) , pyridoxine hydrochloride ( vitamin b6 ) , thiamin hydrochloride ( vitamin b1 ) , riboflavin ( vitamin b2 ) , vitamin a palmitate , vitamin b12 , folic acid , bht ( preservative ) , vitamin d , wheat starch .

5 stars for flavor ; condition upon delivery - mess these add a creamy , thick flavor to almost anything but once in a while i experience a very strange aftertaste with the chocolate flavor , usually when i use 2 vs just one in my beverage . the packaging , however , leaves a lot to be desired and unless you want a lot of work when this arrives , you might want to rethink this purchase . in recent weeks , i've purchased 3 cases of this product ( that is 12 boxes of 50 single serve cups ) in 3 flavors for the local emergency shelter here in western , ma due to the tornadoes that ripped through my community and those of my family and friends . i am so thankful i looked at this product before just bringing it to the make - shift kitchens and coffee setups on the back of pickup trucks . this is what i experienced . what follows is actually my 'cut and paste' comments from one of my 'leave packaging comments' for amazon , so it lists 2 cases vs 3 . i purchased 1 first , then had second thoughts and went back and bought the additional 2 flavors ( creamy chocolate , cinnamon vanilla ( excellent flavor , by the way ) and irish cream ( a bit too subtle in flavor for me - could have a bit more oomph ) . as such , you'll see me refer to just 2 below . exterior shipping box was fine and interior 'case' holding product perfectly intact . however , contents ( 50 in each ) are a sticky , gooey , unusable mess . i purchased 2 flavors / 2 cases = 8 cartons = 400 of this product and all 8 cartons are a disgusting disappointment . while the majority of the single serve cups are fine , a large handful in every one of the 50 - pack boxes are squished , cracked or just ripped open . contents spilled over the rest of the single serve cups throughout the boxes that are now slimy , sticky and tacky , with what looks like dried and / or tacky curdled milk all over them . i had to throw away 46 cups total and wash every other single serve cup by hand and then find another container to hold them all . i sure won't be buying these again . 
=================
don't listen to the other reviews . here is all you need to know . i've read the reviews about it clogging the machine and grounds spilling all over and it's all moot as far as i'm concerned . i too placed my first cup in my cuisinart and had the grounds spill all over . i took out the k cup and found out that it did not puncture a complete hole in the bottom . the next cup i put in i closed a little more forcefully and it punctured a hole just fine . i've been enjoying pretty good coffee ever since . so my friends , just make sure a hole is punctured in the cup . you can even take it out and check and then put it back in . no problems with this k cup so stop worrying about it . 
=================
date stamped on product is mfg date , not expiration i ordered this product on may 2 , 2012 . it arrived as promised and the box had a date stamped on it of feb 14 , 2012 . it did not clarify whether this was the manufacture date or the expiration date . i called amazon and they found a note related to this product indicating that this is the manufacture date and that the product expires 9 months from manufacture . i suggested they update their product description with this information because it can be confusing otherwise . so , it basically leaves me with 6 months to use this product . i doubt i will through 200 packets by then , but it is still much more convenient than finding another container to put a small amount of ketchup for single serving use .

n o t . . . . . . l i k e . . . . . . m o m , . . . . ( o r . . . . i ) . . . . . . m a k e . . . . . . i t . . . . ! chicken soup has a great reputation . it is supposed to calm nerves , and cure anything from the common cold , to cancer . or so tradition would have one think . i dunno . . . . chicken soup never did me any harm , i guess - - but i can't remember it curing anything , either . though not my favourite soup , i never really disliked it . ok . . . . my mother makes a clear soup . soak the chicken , and vegetables , under a low light , in a covered pot , for hours . then , take the fat off with a ladel . remove the chicken and vegetables , and serve on a separate platter , ( so that just the right amount of chicken stock and vegetables go into each person's soup . . . or none at all , if desired . ) not bad ! my own way of making chicken soup is a little simpler . take chicken meat , ( breat , dark meat from the legs , whatever you wish ) , and cut into small pieces , ( the smaller , the better . ) place 1 / 2 milk , half - water mixture in blender , and slowly add chicken pieces , and mixed vegetables and spices if you wish . after a few minutes , you have a nicely pureed chicken soup . also not bad . however , campell's healthy request cream of chicken soup , which i bought to save refrigerator space , ( chicken parts have to be refrigerated , this soup does not ) - - doesn't taste good , ( or like either my mom's chicken soup , or my own ) . i suppose this is because " modified food starch " , ( the second ingredient in this campbell's soup ) , was never used by either my mother or myself in ourchicken soups . ( has anyone ever added modified food starch to their home - made chicken soups , i wonder ? ) . yes , there are tiny bits of chicken meat in this soup , ( fourth ingredient , after chicken stock , modeified food starch , and water ) . . . but very little of these . most ofthe ingredients come under the heading : less than 2 % of " , but i begin to wonder if the " chicken meat " contained in the first section of ingredients , ( those above 2 % ) , may be like only 3 % or so ! in the " 2 % or less " category are listed both " salt " and " sea salt " . . . . making for perhaps 4 % salt , in toto . this is supposed to be a " low - sodium " soup - - but is 410 mgs of salt , ( 17 % of daily value ) , actually a " low sodium " soup ? pehaps , compared to the regular campbell's soup , ( listed at 840 mgs on the label ) , it is . but no - one i ever knew puts even 410 mgs of salt into any home - made soup . a preservative ? yes . but still too much salt for my taste . vitamin e is also a preservative - - and a much healthier one at that . more expensive - - definiely yes . but it would make the soup far more palatable to have 1 / 2 the salt , ( 205 mgs ) , and then adding a little vitamin e ! all i know is that this abundance of salt adds not only somewhat of a danger to my heart , but also a slightly sour taste to this soup . making it taste , not only sour , but also so very , very unlike the chicken soup i either my mom or i make . perhaps the regular , non - healthy request chicken soup by campbell's is better . i'll get one or two cans from my local supermarket and see , before i buy 24 via amazon , ( which is what i should have done , before buying this " healthy request " campbell's soup . ) truly , i like their heathy request mushroom and celery soups , and don't find their healthy request tomato soup half - bad . but one can't judge every campbell's soup by the ones that one likes , it seems . this cicken soup is just too salty and too soury for me ever to buy it again . but it is palatable . . . just palatable . so , yes , i will force myself to finish all twenty - four 10 and 3 / 4 ounce cans . . . . maybe one every three days or so . chicken soup is , after all , supposed to be good for one . or so they say . i'm sure this isn't bad soup . i just wish it tasted better .

dogs liked them ok . despite the name , these are not really cupcakes . they're just flat cookies . the sprinkles fall off pretty easily , so be careful to clean up after yourself . on the plus side , our dogs liked them .

not as crunchy as the other blue diamond flavors i'm addicted to blue diamond almonds . i've tried all the flavors - - and this was the last one i tried . i love salt , i love vinegar , and i love salt - and - vinegar potato chips , so how could i lose with these ? well , i'm just not that into them . the flavor's great and the almonds are fresh , but somehow the texture just fails . the almonds just seem . . . soggy . they don't have that wonderful crunch that the other blue diamond flavors have . and that flattens out the whole experience of eating them . i've eaten about 10 bags so far , and they all have the same lackluster texture . oh well . guess even my ol' reliable blue diamond can't hit it out of the park every time .

bait and switch these used to be an excellent value but in sept / oct 2011 , seasons changed their can design ( which itself is a good thing because the old cans were difficult to open ) , but they put in less sardines and the sardines are now of an inferior quality . the old can had a printed net weight of 3 . 75 oz , and there were in fact about 3 . 8 oz of sardines in the can . . . 6 - 7 tender , moist yummy sardines . now , in the new cans ( which open from the corner ) , the actual weight of the sardines is about 3 oz . . . almost a 1 / 4 loss of product ( the printed weight is still 3 . 75 oz ) . . . and the price is still the same . what makes it worse is that the sardines are big ( 2 - 3 sardines vs the older 5 - 6 sardines , dry , tough and have an off smell . if you get a can which opens from the top , you're good to go , but if you have the newer can which opens from the corner , you're getting an inferior sardine and paying more for less . another example of an american company sacrificing quality for higher profits .

christmas gift i thought i was buying a coffee maker which would be very convient for my mother . i did not realize how hard it was for her to get the t disks . not everyone shops on line , especially at age 76 . she lives in another state , in a rural area and is just too hard for her to find these disks . also i have never been able to find maxwell house disks for her

oreo not just for splitting and fusing white cremey filling anymore now in peanut butter . ok . so i admit it . i submitted this package to an elite board of taste testing , not my own taste buds . i am far beyond the age of reason . the board gave her approval , and how ! oreo . not just melt in your mouth white filling anymore . not even the monster super - thick filling variation anymore . now , in peanut butter fudge . can you really keep your hands off of these ? get a bag , and see ! passed the board .

pop ices when i received this product i notice that the box was wet . when i opened the box , i found that ten ( 10 ) of the pop ices had leaked . there appears to be a good variety of flavors and since i only received them yesterday i have not tried any yet .

not as pictured strong alcoholic smell and taste that other brands do not havevery light colored shell ( not dark or brown like the picture ) comes in zip lock bag ( not vacuum sealed , no foil to protect against sunlight ) no expiration date ( no idea if it is fresh or has been on the shelf for years . . . ) 
=================
already opened , items missing i have ordered this exact item from amazon a few times before . it is basically two 12 packs in one box . one of the 12 packs was already opened and was missing four of the mini bottles . this is the first time i have had this happen . it's not worth sending back , but it's extremely annoying . i will say that the product is great otherwise . it's virtually identical to 5 hour energy , but it costs half as much . the berry flavor isn't great , but it's not terrible either . 
=================
peach nectarine : taste like alka seltzer i bought this item with such great expectations but i am disappointed in the taste . yes , it is true that it smells great , just like peaches , and it has no calories but when you taste this beverage , it reminds me of alka seltzer ( yes , the pop - pop fizz fizz medicine ) . i don't recommend this product . however , if you can get past the bitter taste you may like it , buy with caution . you may want to buy only one case , ( 24 ) cans , for about $ 12 . 00 on subscribe and save to make sure you like it . i have tasted the talking rain kiwi strawberry which is five calories a can but it tastes great ; the calories are probably because of the juice and splenda added but i don't mind the five calories per can to have a great tasting beverage !

blue buffalo canned dog food i was not impressed one bit with this stuff . if it was any thinner you could pour it out of the can . i tried chicken soup for the dog lovers soul and it was an instant success with my dogs . actually had to break it up with a spoon . also it is much cheeper than blue buffalo and the quality is right up there with all other designer dog foods . most importantly it's also made in usa .

bait and switch this is not kalamata olive oil . 1 . tin has picture of normal olives not kalamata2 . no where on the tin does it say " kalamata " 3 . tasted it and it does not taste anything like kalamata ive had before . 4 . the description on site says 100 % kalamata . sending it back . . . . . updatethe same day i wrote this review i was contacted by mr . alexander mallas , with superolive . com , the seller . 650 - 591 - 1010 . he explained that the product description was written by the martinis company , the manufacturer . the kalamata is the region in greece where the olives are grown , not necessarily kalamata olives . i never knew there was such a place . the seller plans on clarifing this in their description . mr . mallas did say he attended an olive oil convention in greece and found that the locals make their own kalamata olive oil for themselves and it is not readily available to the public . the quest will continue . . . . it was a pleasure discussing the many different grades and types of olive oil . i plan on reading the book , extra virginity : the sublime and scandale , by tom mueller , which he recommended . i heard the program on npr , with this review . the martinis oil i have he said i can keep , with an acidy level of . 8 ( whatever that means ) i would only use it to fry fish , or other foods . i am satisfied with the response , in fact mr . mallas is a colorfull man , and would look forward to another discussion after completing myeducation . olive on . . . .

not quite a training meal let me start by stating we love the plum organic training meals - they have been a wonderful tool for helping us to transition our son to solid foods . when we saw this we thought it would be a great way to get him to start eating chunkier oatmeal . however , this is just juice and cinnamon - no oatmeal chunks ! it literally poured out ! seriously , gerber stage 1 meals are thicker than this ! the flavor is great - i will give it that . hence i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 . we mixed it with my son's single grain oatmeal to thicken it up and it made a great meal - but a really expensive one . we recommend the other meals - but not this . hope they improve this . 
=================
gave it 2 stars for the ingredients only . . . i bought this product for my yorkie and was so disappointed . first of all , they completely stink . second , the sticks are so hard that you have to cut them for a smaller breed with a good quality steak knife ( i used my high end stainless henkles knives and it took some effort ) . my puppy ( 7 1 / 2 months ) has torn through extra durable nyla bones and is a very tough chewer , so i was looking for something he can " play with " and eat which wasn't synthetic . he didn't know what to do with it even though he seemed to like it as a toy for a minute or two . but , the smell was overwhelming to me . i will donate them to a local rescue . interestingly enough , i also bought him other get naked treats and he didn't care for them either . perhaps he just doesn't like this brand . he does love blue buffalo treats , welness puppy treats ( they also stink , but in a bearable / pate kind of way ! ) and sojo's too !

other review dishonest the other review ( entitled 'fruit and branch mangler ) is dishonest . the reviewer wrote negative things about all the fruit pickers except his . in fact he has written countless negative reviews of many different products . he is a dishonest marketer who is gaming amazon for purely selfish reasons . i don't know a thing about this fruit picker , but i feel an obligation to go to places where the reviewer has done his damage to warn people that the review he wrote can't possibly be true . 
=================
be aware i love the taste but in 30 minutes after i drink this flavor i have to run to the bathroom . major cramps and diarrhea . i thought it was a fluke or something i ate at first , but then thought about the sobi drink . after putting two and two together i decided to try this first thing in the morning . sure thing , just like clockwork .

quick but tastes really processed i would not recommend this product . the cheese product doesn't taste like cheese at all ( some processed cheese does have a cheesy taste ) and the brocolli bits taste weird . i shouldn't have been very surprised because what broccoli and cheese comes in a box ? but i thought maybe the seasoning and pasta would be tasty enough to pull it off . it was a quick meal to prepare so for those in a time crunch it may fit the bill since it all comes in one box . i don't think it offers a great alternative to just buying some broccoli in a steamer bag , pasta and a bag of shredded cheese to add to your chicken with a little seasoning . if you're in a pinch it may do but overall i would have to pass .

why previous incorrect reviews ? the complete list of ingredients and nutritional facts are completely available down to the last detail . either they have added them in the last 2 weeks or they were not noticed .

deceptively tasty corn products of all types give me migraines , so i'm always looking for soda that doesn't have high fructose corn syrup . it's difficult to find regular soft drinks that don't contain corn syrup . i decided to give the switch a try because it contains ordinary sugar . i liked the taste of the black cherry switch . it tasted more like fruit punch than black cherry though . this makes sense because cherries are at the bottom of the fruit ingredients list . apple juice comprises most of the fruit juice in black cherry switch . marketing this as " black cherry " is a bit misleading . they should call it carbonated " fruit drink " instead of " black cherry . " it annoys me when marketers employ deceptive advertising . that being said , i did enjoy the taste . i just recommend that people read the ingredients list before buying .

insanely fabulous tea ! i am insanely mad for this tea ! ( is that redundant ? ) it's not just the perfume of jasmine , but there's some mysterious astringency that happens on my tongue . with a dash of agave nectar for a hint of sweetness . . . i cannot get enough of this brew . 
=================
used to be excellent , formula changed this used to be my favorite tea , but the formula has changed . i've heard that if you can find the tea in the original pale yellow box , that it is still the old ( good tasting ) formula . read through the other negative reviews and comments for more info ( and notice the dates on the reviews , good and bad ) . it used to taste like a liquid fireball candy , now it tastes like hot water with black pepper . update aug 2012 : i purchased this tea from another source ( referenced in another amazon review for this product ) and although it did come in the newer purple packaging , the box says , 'with natural flavors , ' whereas the one i ordered from amazon says , 'with natural and artificial flavors . ' the one without the artificial flavors has the excellent taste you're looking for . 
=================
bizarre flavors on the plus side , this is a big , heavy plastic jar full of colorful jelly beans . on the negative side , so many of the flavors are " spit - em - out - quick " nasty . my wife and i thought only about a third were actually pleasant . a better idea would be to get a big jar full of just a few " normal " flavors . 
=================
just like car oil this is nasty stuff . when you compare to the great oils out there , this stuff is like using oil from your car . the best i have found to date , that also gives your popcorn that theater butter taste is from wabash valley farms real theatre popcorn popping oil . even my teenager can tell the difference . 
=================
pretty good this mix is pretty good , made with water . the texture can be strange if you add extras . . . if you add blueberries , don't make 12 large muffins , make about 16 small ones , or they will be gooey . and you need to cook them at 375 ( rather than 400 ) for approx . 10 minutes longer than it says . 
=================
good cinnamon for this price the product description is a little sparse , so when i came back to re - order and saw there were still no reviews , i thought i would add some more information . first , as you probably guessed from the price , this is cinnamon burmanii , so it is not the most flavorful variety of cinnamon , and it is not really suitable for grinding . the product come in 3 individual sealed packages with a reusable zip - top seal , which is nice , because you don't need a container to store it in once it is opened . the main thing i use them in is to flavor coffee instead of sugar , and they work pretty decently for that . for a normal , 6 - oz cup of coffee , you only need a half of a stick . they are pretty tough sticks though , i just switched to a 12 - oz mug and i use a whole stick . they have a good cinnamon flavor , being more sweet than spicy , so if you are looking for spicier cinnamon you may way to keep looking . i experimented with steeping the cinnamon in the coffee before pouring it in the cup , but it seemed a little bitter when i did that . you are better off putting it in right when you are ready to start drinking your hot beverage .

gave me tummy trouble for a couple of months my stomach had a " tight " feeling - like i couldn't relax it . i realized it started feeling that way around the same time i started drinking coco libre every day . i stopped drinking it and right away my stomach " relaxed " and it's been fine ever since .

scharffenberger milk chocolate with roasted cacao nibs when i ordered the chocolate i was unaware of the cacao nibs . the cacao nibs weregritty and detracted from the chocolate . the inclusion of cacao nibs was listed onthe chocolate bar in very fine print which i overlooked . i much preferred the samechoolate bar without the cacao nibs . 
=================
good but not as great as the smaller packs the larger bags of these are not as good as the smaller bags . even my 2 year old agrees . the pieces are smaller and there's not as much seasoning on them as the 3oz bags or whatever size the smaller ones are . it won't take long for us to eat these but we will buy the smaller sizes from now on . sad because these were a little less in cost . oh well .

bpa containing lids i wanted to make sure my baby has a good start just like all the parents out there . that is why i am buying organic food and i do my best to prepare fresh food for her when i can . i am so disappointed to know for a company labeling organic containing ''bpa '' in their lids . what is the point ? ? i spend considerable amount of money and effort to make sure my baby is not consuming toxins . i buy bpa free bottles , i even called similac feeding line to make sure formula containers did not have bpa - which they dont and i go buy a organic food with bpa lids . i am higly disapponted by earths best insensitivity to this matter . i personally feeled tricked . i trusted this company since i saw their food were in glass jars . i wanted to take this time to write this review . here is some facts about bpa - - - the chemical is bisphenol a , or bpa , a component of the plastic epoxy resins used to line metal food cans . dozens of laboratory studies show that bpa affects the developing brain and reproductive systems of animals exposed to low doses during pregnancy and early life . bpa has recently raised concerns from 2 separate expert panels of the national institutes of health ( nih ) , with 1 group of scientists warning that human exposures to bpa are already at or above the levels that harm animals and another expressing concern about impacts of bpa on infants' brains and behavior .

took my mt . biking energy upto another level i try to ride my mt bike every weekend . i usually eat a granola bar before riding to give myself some energy . i tried this shot and i felt better when climbng the hills . i'm not sure if it's placebo effect , but i honestly felt more energetic and less tired when climbing up the hills . i didn't experience any crash afterwards . i didn't mind the taste . i just expected the worst taste and took a shot , but the taste wasn't that bad . i wouldn't drink it for the taste , like i do with red bull , but not bad . anyways , if you need that extra ummppphhh in energy , this will do it for you .

not a pack of four i have not tasted this oatmeal yet but i do anticipate it to be very good . it did not come as a four pack though . it came as 4 separate cans that were not packed well at all . they were loose without any packaging material in the over sized box . all 4 cans came severely dented and look as though i purchased them from a bargain shelf . the $ 10 s + h fee seems a bit steep for this type of careless packing .

comparing velveeta pasta and cheese mixes there are two velveeta pasta and cheese dinners . this one , and kraft velveeta original shells & cheese , 12 oz . they both use packets of cheese sauce , not packets of powder . but sadly , this one's not that good . it's salty , and the tiny bits of broccoli are few and far between . and with all the sodium ( 1230 mg per serving compared to 940 mg for the regular shells and cheese ) , it's a long way from healthy . shells and cheese is better . it's pure , creamy comfort food that goes down smooth and leaves no aftertaste . the pasta's ridged - shell shape makes every bite taste good , as dribbles of cheese seep into each piece and stick to its sides . it's much better than the broccoli version . . . and way more yummy ( if more expensive ) than the regular kraft macaroni & cheese supermac & cheese pasta and sauce , 6 - ounce boxes ( pack of 24 ) .

very chewy this nori was very chewey and very low in flavour . will never buy this product again . good sushi sold at restaurants do not use this product . the nori makes or breaks the sushi and this destroyed it .

no more problems with pms i suffer from severe menstrual cramps that , at their worst leave me vomiting and doubled over in pain . the mood swings from the pms are another story . after reading so many glowing reviews about this tea , i decided to try it for myself . let me tell you , i feel like a normal person during my period for the first time in my life . drinking this tea along with taking hyland's menstrual cramp pills hyland's menstrual cramps tablets 100 ea have made my cramps so light that i only had to take one 200mg ibuprofen to take the pain completely away . i feel like i don't even have my period , which is something that never happens . this tea is a godsend !

why so high @ amazon ? granted , coffee is high . but at least every 8 weeks or so , this goes on sale for $ 5 . 99 or $ 6 . 99 per 33 - ounce jug at my local kroger . why is it so high on amazon ?

cat gained 7 pounds after 2 years diet on this food i started buying iams weight control and was keep buying it for 2 years . the purpose was to keep cat's weight under control . but he was hungry all the time and demanded more and more food . even though , i was giving him half less food portion that it was recommended on the package , he was keeping gaining weight . his weight was 12 pounds two years ago , now it is 19 pounds ! ! ! veterinarian told us that he is obese and should be on the diet to reach at least 15 lb . he should get only 270 kcal per day and no more . now i am giving my cat purina weight control . cat's behavior is completely different ! ! ! he is so much happier , and is not demanding food anymore . as a tip , add water to your cat dry food , it helps with prevention of urinary track problems . also , serving sizes should be smaller than it is recommenced on the packages . back to the iams weight control , i personally believe that they add some kind of appetite simulating substances into there food , and should be sued for this !

great product , but look for a better price elsewhere my 10 - month old loves these , but i found them at my local bj's warehouse for a better price . a pack of 3 bags for $ 7 . 49 . when we go out to run errands , i make a snack container for my little one , and mix a few things together for variety . whenever fussiness ensues , i take out the container and let him choose what he wants . he always chooses the yogurt melts and gerber crunchers ( look like baby cheese puffs ) . 
=================
too sweet ! it was good but too sweet easily mixes into anything . . . i added the recommended but it was not as tasty but then adding anymore makes it too sweet

overpriced water so the water is great and getting it delivered to your front door is even better . however , i didn't realize these were sold in the store for as little as $ 1 . 50 and here you're paying 2x the amount ! probably would have steered clear and purchased at the grocery store instead . lesson learned .

smells like bacon i bought this as a birthday gift for my brother . artificially flavored items normally smell or taste nothing like what it says , and though i'm not brave enough to actually taste this concoction , it actually smells just like bacon . nice work , torani .

liked old recipe better they don't taste good anymore since the recipe was changed . and i bought a bunch that i have to eat , anyway . will be looking for another low fat / hi protein crunchy snack . . . great customer service , though - so , nocomplaints there . thanks

cat food made with not - disgusting ingredients ! who knew ? the short version : my picky cats took to this immediately and it seems to have helped them with their digestive ( throwing up ) issues . the ingredients are much healthier than the standard " animal by - products " found in even the pricier pet food brands ( iams , pedigree , fancy feast , etc . ) . even though it's a little more expensive , i think it's worth it . this company also makes a similar product for dogs that is packaged in a similar - looking bag , so make sure you get the correct stuff . now for the longer version . . . pro : ( 1 ) healthier for the cats ! no scary bits - and - pieces - by - products ingredients ! many pet food brands - many " premium " pet - food brands have the exact same disgusting ingredients as el cheapo store brands , but charge you three times the price and give you the false idea that you're feeding your pets well . ( 2 ) small pieces - - my cats don't seem to like the bigger kibble sizes . the dog food version of this has much larger pieces with little peas / carrots mixed in . ( 3 ) nice packaging - - i like these plastic bags much more than the standard paper bags ( that often tear ) and the cardboard boxes ( that are easily dumped by the cats ) . plus , if the water dish gets knocked over , it won't soak through the bag and make the food soggy and gross . ( 4 ) did i mention healthier for the pets ? seriously , everyone should find out what's in standard pet food , because it's completely disgusting and in no way safe or healthy for pets . while i won't be eating my pets' food any time soon , at least with halo i know that ( technically ) i probably could . and if i had little kids running around , i'd rather have a brand of pet food like this around in case curious kids decide to taste it . con : ( 1 ) harder to find - - i have been purchasing this from my local organic store . i have not seen it carried at any other grocery / drugstore and i live in a fairly large metropolitan area . it may be carried at a petco / other pet chain , but the last time i went into a big pet box store , there were no healthy cat foods . everything had byproducts and gross stuff . so i haven't been back to one of those to check for halo . since petco apparently carries it online now , they are probably carrying it in the stores as well . but it doesn't seem to be any cheaper there than at my organic store , so i'll stick to the local store . speaking of price . . . ( 2 ) cost - - it's not a ridiculous price and is certainly worth it when you compare ingredients , but it's hard to get other family / friends to buy good stuff for their own pets when they can pick up el cheapo pet food for a buck or two . i'm trying to find it online for a little cheaper , but so far ( once s + h is factored ) , haven't found it yet . i'd also like to buy it in bulk , but haven't found that yet either . minor annoyance : the bag design - halo carries wet and dry food for cats and dogs . they also seem to carry the same flavor for each animal - for instance , there is wild salmon cat food and wild salmon dog food . now , the first time i buy a new food brand for the cats , i do exactly what i do for myself : i turn the package over and read the description and all the ingredients before buying . when i go to buy more , i don't usually read it . so i just grabbed the pink bag that said halo and spot's stew - wild salmon . when i dumped some of the food into my cats' bowl , the kibbles were about twice the size and also had little peas and carrots in it . i thought that was weird , but assumed they had changed the packaging . then when i put the bag back into the cabinet , i noticed something - in the picture on the front of the bag , the woman was holding a dog . not a cat . and of course , then i read it , saw that it saw dog food , and felt kind of silly . but you know , pink bag , watercolor - like picture of woman with an animal , had the correct flavor and brand . . . anyway , the cats were not really that interested in the dog food , but they ate about a bowl or so and also had wet food until i could get back to the organic store for cat food . luckily , i had someone to give the dog food to so it didn't go to waste . if you're buying this , make sure it says cat food . the bags are similar and if you're in a hurry and not paying attention , you might end up with the wrong stuff . apparently ellen degeneres is a co - owner of this company , which is cool , i guess , so if you need a celebrity thumbs - up before you buy anything , you've got at least one !

poor taste , poor mixing we have now gone through 4 formulas , and here are our conclusions . similac ( non - organic ) : they use cows which have been given growth hormones . seriously , even most non - organic milks in grocery stores do not use growth hormones . our baby spent his first four months off the growth - charts until it finally dawned on me to check into this . similac organic : our baby liked this one , but then a nyt article revealed that this formula has a significant amount of cane sugar added - no wonder he liked it . earth's best : we really struggled with the transition from similac to earth's best . we went through a 2 week transition of 3 / 4 similac , 1 / 4 earth's best . . . with a slow increase in the earth's best . even to our adult taste senses , it had a fishy odor and taste ( likely the dha , which is supposedly taken from seaweed for this brand ) . and it never went into solution . we would constantly have to interrupt his feeds to check and see whether the nipple was clogged - being a baby , he would suck and suck - - even when no milk was coming out . our baby developed eczema - i am not convinced the formula caused the problem . babies get eczema . but after trying everything else ( detergents , lotions , soaps , etc ) and reading some reviews questioning whether earth's best caused eczema , we decided to try one more formula switch . baby's only organic : " now here is something i can add to my coffee when we run out of milk , " says my husband . it has a wonderful smell of oatmeal . no transition needed , our baby finished an entire 8oz in one sitting . it goes into solution better than both the similac and the earth's best . no gi distress or constipation when we made the switch . i agree with other reviewers that it is annoying that the canisters are small , but scoop for scoop , it is less expensive than earth's best . just waiting for amazon to have a " subscription " discount . i highly recommend baby's only ! 
=================
hard to tell if it is working although it is hard to judge this product with only trying it once , i cannot give any real proof that it does give one energy or the immune system . the taste is tart ; although it isn't not bad , it isn't exactly the taste one would seek for a refreshment . if you drink it down quickly it makes it taste a little better . considering the price of this product , i probably would not buy it . it is pricy for a product that is hard to tell if it is working . 
=================
genius concept ! absolutely genius concept . 0 footprint , not like those bulky formula holders ! the only thing is they are really over priced here . they're much cheaper purchased at your local store .

sadly this product doesn't live up to its name at all . . . i was quite happy to give this eboost acai pomegranate product a try - after all , i love pomegranates and really like acai . . . i couldn't taste either of those flavors in this drink . i added a pouch to 8 fluid ounces of water - it immediately begin to fizz and ended up making a tiny bit of a pink mess ( this powder foams like crazy when added to water ) : strike one . then i gave it a bit of time to settle before giving it a try : wow , i was very taken aback . the flavor is very mineral - y , both from first taste all the way thru to after - taste , where it gets even worse , way worse : strike two . i took a look at the package quite a bit closer then , to see if all this was worth it , at least hoping to find some type of super - positive health boost worth all the foaming , and mineral ( yucky ) flavor : there wasn't anything . strike three . i agree that these minerals and vitamins are good & necessary , but i wouldn't use this particular method to get them : there are much better products on the market to take in things this powder touts like zinc . and that's that . . . and to end , the product is pink . very pink . now , i like pink , but i was taken aback by this : my main complaint is this doesn't taste like acai or pomegranante at all , so it just doesn't live up to its name .

out of stock i tried this decaf and found it to be an pretty good . thought i would give it a second try but when i went to order more it was out of stock . i called jeremiah's pick directly to find out about that . a rude detached phone sales person responded with a flat voiced response : " it's out of stock " . i asked how long she thought it would be before they roasted more and had it back in stock and she said : " it's out of stock " . so i was curious and asked her if it would ever be back in stock and she said : " it's out of stock " . i asked one final question in hopes of finding out whether i would ever be able to get it again . i asked why they were out of stock . was it a bean shortage , a roasting delay - please give me any insight you could about the future prospect of being able to buy this product . the response ? a flat , no energy " it's out of stock " . what poor customer relations . i will never try to order this coffee again . customer service is important . i switched over to backcountry " no trace " organic , water processed fair trade decaf and this was a wonderful surprise . i was in luck . backcountry is now my top of the list , great flavor and aroma and their service is friendly and they ship the same day they roast . love backcountry coffee . hey jeremiah's pick . . . . " you're out of a customer ! " .

tasty but won't eat unless they change the coloring this is my favorite candy but i found out they use cochineal for the pink coloring . cochineal are beetles scraped from cacti , dried and crushed . i don't eat food with bugs in it . it's a shame they don't change it because these are so delicious .

if you like small peanuts , this is your brand quality of the peanuts are okay ( on a quality rating scale of okay , good and fine ) but the size of the peanuts are the smallest i have found in my local grocery chains . i only buy this brand when i am desperate . . . so if you are desperate , buy away or if you are a fan of small , okay peanuts then look no more , you have found your peanut utopia . otherwise , keep on looking . . . .

excellent flour ! i've purchased this flour from amazon in order to make pita bread . it's wonderful ! atta flour is ground finer than other whole wheat flours and so gives excellent results . i also use it to make no - knead bread , and the loaves are turning out lovely . also , i've successfully substituted it for unbleached all - purpose flour in pancakes , and muffins with excellent results . only difference is that the batter seems to see rise and bubble up when it sits but i just stir back together to smooth it before pouring / scooping into trays , and it bakes and rises beautifully . i'm still experimenting with it and will try it with cakes next . highly recommended ! update : i noticed a little later that the flour was sent to me past its " better if used by " date of december 27 , 2009 . my item was shipped to me on january 30 , 2010 . amazon's customer service was wonderful , and i received a prompt full refund from them since they couldn't guarantee that an immediate replacement from the seller would not have the same problem . unfortunately , i could not change my positive review of the seller ( india connect ) to outline the problem and express my displeasure at being sent a food item past it's " better if used by " date . of course i realize that flour does not immediately expire , and thankfully i had it stored in the fridge . so , even though we used it when we first got it with no ill effect , it is a matter of principal that i was sold twenty pounds of flour past its " better if used by " date . that's just wrong . so i wanted to give fair warning to anyone who might want to order this item ( sujata chakki atta flour , 320 - ounce bag , from india connect ) . thanks amazon for taking care of this .

careful ! read the back of can . . . . . . . i did agree with these two reviews . excellent refrieds ; the best by far ! then one day i bought a can at savemart and the back of the can said arizona where it ususlly said a product of mexico ! ! sure enough , not very good now ! check it out . i am not sure if these will be replacing the mexico beans ? ? but this is all i can find now - arizona ! ! blaach ! ! !

love the tin , hate the taste . i'm adventurous when trying new foods and the fun , graphic tin definitely gave me the extra push to try these organic ginger mints . well , lets just say they're not going on my 'most awesome foods ever ! ' list . i'm not a huge fan of ginger , but figured i'd give these a try anyway . they're not a 'smooth' candy like some mints are ( slightly gritty ) and have a sharp ginger 'bite' towards the middle - end that lingers for long after its dissolved . they're so potent , i tasted it for a good hour after just one had been finished . i gave it to family members who don't mind the taste of ginger and they too were disappointed in how they tasted . while i'm not going back to these , the other flavors do interest me . points though , for the hinged , reusable tin ( i'm thinking they'd be great for the lush cosmetics line of soap chunks and solid shampoo slices that are sold by the pound and dissolve in the shower if they're not dried , tinned and moved out of the bathing area . also great for use when traveling with the soaps / shampoos and cheaper than buying one of their branded tins ) . made in mexico , mine contained about 40 , beige - colored mints .

not bad ! with all the hoopla , i decided to give this a try , without any great expectations . i was expecting this to be very bland , but surprisingly it wasn't . i thought it was pretty medium in taste and not bad at all .

great trap i have two dogs in my back yard and i can never seam to keep the flies off of them . this year was really bad , before i got this trap they had 3 types of fly repellent on them and they still were getting over ran by flies . i got this trap because the only bad review was about the small and i was willing to try anything that was only around $ 6 . i have to say that i love this trap when i first mixed the trap the water was green and for the first day and only got 1 or 2 flies , but after that the water turned yellow and then the flood gates opened . by the end of day 2 there were at least 100 and within about 3 maybe 4 days there were so many flies that they went able to get to the poison but still were stuck in the cup . after that the fly around my house were gone for about a week but are starting to come back . i will be getting many more of the victor fly traps for the rest of this year and all of next .

horseradish peas when i first got my order and open the can so i can eat some , i realized these peas aren't even that hot and didn't even taste like wasabi . a quick look at the ingredients label confirmed my suspicions when i saw the ingredient horseradish labeled on it . unfortunately for me i bought 4 cans .

7 oz mixed fruit pkg with peaches i picked up two packs at my market based on sunmaid and mixed fruit with peaches . of the two packs , one had a peach slice . zero in the other . one was full of theplums . but are they plums or prunes ? and overall , they are just stickey . my wifeloves dried fruit , so she got them in the work lunch first . she returned the bag and requested " no more of those " . accordingly , i threw out both packs . i called sunmaid to comment 559 896 8000 . and got a recording . called back in the pm to ask if the consumer relations dept was working . the secretary said they are overwhelmedwith complaints and it may take one to two days to get call . this is the end of the second day without a call . now , i don't care . and , since i am thinking about sunmaid , why did they make the raisen boxes smaller but keep the price the same . . . hmmmmm $ $ marshallgulch

worthington vegetarian whoever worthington vegetarian uses to ship is a very poor shipper ! over half ( 6 ) of the cans of burger i received were dented . iam too nervous to use them . what i have used is not the best vegiproduct i have tasted . the texture is pretty close to real meat butwe really do not like the flavor . i have to over season it with a lot ofheat spices or mix it with real meat for my son to even nibble at it . the entire reason i paid soooo much $ 44 . 00 for it was to help convert my son away from real burger . forget that ! he'll never trust me again . so i will never trust worthington again .

bake your own . . . don't pay this much ! ! ! these cookies are delicious but most assuredly not worth $ 8 . 99 . shame on amazon for charging this much ! ! ! ! amazing that amazon has the audacity to charge this much . i have bought these cookies at whole foods for $ 4 . 99 and at natural grocers / vitamin cottage for $ 4 . 69 . i thought these prices were too much . . . i was shocked when i saw them priced even higher on amazon . grace's has their own website but they charge more than whole foods . since when did we have to dole out this much money to get a good cookie ? ? ? my mother used to make cookies this good - now i just need to find the right recipe to replace the need to purchase these too expensive cookies . i would rather do without and send the money to some needy family . seems that amazon would rather rip off the consumer and keep the extra for themselves .

c'mon , people . get real , other reviewers ! this coffee right here is obviously at least twice as good as what you can get directly from nespresso on its website . nespresso is clearly fobbing off inferior product - - probably coffee beans made in china , or maybe even taiwan ! ninety - nine ninety - nine here at amazon , or fifty - seven at nespresso - your choice . just remember : you get what you pay for . . . right ?

why not promote crystal light pure ? ? ? to help me drink more water i used flavor crystals to make it more palatable . when i visited my doctor i was told i had high blood pressure . i asked why for 66 years my blood pressure was normal but now it was high and i needed 2 prescriptions . doctor said that was normal . since i like to research i found that the crystals i was using had aspartame , one of the most dangerous artificial sweeteners . side effects include headaches , anxiety , abdominal pain , nausea , heart palpitations , irritable bowel syndrome & high blood pressure . acesulfame potassium is another artificial sweetener used in some crystal light varieties . this sweetener contains methylene chloride , which is a known carcinogen - long - term use of this carcinogen may cause cancer . other side effects include nausea , headaches and impaired liver . i stopped using anything with aspartame ( threw out the prescriptions ) and my blood pressure is now normal . the " natural " crystal light is not really natural because it contains aspartame ( which i was told is also genetically modified ) . crystal light has a very good product called " natural " . it uses cane sugar ( not gm sugar beet ) & truvia . this is a much better product and only a few calories more than the " natural " which is not really natural . aspartame is not natural . many other synthetically sweetened products use aspartame . you have to read all labels . it's better to eat smaller amounts of real food rather then more synthetically sweetened , gm frankenfood and avoid the side effects . what's the big deal in a few extra natural calories ?

not at all what i thought so amazon suggested this as an alternative to crawford garibaldi biscuits . being how i am in search of a suitable replacement for the old sunshine raisin biscuits , i figured i'd give 'em a try . what a mistake . not only they are nothing like the sunshines , they are nothing like the garibaldis either . the pictures on the package are quite misleading , suggesting that there is actual fruit to be found inside the biscuits . not so . yeah , there's a couple of raisin specks in each biscuit , but if you didn't already know that you'd be hard - pressed to figure out what kind of fruit it was supposed to represent . on the upside ? well , the dog likes them . so i won't bother to return them as she is a good dog and deserving of things that she thinks are a treat . you probably won't find them very treat - like unless you long for dried out wafers with vaguely representational fruit - specks in them . get the garibaldis instead . crawfords garibaldi biscuits 100g ( case of 12 )

make sure you really like cocoa before you buy this the all - natural ingredients make for very pleasant reading - with dried cane syrup ; rice , wheat , corn flour ; and sesame seeds combining to provide a delivery vehicle for the anti - oxidants contained in cocoa . unfortunately for me , the taste of cocoa was so strong , that it overpowered everything else - i could barely detect traces of cinnamon or the other ingredients . while i was very pleased with the fact that there is practically no chemical aftertaste , i don't see myself becoming a fan of this product . happy snacking ! ~ damodar

not what i expected i buy a lot of if you care brand products & was very pleased to see they make environmentally friendly gloves . i ordered them through the subscribe & save program thinking i wouldn't worry about household gloves again ! i am so disappointed in these . i am canceling the subscription with amazon . the cotton flock lining is a joke . i certainly cannot feel it . the rubber is stiff & the fit is poor . i ordered the size small & have to keep tugging them up because they are too long in the fingers . they move down a bit making matters worse . for some reason the pinkie finger in particular is way too long ; more so than the extra length in the other fingers . my hands start to sweat in these pretty darn fast . when i need to take them off , they don't come off easy despite the fact that they are too long / big . i have to practically peel them off . they are not comfortable . the only thing to like about them besides being environmentally friendly is that they are a pretty cheerful green color . i am going back to my old gloves by casabella . i have yet to find a better pair of household gloves . they fit well , last long & are very comfortable . they also have more meat to them for protection when you are using really hot or cold water . don't try using the if you care with scalding hot water ! amazon sells casabella & casabella is what i recommend .

not as handsome , but filled with just as much flavor ! these belly flop jelly belly jelly beans are in odd shapes , some are stuck together and they are not as perfectly formed as the regular ones are , but they taste exactly the same and once they are in your mouth , you never know just what they looked like , and they are half the price . my husband says " order more " ! !

wow , that dust travels pros : * very , very cheap * may be healthier than clay - based * not a bad odorcons : * clumps are very difficult to remove from the sides and bottom of box * i found white dust everywhere within 5 feet of the box , including on top of the refrigerator , and on pots and pans above the refrigeratori started using this to get away from the possibly harmful clay dust . i was pleased with how cheap it is . that helped me overlook the fact that it was a workout to get the clumps out . but after a year of use , i could no longer overlook the extremely fine white dust that was accumulating on my peanut butter jars on top of the refrigerator . i am now using world's best , which is more expensive , but worrth it . buy it from amazon or petfooddirect .

love it ! and mold shouldn't be a problem . . . just received my beaba today and made two purees for baby . it's convenient , easy to use - - makes making baby food a breeze . before i was steaming in the microwave , which kills some of the nutrients , not to mention that the plastic i was using may or may not have bpa . with the beaba i don't need to worry about this anymore ! i just take whatever we're cooking for ourselves , pop it into the beaba and by the time our dinner is ready , so is baby's ! i was a little hesitant to purchase this because i read some of the reviews about mold - - and it's difficult to know what the reviewers are referring to exactly without having the product in front of you . now that i've used the beaba , i'm wondering if the people who complained of mold were following the directions . i can see how mold could form in the water reservoir if you don't empty it after use . obviously , mold can form any where there is water pooling for extended periods . however , the instructions clearly state to empty any water from the reservoir after each use , which i did immediately after using . i also left the top off just to ensure that any additional drops left inside would dry up . if you take this precaution , i don't see any way possible for mold to have the opportunity to form . when the instruction booklet talks about descaling the reservoir using vinegar , it's to ensure there is no lime build up - - not mold . after having used the beaba , i don't think anyone interested in purchasing this should be turned off by claims of mold . if you take care of the machine properly , it won't be a problem .

failed on delivery , awesome on customer service i ordered the french vanilla , the only creamer i ever like . unfortunately , before my item was shipped , amazon put the item under review and sent me hazelnut . yuck ! i was refunded the money , thankfully , but was told that i could reorder after the item was no longer being reviewed . as i spoke to the amazon representative , i checked the item and saw that the price had increased . amazon customer service took care of me and i was completely satisfied by the time i got off the phone . i got a refund for the item and i'll be getting a replacement item once it becomes available . thank you amazon . although this means i'll be stuck w / more powered creamer or starbucks until my creamer comes in .

this one was a miss ! i like the convenience and quality of the k - cups and thought the hot chocolate would be as good as the coffee and tea . the problem is the chocolate is a fine powder so it remains in the container instead of dissolving and flowing into the mug . it is better to run a mug of hot water from your keurig and then stir in your favorite packet of hot chocolate mix . 
=================
not for me . . . i just despise this product but everyone i know loves it . i think the texture of the lowfat and the regular is just weird .

beware kingdom chicken jerky treats . . . . . . . . my dog and cat love them . i thought this was made in usa when i went to the web site . i just read the news article about chicken jerky treats made in china causing animal deaths . im stuck with this since i dont want to hurt my animals .

buyer beware ! highly addicting ! i absolutely love justin's nut butter maple almond ! it is so good i eat it out of the jar ( like an earlier reviewer stated ) . but don't take my word for it . . . it's justin's favorite too ! ! ! as an fyi , it is not as smooth as peanut butter . there is an almost grainy consistency . this does not deter from it's flavor and it is still easy to spread .

newmans own canned cat food 3 out of my 4 cats will not touch this . pretty pricey for alot of gravy & grain & little meat .

not as good as the prepared stuff this is good , but not as tasty as the stuff you buy in the stores already prepared . it does have a slight aftertaste , and since i'm more calorie - conscious than worried about suger ( not diabetic ) , i went back to the regular pudding ; tastes 10 times better and more chocolaty ! : )

leave this one on the shelf it works reasonably well with condenser microphones . with dynamics the hum exceeds the signal . works with windows , not with linux . the build is very cheap . anything more than $ 5 for this is too much .

 " pop " star ! ! i have spent lots of cash on white popcorn . tried most of the fancy ones . i ran out of all of it one friday night and was forced to 'lower my popcorn standards " and buy some orville . i made faces as i popped it with olive oil ( try it . extra flavor ) on top of the stove because it was going to disappoint . i always make a huge pan so i can eat it for a couple days . all but 3 kernels popped ! amazing ! out of that huge pan i found 2 partial hulls . it tasted delicious , had just enough crunch but still melted in my mouth . if orville was around , i'd stalk him ! ! ! with all the money i will save , not giving it to the amish , i'm gonna stock up ! btw , imo , air poppers should be illegal ! 
=================
medifast safe and great tasting i was shocked at how great this stuff tastes and what shocked me even more was how great all of the walden farms products taste . when i first started medifast i ate everything sweet and after just a few days of being on medifast i learned how great all of their stuff tastes . i was shocked that food this good was so healthy . i have tried all of the salad dressings and have liked them all . walden farms creamy bacon salad dressing packets - six 1 oz . packets per boxwalden farms honey dijon dressing , sugar free , calorie free , fat free , carb free , gluten freesalad dressing ranch 12 fl . oz

vitamin c plus caffeine , but weird taste this adds vitamin c and caffeine to your water , which is great for people who are looking for that . caffeine may boost your workouts , and is the daily drug of choice for many of us , but watch out for side effects and don't over do it . the deal breaker for me on this one was taste . it tastes sort of like sweet fruit punch kool - aid , with a pronounced aftertaste . i strongly prefer optimum nutrition essential amino energy , fruit fusion , a powdered caffeine add - on , or some of the mio products . 
=================
no issues here i don't normally write reviews , but felt compelled to give another viewpoint based on the poor reviews of these bottles . i exclusively pump and measure my milk accurately . i have had absolutely no inaccuracies in measurement between my breast milk containers and these bottles ( and my breast milk collection bags ) , so i'd have to conclude that the measurement on the bottles is accurate . in addition , i've had absolutely no leaking ( with the exception of once when the nipple was not placed in the cap correctly ) and none have broken . i have 7 bottles in rotation that have been used for over 3 months , and again , no breakage . i would have to question how some of the bottles that have broken are cared for ? they really should not be placed in the dishwasher . . . . especially not on a heated dry cycle . i hand wash my bottles with a bottle brush and hot soapy water , then steam sterilize once a day . we are extremely happy with this product .

bull's - eye hickory bbq sauce is my favorite , and no hfcs ! i like their hickory & original , but find the rest were too bland for me ! their guinness sounds good , but i won't pay the super inflated online prices . btw - i can buy all but guinness at wally world . . . , for much less ( no s & h either ) ! 
=================
product great , but container very wasteful i just opened the canister . it was seriously 1 / 3 full . what a waste of space . i like the product , though . but i may have to look for something else . i have purchased greens for myself from a variety of companies over the years . i have never seen anything like this . 
=================
tastes good , but . . . . it tastes good and may be good for hydration but 29 grams of sugar . . . come on , you gotta do better than that to be considered healthy . .

barilla mezze penne with spicy marinara sauce let me start by saying i love barilla sauces . it's the only sauce i buy in the jar to use and their marinara in the jar is the best base i've ever used . this however was terrible . i was completely disappointed . i heated it as per instructions but needed to heat it another 45 seconds after mixing it up in a microwaveable bowl because it was only just warm . it is not very spicy at all and i could mainly only taste tomatoes . the pasta had a very strange taste to it , not sure how to describe it but i had to make myself finish it . i wanted to throw it out but i'm not a wasteful person so i ate it . there is well under 2 cups total to eat so if you were giving it to a very young child it may be enough but i had to go make my lunch after eating it as i felt like i had nothing to eat and , no , i am not a big eater . usually just a sandwich is more than enough for me for a meal . i would not buy this in a store for any price . i feel like i even wasted my electricity by heating it . glad i got this from vine so it was free or i'd really be mad as this is expensive for what little you get even if it had been good and i'm glad i have already used barilla products because if this had been my first taste of theirs i would never use anything of theirs . 
=================
weak , but tasty ! this product met my expectations very well . the flavor wasn't quite what i expected , however . i expected a cinnamon flavor with subtle hints of hazelnut and vanilla . instead , i found that all three flavors are pretty evenly distributed . the end result is a cacophony of flavors which is very powerful and distracts from the natural coffee flavor . the beans themselves are rather small . because of this , i think , the coffee is rather weak . i find myself having to use 30 % more coffee per pot than with my traditional coffee beans . the cup , when poured black , has a very weak color to it , if you add creamer the look is very reminiscent of tea with milk . when i first tried the coffee i was very unhappy with the results . however , after tweaking the amount of grounds i use ( as well as increasing the coarseness of my grounds ) i found a product that was palatable . would i buy it again ? probably not . however , i can see many people who dislike strong coffee truly enjoying this . 
=================
be careful here these have a good smell and a not so great flavor , at first . they are oddly addictive . i am use to maltitol and its effects on the digestive track . these i must say , caught me a bit off guard . my 16 year old daughter ate almost a pack and she was ill for 2 days . ( im sure she wont appreciate me sharing this ) she had severe stomach cramps and unstoppable diarrhea . i did not have any terribly bad symptoms . but i did have a bit of bloating . my other concern with this product is that the net carbs in one serving ( 6 pieces ) is 11 grams . that is extremely high especially if you are diabetic or following a low - carb diet . reference point : 1 / 2 of a hershey bar is 10 . 5 net carbs . i think i would prefer the hershey bar . 
=================
check product date when you get it this is a very good cereal ( hence the five - star rating ) , but twice i received boxes from amazon either too close to or past the " best by " date stamped on the top flap . when i received a pack of six boxes three weeks past the " best by " date , i complained to amazon . a rep quickly responded with an e - mailed apology and said amazon would credit my credit card for the purchase price . ( foodstuffs cannot be returned for health reasons , of course . ) i realize the " best by " date is not an expiration , but it takes me weeks to consume 6 boxes of cereal , so i want the freshest product possible .

good value , well packed the assortment is a large box - - - the individual 8oz bags are much larger than they look in the photo . with the bonus bag , the assortment comes out to 5 1 / 2 pds of coffee for $ 40 ( subscription price at the time of this writing ) , which works out to a an economical $ 7 . 27 per pound - - and that doesn't even count the mugs . the mugs are well - designed , light and fit nicely in the hand . yeh , i know they are just mugs , but i have dozens of mugs , many of which are unnecessarily heavy and / or hard to hold . but these are above average , in a functional sense . although the bags look like kraft paper , in fact they are metalized - plastic inside , sealed air - tight , and re - seal air - tight easily and securely . they even have a valve so you can squeeze out excess air , which is a good thing to do . the presentation box is utilitarian but nice - - - the sampler would make an excellent gift for any coffee lover , even a wedding gift . the selection is sumatra mandheling , costa rican tarrazu , columbian supremo , breakfast blend , french roast , dark house blend , italian dark roast expresso , french vanilla , hazel nut , and decaf columbian . unfortunately , not the selection i would make if i had a choice . the full 8 - oz " free sampler " was city roast colombian , but presumably other varieties may be substituted for the " free sample " . honestly , i'd prefer another bag of coffee rather than the mugs , and i wish i could have the option of a " no - decafinated no - flavored " sampler . but , the french vanilla and hazelnut are not too objectionable , and one can always save the single decaf bag for evenings . ironically , you can purchase an all decafinated sampler coffee bean direct assorted whole bean decaf coffee sampler , 9 - pound box , or an all flavored sampler coffee bean direct assorted flavored whole bean coffee sampler , 9 - pound box , so why can't they offer a " no - decafinated no - flavored " sampler ? if you are a real coffee lover , i strongly suggest purchasing a mellita manual cone system , such as melitta cone filter manual coffeemaker 6 cup , 1 - count for some reason i cannot link to the " 10 cup " system , which i recommend . i'm working my way slowly though the coffees . i'll add updates as i go through them . note that such evaluations are strictly a matter of personal tastes , and quality may differ between batches . in general i prefer light roasts , and loath flavored coffee . based on c being " typical american coffee " : sumatra mandheling c + glad i didn't buy the 5pd bag i was consideringdark house blend bcosta rican tarrazu bbreakfast blend bcity roast columbian afrench roast b + columbian supremo b + be careful grinding the french roast - - - it has alot of sugar as a glaze ( not enough to taste ) . if you overgrind the coffee you apparently melt the sugar , and the powdered coffee and sugar sticks , like a turd , in your grinder . i use a wooden popsickle stick to scrape it out , but still it's annoying . i do not know why sugar is added to dark roasts during the roasting process , but it is common . 
=================
not the favorite , but passable of all the gormet fancy feast varieties , this one seems to be the least favorite . not sure why - they won't eat salmon fresh from the market either . must not be on the regular cat's palate for some reason . the smell is quite nice though - smells like people food really . you can't really go wrong with these fancy feast varieties - they're the hit in this house ! 
=================
taste's good i am an avid tea drinker ; drinking at least one cup a day . i was excited to try this product because of the passion fruit and aloe vera additions . i also appreciate the fact that i don't have to brew it , i can just remove from the refrigerator and enjoy . i liked the flavor of the drink . i even liked the aloe vera pulp , the consistency did not bother me , but i can see how it could be a deal - breaker for some . the tea - flavor was very light , as it is green tea ; if i did not know tea was the third ingredient , i never would have guessed . with cane sugar as the second ingredient , i could definitely taste that flavor and it left an after - taste in my mouth . i think the price is a little high for this product , when i can home - brew regular tea for pennies . while this does have the added health benefits , i can see buying occasionally , but not as a daily or even weekly drink . i did not like that it is packaged in a plastic bottle , i did not factor that into my rating , but usually i do not buy any drinks that come in plastic bottles . 
=================
wow ! couldn't believe pricing on this ! dh has tassimo & loves cappuccino but he recently switched to the latte's as pricing in local stores ( one with a t ) began rising after the recall . you can get the latte locally at that red dot store for $ 8 . pricing is almost comical . 
=================
don't listen to the negative reviews ! i don't understand why other reviewers are complaining about the sugar content in this product . go to the website and see for yourself . this product has 1 gram of sugar per serving ! i don't understand how people think this stuff is " too sweet " . all i know is it sticks to the roof of your mouth like no other peanut butter ! 
=================
overpriced i love this coffee and was disappointed when they discontinued it for the tassimo brewers . i have since bought a keurig brewer , and was pleased to see the verona k - cups in costco yesterday for about $ 32 for this same 54 unit quantity . the price here is absurd . . . at this time . i'll wait until i see it on amazon in the $ 30 - $ 32 dollar range before ordering on amazon .

i wish i could do no stars . . . except for nick cage so there i was , splattering pond scum all around my yard . my knees and lower legs speckled in the fine flecks of pond excrement ( they got trapped in my legs hairs ) . in these moments , i think about life . i think , " do you understand life ? ! " the answer is no . sruprise ! ! ! the moral of the story is that this works great for ponds . don't drink it . ~ praise it ~

miss ted wouldn't touch it ! we have a 5 year old mixed breed dog who weighs about 85 pounds on good days . frankly , she has had a rough time of it . she caught the very tail end of the dog food crisis , ended up with kidney problems that rear their ugly heads now and then , and has become the world's pickiest dog food eater . chances are good that if she will eat any given dog food , it is a 50 - 50 proposition as to whether or not her kidneys will act up . as a result , miss ted's people have tried any number of dog foods - the cheap stuff , the expensive stuff , the special diet stuff , the stuff from walmart , the stuff from the grocery store , the stuff from the pet store , the stuff from the vet , even the refrigerated stuff , so i was happy to be given a chance to try purina beneful original dog food , 15 . 5 - pound . the bag arrived beautifully packaged and unlike his normal habit of simply leaving things on the porch , the ups driver carried this all the way upstairs for me . ( i was very grateful . ) miss ted happened to be in one of her " that stuff is poison and i'm not going to touch it so i'll just eat the cat's food until i can get into the pantry for some real people food " mood , so her bowl remained untouched . we tried another half - dozen times over a period of 10 days or so and got the same reaction every time . the dog food looks fine and smells fine , but miss ted won't eat beneful - even if she hasn't eaten anything but the cat food in a couple of days . others have pointed out some of the controversy surrounding this particular dog food , as well as the low rating given to the product by the dog food advisor due to the high fat and carbohydrate levels . grandma's $ 0 . 02 : if you are feeding strays like grandma did out west , then this might be a good option and having the dog food delivered is a fantastic service . on the other hand , if you have a " special needs " dog , the is probably not the best option . your call .

not what i expected i'm not a big folgers fan , but got this for my folgers loving dad for christmas . i love this one , it dosen't taste cheap , it tastes very good . i'm normally a " milk and sugar with a little bit a coffee " when it comes to drinking folgers but this dosen't need much extras . its also not one of those flavored coffees that you get sick of after 1 cup .

the price is the only thing to like compared to the season brand sardines that are packed in water , these fish are scrawnier , have 4x the sodium , & aren't as densely packed . they cost less than season brand , but even so , i think i'm going back .

return to yester year these little gems remind me of my childhood many years ago when you went to the corner candy store and for a nickle got a fist full of goodies . vanilla tootsie rolls are delightfully delicious but beware ; you won't stop with just one . they are creamy and bursting with flavor . i offered some to my family and they all came back for seconds . anyone who tries these yummies won't be dissapointed .

good value when i bought last summer but no longer i've purchased a couple of cases of 20 ounce cokes in the past year . at that time , amazon was selling them so when they would have a sale , they were a great buy . unfortunately , amazon is no longer carrying them and , as you can see , the shipping cost from the vendor is more than what the cokes cost . as a result , instead of costing less than a dollar each ( great price ! ) , the shipping cost added in makes them cost about $ 2 . 00 each . outrageous ! the only reason i'm giving them 2 stars instead of one is because i love the taste of the product . . . 
=================
impressive service ! aside from the product being as described , and arriving safely and quickly , joel's went of their way to fix my screw up . i mistakenly put the wrong shipping address on my order . when i got the notice alerting me that the shipment would be sent out that day ( nice touch when dealing with delicate contents ) , i just then realized my error . i emailed , explained the situation , and even though they had already labeled my shipment and were headed to the post office , they pulled my order , re - labled the box , and shipped the items later that day . now that may not sound like a big deal , but i seriously doubt many sellers would bother to take the time to fix a customer's mistake for a product that probably doesn't have a large profit margin .

eb pears earth's best makes good baby food that my child likes . however , i am rating their product here as it is available through amazon . i'm very disappointed , like the other reviewer said , about the very short expiration date . a few days before i ordered this , the page said it wasn't in stock and that it would be available sept . 15th . i ordered on the 15th , and it arrived on the 17th as promised with the free 2 - day shipping . my case was supposedly the restocked pears , but the expiration date is nov 09 . new stock shouldn't have an expiration date that is only 2 months away , even if it is on sale ! in the grocery store , the expiration date usually is 1 or 2 years away . 
=================
not as satisfied . . . package was diff when product arrived i got sold on the product when i read the review and hope the only reason for the review was that people all over the world have different taste . the tea arrived in a package which does not match the picture . . . that's not a good start . the side of the package was not sealed and thus i believe the aroma compromised . i wish i had not purchased the tea from china misti actually tried another tea store in ny , ito en . they have an online store too , which you may want to try . i would easily give it five stars or more

has maltodextrin - avoid if you are human i was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in january 2012 . i managed to reduce my a1c from 11 . 7 to 6 . 5 in three months . right after i was diagnosed , i was getting nowhere . i couldn't figure out why my blood sugar would frequently shoot up to over 200 at times even though i was avoiding carbs and sugar . i would feel terrible when my blood sugar jumped like that and my vision would get blurry . it was extremely scary . due to the meds i was taking , i was having some gastric distress so my physician put me on a liquid diet that consisted of sugar free jello , low sodium , msg free chicken broth and water . still my blood sugar would frequently shoot up to almost 200 . i thought it had to be that my blood sugar meter was not working correctly . during this time , i had to have another lab test so when i went to the lab i asked them to test my blood sugar using an actual lab work up and at the same time i would test using my meter . the lab test showed my sugar as 186 and my meter said 183 . the head of the lab said that's very accurate for a home meter . by this time i'd been on that liquid diet for almost 2 days so my blood sugar shouldn't have been fluctuating like it was and if anything , due to the medication i take , it should have been on the low side . i later found out it was from the sugar free jello i was eating . though it says on the nutrition info that it has zero sugar and zero carbs , the reality is that it's full of maltodextrin and because of the way the law reads , food producers don't have to list maltodextrin on the nutrition information , they only have to put it in the list of ingredients . if you look at the label on splenda ( the kind that measures like sugar ) you will see that the first ingredient listed is maltodextrin which is a filler product . it can be made from grain but is generally made from corn and it reacts every bit as strongly on the pancreas as table sugar and white bread . as per my endocrinologist those with diabetes , pre - diabetes and a family history of diabetes should avoid maltodextrin . it's hard on your pancreas and even if you are not prone to diabetes but are dieting , ingesting maltodextrin adversely affects appetite because it reacts so strongly on the pancreas . if you eat something sugar free and notice that you are soon very hungry after , it's from the maltodextrin that's most likely in the product as it's added frequently to sugar free things . my endocrinologist said to avoid sugar and maltodextrin but he said if you can't help yourself and feel you must eat something with either one of those in it then choose the one with table sugar because it's effect will be shorter term and less strong on your body than the maltodextrin . i wish i'd have known this before i was diagnosed with diabetes and maybe i could have avoided it or at least held it off longer . there are chicken flavorings out there that don't include maltodextrin . buy one of those instead .

be aware . . . . this company - fast - pak trading inc . locates in new jersey . we used to buy honey they are distributing here in brooklyn for couple years now . manuka is our favorite , but in past year its price just skyrocketed , so we switched to kamahi and thyme . we love kamahi - it has distinctive taste , not as many american honeys we were trying for years . but ! ! ! last time we bought kamahi from the same fast - pak trading inc . in the local store - it was different honey ! although label says it's the same , but i know the taste and can say for sure - they put something different in the jar . it's more like clover honey , something cheaper and less tasty . so , be aware of it , when you're buying honey from this company . other than that - kamahi is great honey .

waste of time , money and food is there any actual yeast in this ? i have used this many times from several different batches and purchased from different retailers at different times . it often comes prepacked as the yeast in pre - packaged bread mixes . each time i was careful to make sure that it was nowhere near the expiration date . in every case , the bread has failed to rise . this is worse than garbage as it ruins all the ingredients and you have to throw it all out ; there is little worse than needlessly wasting food . when it comes with the pre - packaged mixes , i have tried throwing out this branded " yeast " packet and replaced it with other brands of yeast . when i do this , the bread comes out perfectly . the bread is only ruined if i actually used this brand of yeast . bottom line , if you want to be disappointed and waste time , energy , money and food , then this is exactly what you want . update may 2012 : i have been experimenting with this brand of yeast by trying to activate in the following manner . take one packet ( about two teaspoons ) , add 1 / 4 teaspoon of sugar and 1 / 4 cup of water between 110 and 120 degrees . put it in a coffee cup and get it all nice and wet and wait about five minutes . red star brand and fleischmans ( regular and fast rising ) and the hodgson mill yeast in their bread machine mixes ( the only other ones i have checked ) yeast will rise and fill half the coffee mug . ( fast risers fill the whole cup ) this brands increases its volume by just a little . i have also found that red star ( regular , did not try the fast rise ) yeast that is more than one year past its expiration date performs nearly as well as the fresh stuff . therefore i can say with the confidence of empirical evidence that red star yeast that is more than one year past the expiration on the package performs better ( read : acceptable ) than the packets of unexpired saf yeast i have tried ( read : unacceptable ) .

only good if dog is food motivated i bought this to keep my japanese spitz occupied , no good . i don't know if it's too difficult for her or if she's just not interested in working that hard for food . she's good for a few minutes then gives up even though she'll get food from it .

dangerous product ! ! ! ! ! don't risk your pet's life ! ! i have a 27 - pound scottie and , apparently , his weight was what saved him . interestingly , my dog wouldn't take the treat the second time i offered him one . thank heaven ! ! ! within 24 hours of giving him this product , he started throwing up ( and the " treat " came up almost intact ) because it hadn't digested . i took him into the vet when he started crying and was listless . the vet said if jamie had been a smaller dog , the treat could have killed him . so i'm out $ 127 for my vet and associated medicine . i'm stunned amazon would even handle this product ! ! !

wimpy very cute card came with the seeds , but wow there was like only two seeds smeared on the plastic . i wanted to laugh . i could just go pick a fig around the corner , so thats what i did . i think they should err on the generous side next time and make sure the seeds are visable , and at least the amount you purchase . i will try to plant the two seeds i got , and if they grow will let you all know . maybe it was just a fluke , but gosh .

salt and vinegar chips it was a great value and i like the package size but not vinegary enough for me . won't order this brand again . great chips otherwise .

not very moisturizing i have used a couple of clear brand products in the past and been very pleased with them , but i felt like this conditioner didn't condition well at all . i found myself using more and more every day trying to achieve the conditioning results i got with other brands . my hair is about shoulder length and when i was using about 1 / 3 of a cup daily and still finding my hair to be dry , i decided enough was enough and went back to my old brands .

good , but some stale cookies . . i ordered a dozen of these boxes early may of 2012 . cookies were individually packaged and packed box consistently of 12 , but i still received a number of stale cookies . the " best by " date for all the cookies are july 8 2012 . these leaves me with only two months left . i would expect at least a few more than two months on these . the cookies are tasty , but as good as panda express's . i would buy again , but they really need to send fresher cookies . 5 - 31 - 12 update , ranked down from 4 - > 2 stars . i'm getting a lot more stale and crashed cookies .

urinary problems i feed my puppy this from age 2 months till 9 months and she began having urinary track problems . i spent a lot of money at the vet to figure it out but still have no answers other then switch her on hills . . . what a joke i bought into it and when i opened the bag of hills it smelled so bad . feed her that for 2 weeks ( poor girl ) then i got her on a raw diet that i make myself . everything is great now and she loves it . i recommend looking into a raw diet for your animals . google " raw diets for dogs " you and your pets will be much happier ! ! let's put all dog food companies out of business . . .

sardines for sale i like spicy food and i like sardines , but i don't like these . i simply cannot finish my pack of 10 cans . i like other vigo sardines and i wouldn't say these are low quality , but something about the mixture of these strong flavors doesn't work for me . i can taste them for hours .

not an even variety pack you will get 60 cups of cereal . each cup gives you enough cereal and space to pour a 6 - 8oz of milk . it is very convenient to have the single serving on the go cup . i would of gave a 5 if the quantities were even . 16 - 2 . 1oz frosted flakes10 - 2 . 8oz raisin bran crunch10 - 1 . 5oz apple jacks10 - 1 . 5oz corn pops8 - 2 . 3oz cocoa krispies and6 - 1 . 5 oz froot loops

sugar free ? not quite . the switch kiwi berry , 8 . 3 ounce cans ( pack of 24 ) the switch kiwi berry is a nice beverage alternate to soda , however , it packs a whopping 33 grams of natural sugar in its 8 . 3 oz . single - serving can . i found the taste refreshing and not too sweet , but i am not a regular consumer of carbonated beverages . while this would be a fine alternative to sugar - added , preservative - laden beverages , it contains a high degree of carbs . also , the first and second ingredients are not kiwi or berry juice but apple and grape juice concentrates . if you're watching calories , the 135 in this small can might be better spent on real food . 
=================
overly salty the spice level on these is about equal to claussen's hot & spicy , but at double the sodium content according to the label . i like salty foods , but found these to be overly salty . i think i'd love a " low sodium " version of this , which would be " normal sodium " in anyone else's world . 
=================
not for me tastes too much like licorice . my 10 year old likes it with lots of sugar , nothing like black tea . this is a herbal tea from the mellow bush . i do drink herbal teas , and like them , however this one i dislike . there was no sothing vanilla for me . when the hot water hit the tea the strong scent of licorice came about . i still steeped and added agave and tried it . unfortunately all i could taste was licorice and i had to discard mine . i prefer these red rooibos teas . twinings of london african rooibos red tea ( pack of 20 ) davidson's organic tea south african rooibos , 100 - count tea bags

eucalyptus oil , really ? my cats loved these treats . i loved these because they are cheaper than the cet brand , and neither of my cats had any trouble eating them . why the single star then ? well , because i can no longer give them to my cats in good conscience . they just recently changed the formula to include eucalyptus oil , which is toxic to cats . and it's listed not once , but twice . i have an elderly cat who has chronic renal failure , and there is no way i am giving her anything that is even the tiniest bit toxic . maybe if i had 2 young cats i would be less concerned , but as it stands , there is no way i will buy these treats again unless they change the formula back . i still have the packages from the last order i bought , and there is no eucalyptus oil anywhere in the ingredients . i have no idea what they were thinking when they added a well known toxin to their formula , but i will be buying the cet treats from now on . 
=================
cats went nuts for them after getting over their initial suspicion of the new food treat , my cats wanted more , more , more ! i was even suspicious at first because the treats seemed awfully hard . but once in kitty's mouth , the nibblet moistens a little and the cats just crunch away .

milo's kitchen beef sausage slices with rice while i like the idea of milo's kitchen i found that the ingredients in the product raise some questions about the health risks to my rottie . there are onions and such that could cause harm to my pet so with that said i don't believe i will be purchasing this item again . 
=================
short - lived flavor ( compared to regular orbit gum ) i went through a piece of gum while writing this review - - maybe 5 - 10 minutes ? if you hate gum that gets stale quick , avoid this like the plague . if you're fine literally going through a pack a day ( or a pack every few hours , if you like to constantly chew gum ) , this isn't bad . pros : - great , fresh flavor : i love how intensely minty gum is - - the initial burst of flavor is comparable to an altoids mint . leaves your mouth feeling very clean . flavor is much more intense than regular orbit gum . cons : - short - lived : gum gets stale just as fast as those $ . 25 gumball candies . the wonderful flavor lasts about all of 30 seconds before it begins to dissolve into an unappealing , flavorless mass . you know that feeling when your gum tastes gross because it's so old , but you don't have anywhere to throw it away ? i get that feeling less than 10 minutes in . a regular individually wrapped piece of orbit gum could last me over an hour . - not tooth - whitening : that bit of advertising is a bit misleading . i don't think it doesn't anything to whiten teeth moreso than gum normally would - - just by nature of being sugarless and picking up pieces of plaque . if you were expecting some tasty tooth whitener , look elsewhere . this doesn't affect my opinion of the gum because i never expected it to , but just throwing it out there .

used to be better quality these are inexpensive rawhide bones . they were of decent quality up until the last batch i bought . the centers don't seem to be made with rolled rawhide any longer , but they seem to be a tube filled with rawhide scrap now . will not buy any longer unfortunately . they used to be a great buy .

sweet getaway from syrup - y teas if you want tea that tastes like a melted popsicle , this is not it . if you want something subtle with aroma and combination of flavors , this is the one . this is more than " just peach " tasting . this is peach and savory herbs . soothing . not meant to compete with syrup - y flavors of other teas that are like warm soda or melted candy . this is tea .

absolutely goriffic ! ! around the four minute mark of " evilspeak " , i definitely realized this wasn't the tame television version i remember seeing as a teenager . this is the uncut , unrated and more graphic version with plenty of gore . anchor bay studios have remastered " evilspeak " to it's original 1 . 77 : 1 aspect ratio with crisp and clean dolby 2 . 0 sound . the video transfer is really impressive and worth the money if you're a fan of this movie . after discovering a book of the occult , stanley begins to translate the writings on his computer and he summons a powerful and evil force to help him get his revenge . stanley's fellow classmates and teachers at the military academy have pushed him around for to long and now they'll pay the ultimate price . this movie does have some slow spots , but horror fans will appreciate the gore and carnage left behind as stanley exacts his revenge on his tormentors in gruesome fashion . in my opinion , the ending in " carrie " has nothing on this movie . this movie contains graphic violence , nudity and gore and in my opinion it isn't suitable for children . evilspeak is a bare bones dvd release but does contain commentary with director eric weston and clint howard , plus the original theatrical trailer . clint howard may not be in the same league as his famous brother ron howard as an actor , but he's great when it comes to playing a creepy weirdo . dvd features : * widescreen presentation ( 1 . 77 : 1 ) enhanced for 16 x 9 tvs * audio commentary with writer , producer , director eric weston and star clint howard * theatrical trailer * poster and still gallery

great price and good product . . . the best and most reasonable brownie mix on amazon , plus i've ordered it at least 4 times from this site ( i do a lot of brownie baking during the holidays . . . ! ) and have never been disappointed . . . so i'm giving it 5 stars . . . i make what i call " deep dish " brownies . . . i use a 10 x 15 inch pan instead of the standard 9 x 13 and i double up on the brownie mix . . . two boxes per batch . . . to make a very thick and fudgy brownie that my nieces and nephews love at the holidays . . . if you want to try it , i suggest using 5 eggs for each batch ( instead of the 2 eggs per box x 2 boxes = 4 eggs . . . what the manufacturer recommends ) and lining the pan with reynolds non - stick parchment / foil ( reynolds wrap non - stick pan lining paper - 30 sq . ft , 1 each ) . . . you will love the outcome . . . . . . and a few other hints to please your brownie customers . . . try a batch or two mixed with candy . . . i've done m & m's ( plain and peanut ) , reese's pieces , and even several kinds of whole hershey's kisses mixed in . . . i've used regular kisses , the caramel - filled kisses , and even the coconut creme - filled kisses ( my personal favorite ) . . . forget those brownie mixes that claim they have " chocolate chunks " in them . . . if you want chocolate chunks in your brownies , put 'em in yourself . . !

flour's great - seller not walmart sells this flour for around $ 3 . 66 for five pounds . it's a terrific flour , but the seller is a rip off artist . heck , you can get it cheaper by buying from king arthur flour's website ! 
=================
beware deceptive advertisement ! though the product is first rate cat food , i must say i feel duped by the way the ad was written . the ad shows a six once can and the 24 cans sent were three once cans . going back to the ad i found that at no time do they mention the can weight they just had the big picture of a six once can . so buyer beware for i wont't do business with this seller again .

what flavor is this ? ? i got this ( dark chocolate ) from my mom for easter , and being 22 , im grateful for any present i get at my age . but this candy . . . i dont know . . it just tastes funky . i tried all the flavors and none of them taste like the fruit its supposed to taste like ; cherry and chocolate does have a slight sweet chery taste , but it only lasts for a split second and this is the only one that has a taste even remotly close to the fruit taste . the coconut one also has a fruity - ness to it , but coconut shouldnt be fruity . . . i love jelly belly jelly beans and i love chocolate and the idea of this candy is fantastic , however , they need to taste good . . . . right ? ? ? i figure it had to be common sense but nothing about this is good . . not even the chocolate tastes like chocolate . major fail on this product . 
=================
taco bell sauce the stuff is good , but don't think it's the best . the taste is a little bland compared to other sauces and doesn't really pack any heat to it at all . you would think " hot " meant hot , but this is more like mild to me . try again taco bell . 
=================
half a k - cup ? i at first thought i ordered the wrong product , and had to go back and check . this defeats much of the purpose of a k - cup , having a sealed package with nitrogen gas to keep it fresh until ready to use . when i opened the bag , it was a great smell , as all the aroma escaped into the atmosphere ! know how do you keep the rest fresh ? opening and closing a zip lock isn't going to cut it , as air gets in each time . also , without the cup , i don't think the coffee gets a chance to 'seep' long enough , as it seems a bit weak for something called fog cutter . think i'll avoid this one in the future .

a gluten free ewweee . like other reviewers , i rarely eat cookies because i have an anaphylactic response to wheat / gluten . therefore i generally 'love' any cookies i'm not allergic to . these are an exception . the taste is mild and fleeting . the texture is like sand and leaves a dry feeling in your mouth . the only purpose these cookies are good for is dieting , because they are simply inedible . blah . 
=================
ditto . . . . just ok ordered this product for a candy dish i keep for my fellow employees at work . i like to have a mix of hard candies for them so they can choose for themselves . cherryfield candy sent this product very fast . . . very good response to my order . wrappings are cute , easy to open , nice sized small drop . but the one thing missing is the coffee taste . it's almost tasteless . my problem , i guess , is that i'm comparing it to another more expensive heavily - coffee - flavored larger hard candy . from the good price , i thought these might be smaller items , but with an equally strong coffee taste . i was wrong . i liked cherryfield's service , but do not care for this product ; i will not order these candies again . out of 5 possible stars , i would give this product a 2 1 / 2 .

a bill of goods at a premium price wow , what ups with this water . the ph of the " still " water is 6 and the " sparkling " water is 5 . low in tds , total dissolved minerals , the purer the water the worst it is for your health . pure water with an acidic ph will actually rob the body ( actually your bones ) of valuable minerals in an attempt to neutralize the acidity . and the price for all this . . . let's see . for adequate hydration you should drink 1 / 2 of your body weight in ozs per day ( of healthy restructured ) water . so for a 150 person that's 4 . 43 bottles / day and that would cost you ( 24 pk of voss 16 . 9oz ) , . . . $ 7 . 18 / day , $ 215 / month or $ 2583 . 50 / yr . so this water that's not really any good for your health if you equate it's price per ounce to a gallon of gasoline , you would be paying $ 13 . 35 / gallon for your gas . educate yourselves to what's really going on . . . to find out more visit www . hydration - sense . com

torn up in 5 minutes i was thrilled to buy this for my lab , but within five minutes of letting him play with it he had broken both squeekers , actually torn one out , and after 10 minutes had shredded the poor fox to pieces . don't waste your money . pick up a 25 cent stuffed animal at a yard sale and take the stuffing out of it . it will last just as long .

unfit for scooping tostitos scoops is a misnomer , these chips are unfit for scooping anything more than whipped cream . out of ten attempts to scoop my 7 layer bean dip with these chips , only two were successful . and out of those two success stories one of them ended poorly when the tostitos scoop broke in half and lodged itself in my palate . i am sticking with the frito lay scoops , while traditionally used for chili i think they would do a better job than these sorry pieces .

delicious pumpkin pie mix ! this is delicious , but i wish they would use stevia instead of nutrasweet . i used half water and half milk instead of 4 cups of skim milk and mixed in a blender instead of mixer ( add milk first ) . after 1 to 2 hours in the refrigerator it was set and ready to eat . it works well as a pudding if you don't have ( or don't want ) a crust . after the last review , i was a little concerned that i wouldn't like it . i suppose , if you like your pumpkin pie really sweet , you'll be disappointed . i like the taste of the pumpkin more than a sweet taste so i was very pleased . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ingredients : whey protein concentrate , modified corn starch , pumpkin solids , partially hydrogenated soybean oil , sodium alginate , spices , calcium sulfate , sodium phosphate , aspartame * , natural and artificial flavors . caramel color , fd & c yellow # 6 . contains milk ingredient * phenylketonurics : contains phenylalanine _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

great product . . . . . horrible shipping i have loved this product for years , and when i saw them on sale at amazon , i jumped and placed an order . it si very rare for amazon to mess something up , but they did this time . their shipping method reduced the cookies to shards and crumbs . you could never serve them in that condition . but they make a fantastic crust . lets face it , on this one item , amazon completely dropped the ball on shipping . 
=================

product of chile or mexico ? be aware that nestle usa recently switched supply of nido from their chile plant to mexico and the quality is like night and day . most if not all the previous 5 - star ratings were based on nido from chile were the quality of the milk is far superior than the mexican milk which is horrible !

definite side effects first let me say that i eat a healthy , balanced variety of foods , and am not prone to hardly any bodily disorders . i eat lots of bread and cereal , so this seemed a good choice for supposed good benefits . i noticed after only one bowl , some stomach discomfort and bloating - something i never get save after the massive thanksgiving dinner . it lasted 1 full day , and made me wonder . . . i ate another bowl 2 days later , and sure enough it happened again . after checking online i found a vast amount of space already dedicated to the potent side effects of eating kashi ( noxious gas , bloating , diarrhea . . . ) so , a word to the wise - see if any of these symptoms develop coincidentally with the eating of this cereal . otherwise it has good flavor - but is overly dry and reminds one of chewing styrophoam . . . i guess i'll pass and keep eating my triscuits and raisin bran : )

energy plus mostly minus these energy plus candies are billed as " honey filled caramel drops " . each foil wrapped package contains nine small ( 1 " x 1 / 2 " ) rectangular candies that resemble european - style cough drops . the caramel outside is hard and when bitten into the soft honey filling oozes out . the caramel honey flavor is not bad , not scrumptious , just ok . the reason they are named " energy plus " is that in addition to sugar , corn syrup , milk , honey , butter , and natural flavors , the ingredients also include a middling amount of vitamins b6 , b12 , and c . each 20 calorie candy contains about 35 % of the daily recommended values ( based on a 2000 calorie daily diet ) of b6 , b12 , and c . now let's understand that is is not a food . other than 5g of carbohydrates and 5g of sugar there is no protein , no fiber , no fat , no cholesterol and no salt . this is a candy that has been fortified with three vitamins . one probably derives more of a sense of energy from the carbs and the sugar content rather than the b vitamins . it seems a better choice to have a really satisfying , tasty caramel candy werther's original creamy caramel filled hard candies , 5 . 5 - ounce bags ( pack of 12 ) and take a daily multivitamin centrum performance multivitamin , 60 - count than consume these . on a positive note , these candies are manufactured by ambrosoli in como , italy . if you've never visited beautiful lake como i highly recommend doing so . lake como & its surroundings ( travel adventures ) .

orange you glad ? i agree with the assessment of the original reviewer and i believe that this is a heinous crime against tic tac lovers across the world . the second reviewer is obviously not a true fanatic and will bend to the will of the corporate america . we will not stand for pre - sucked tic tacs , no matter their supposed creed , white is not what they should start out as . this is an outrage , and i , for one , will not stand for it . ps . ) walmart does not carry mega tic tac packs and they suck ( but not pre - suck ) , too .

new formula includes caffeine i bought 2 jugs of the 'new' grape cytomax . i read the ingredients information on the amazon site , but when i went to use the product i now notice that it has a different formula and includes caffeine . some people like that . others do not . regardless , this should be clearly disclosed by amazon . it is not . i can't comment on the taste as with caffeine i have dumped out the product - i don't want that for myself or my family .

updated re : ( good but doubled price since last two orders ) update : 2 days after original review , the price went back down to what it was before . great , because walmart has 3 packs for $ 5 , and i wasn't about to pay the $ 24 that was showing the other day . well , i guess my review is correct - still watch your subscriptions people ! don't get caught when it's $ 24 for a week . : ) i like this mayo because i think hellmann's is the best , and i love olive oil ( plus its good for you ) - not that you can taste it really . i find it to be high quality , and has the hellmann's taste i prefer . i put this on subscription 6 months ago , and have received 2 shipments at $ 11 . 99 each ( for all 3 bottles ) . now , it's more than doubled ! ! ! ! ! be sure to check your subscriptions on things people - when they go up , i don't see a notice or email ( maybe missed it getting so much email these days ) , which i think they should do especially if a price doubles . most of my can - goods did the same thing . one other note , packaging on my first order could have been better . one bottle was dented enough that it opened , and i didn't notice until i finished one bottle - and then found it was rotten . as for the bottles , they have a nice shape , with a wide mouth you can get to if you take off the lid so that you can still get knife / spoon inside if you need or want to . off to check all my subscriptions ! ! !

very tasty spread - would definitely get it again . we ordered two jars of the amish spreads , which arrived today . the seller packs carefully , and the jars arrived quickly and in fine shape . we anxiously opened them both with spoons in hand to enjoy . both spreads were very tasty . the apple blueberry is a definite keeper and i would buy it again without a blink . the cinnamon was a little heavy , but it was still very tasty . the cherry was a little too spicy in my opinion - it seemed again like there wastoo much cinnamon in it , to the point of overriding any cherry flavor . if i was tasting that one blindfolded , i am not sure i could tell it was cherry ! it was still very good , just not as " cherry - ful " as other fruit butters i've had . the spread looked lovely - you could see the cherries , but the taste was obscuredby the spices . note that i love cinnamon in all forms - in cookies , on toast , in spreads , in candy , in gum . so , i am not picking on it - it just seemed to be out of balance . now , i do want to mention one thing that bothered me a little bit . i saw no place or way that these jars were sanitarily sealed . in other words , there was no lid to pop up , no inner seal , no plastic seal on the edges . i am guessing that the jars are filled as orders come in , but it stillbugged me that the screw - on lids didn't seem to have any real seals . i would have liked to at least see those plastic heat - shrink seals aroundthe lids so i could have at least felt i was the first person dipping in the jar ! i did deduct one star for the lack of a visible sanitation process . the jar does say to refrigerate after opening . since there is no seal inside or out , i would refrigerate immediately upon receipt no matter what . so , i would recommend the apple blueberry butter . the cherry butter - well , i am going to keep trying other kinds .

sprouted well , but container too light it did as it was advertised ; in under a week i had a nice little container full of grass . two of my cats loved it , the third was not interested , but that is normal for her . the only complaint i have is that the container is too light . when one of the cats would try to chew off a stem , the container would lift off the ground , making it really hard for them to break the stem off . i ended up having to hold it for them , which means i can't just leave it out for them to nibble as they please . a note for kitten owners : my 5 month old kitten had trouble eating this , i think his teeth aren't spaced quite right yet to be able chew the stems off . i ended up tearing little pieces off and popping them in his mouth , which he was perfectly ok with , the lazy bugger . so if you're buying for kittens , you may want to hold off until they're grown .

birthday gift for my soldier i ordered two boxes of the treats for troopers snack package on april 13 to arrive for my soldier's 20th birthday on may 13 . as of may 15 it hasn't arrived and i'm a little disappointed that his birthday has come and gone without his little " party in a box " . as soon as i receive word that it has arrived i can post a better review . it's what he told me they most enjoy receiving while deployed in iraq for themselves . boxes of little toy animals is what they enjoy getting to give away to the kids . well it's almost christmas and the boxes never did arrive to my soldier . i'm out the money and even though the supplier assured me that they had sent it it never arrived . i asked my son if others were having difficulty in getting their mail and he said they were not . all i can assume is that after two attempts , this item was never actually shipped at all and my money is gone ! great birthday present for my 21 year old soldier , huh ? he is now safe at home , stationed in colorado . that was a great gift for me . i'll be seeing him for christmas . i won't be using this company to send him any more goodies .

good while it lasted . . . but it didn't last ! i started feeding my chocolate lab his dinner in this toy and it worked well . i really enjoyed watching him figure out how to dump this kibble out and he seemed to enjoying the challenge of getting every last piece out . he took to picking up the empty jug and dropping it , as if to ask for more food . . . and after 3 or 4 instances of this , the lid broke . if the lid were better protected from this type of damage i would definitely buy another one . it's not dog proof enough for us .

banana chocolate chip bars that taste like fig newtons if you are a person who is used to eating healthy products , and especially kashi products , you may very much enjoy this snack bar . but if you are looking for a snack bar that tastes like banana and chocolate chips , the name of this variety of snack bar , you may be ( like me ) quite disappointed . i have had kashi cereals and energy bars and the past and have enjoyed them ( some more than others ) , so i was shocked when i opened my first " banana chocolate chip chewy snack bar " to find that it had zero banana flavor and not much chocolate flavor either . there are chips in it that look like they might be chocolate chips , but even when i plucked one out and ate it by itself , i could just barely identify it as tasting chocolate - like ( i . e . , it tasted like carob or some other fake chocolate , even though " semi sweet chocolate " is indeed in the ingredient list ) . . . and certainly , among the sweet taste of a base that tastes like fig newtons , the chips have little chance of standing out . i admire kashi as a company , but i was truly disappointed and angry to have something marketed as banana chocolate chip that tasted like neither . one part of the marketing that is correct is that it is chewy . it has a soft chewy texture and there are some crunchy bits in there that i can't identify . looking at the ingredient list , it could be oats or another of the " kashi seven whole grains . " the description for this product included the words " yummy banana bread taste with dark chocolate chips , just like homemade . " uh . . . not ! i found the sweetness cloying , likely a result of using evaporated cane sugar , fruit purees ( apple and banana ) , and dried pumpkin as sweeteners vs . sugar . the weirdest thing to me is that it tastes so much like fig newtons but has no figs in it ( which makes me now want to read the ingredient list for fig newtons ) . for the record , i love fig newtons . . . but not all the time . . . and not when billed as chocolate . basic nutrition facts per 40g bar : calories 140total fat 3gsat fat 0 . 5g ( no trans fat ) cholesterol 0sodium 125mgtotal carb 25g ( not for you low carbers ! ) fiber 4gsugars 9gprotein 3gincludes small amounts of vitamin a and the minerals iron and calcium . the list of ingredients is about 2 inches long on the side of the box . the box includes 5 1 . 4 ounce bars and claims that these bars provide 1 / 2 serving of fruit and 1 / 2 serving of veggie . i was only able to eat 1 1 / 2 bars in order to write this review . i will be giving the rest of the box to a friend . they don't contain enough protein to be effective as a protein bar and are definitely not satisfying enough to me to be used as a sweet snack . not recommended unless you : 1 . are already accustomed to the cloying sweetness / aftertaste of evaporated cane sugar or are already eating very healthy ; 2 . are looking for a healthy snack bar and don't mind the taste ; 3 . are looking for a snack bar for your kids that is better for them than a candy bar or a high fat snack bar ; or4 . don't mind that the product doesn't taste like bananas or chocolate .

call me crazy , but this is available in the store for 1 . 99 . i love tj's and i'm a frequent shopper , but the price for this reusable shopping tote online is very high . i don't want to discourage anyone from buying and carrying this great , sturdy tote ( i have two ) , but getting it at the store will save you some money !

not bad i've never had a real appletini so i can't say whether or not this tastes like the real thing , but i thought it was pretty good . if i had not read the label and had no idea what flavor it was supposed to be , i don't think i could tell you . it definitely doesn't taste like apple juice or cider . maybe slightly like sour apple hard candies , only it's not sour . it's really pretty sweet . the color of the drink is bright green , so that's kind of fun . i can't say for sure that i'll buy this flavor again , but i will try the other crystal light mocktails . i'm always looking for new low calorie drinks to try .

to me it was just " ok " i could not wait to get this coffee after reading all the raving reviews . it was okay to me . i love costa rican tarrazu , this is just not quite light enough for my taste buds . . . but i've kept it and i do drink it with something sweet and that helps get me past the not so light tasting roast . 
=================
mix is the non - frozen type oasis sells 2 kinds of mix to make frozen drinks . i misunderstood the label on amazon because i thought i was ordering the mix that is always refrigerated . oasis ships these with dry ice to maintain the refrigeration . this item is the version that sits on the shelf until opened . i haven't tasted it yet , but i would have preferred the kind that was likely to have fresher ingredients and less chemicals that must be needed to make this a shelf - stored type of product . oh well . . . . perhaps adding additional rum in the mix will soothe my disappointment .

cost too much now love the product . bought about 2 weeks ago , but the cost has gone up $ 12 . 00 very quickly . am buying from another source .

 " chicory " . . ? i just bought 2 jars of the leroux chicory . . as above . . . years ago i drove thu louisiana and noticed the coffee tasted different . . . chicory . . . so i know what chicory tastes like . this product is not chicory . . . . . it looks and tastes like the pero product . . which i already have . . did not want more of it . . ed . . . . . . . e . . . . bjerk @ cox . neti need to change my opinion . . just bought some ground chicory and it tasted about the same . . very good . . perhaps i am remembering the chicory flavor from many years ago as much stonger than it really is . . i must appologize for my initial opinion . ed

was best trail - mix & healthly breakfast food after morning excerise this was 5 stars but now that amazon has decided not to carry and that the seller on amazon has doubled the price , i am lowering the overall score to 2 stars . i could see a 20 % increase , but 100 % gee . anyway , i now order this from staples . com at $ 25 less than current amazon seller . if price becomes more reasonable . i'd buy thru amazon's seller . but i must now change from 5 stars back to two stars , as this new pricing does not allow the product to get 5 stars from the current seller as priced . the technical and health value of my review below still applies . i enjoy planters trail mix , fruit & nut , 2 - ounce bags along with my bottle of cold water at least 4 early mornings every week . i order this specific trail mix and provide these individual servings to my other workout buddies as well ( great to have friends jog / walk together , insuring no excuses to sleep in ) . other buddies provide the water . we've all naturally lost excess weight over the last 2 years with our made - up program . this trail - mix has been a part of the equation of success with our healthful breakfast and exercise . this product's combo of dried fruit , including papaya , raisins , banana chips , pineapple , cranberries , along with mixed nuts makes this the best tasting and good - for - us trail - mix after our workouts . eating so well , after these pre - sunrise workouts puts me in the right frame of mind for the rest of the day and has helped me stay focused and eat well at lunch and dinner . i sometimes eat one of these as an afternoon snack too . one small warning : under amazon subscribe and save , i do have to often order this version of trail mix at least 20 days in advance before running out of my supply as this trail - mix must be popular to other amazon consumers as well , as this specific product is often backordered on amazon . bottom line , i've tried many trail mixes and this is the brand + mix that is the best combining a great mixture of dried fruit along with mixed nuts .

cost effective . . . . not this is not a deal at all . . . comparing to a pack of three sold at walmart for $ 2 . 65 , a three pack sold here is $ 3 . 11

a great product ruined by misguided marketing i have used this formerly terrifc product for over 10 years . it was the only canned chicken sold in north america that contained no food additives . it was just chicken , water , and sea salt . as of this month ( march 2011 ) new labelling and contents have appeared . the label now proclaims " better flavor " . the product now contains 50 % more sodium - at a time when many manufacturers are either cutting back on salt content or introducing " reduced sodium " vesions of their tradtional products . worse yet , the " better flavor " is achieved by adding " rice starch " , " vegetable starch " ( a call to the company revealed that this is potato starch ) and " chicken broth " - which contains , among other listed ingredients , " natural flavor " ( derived from corn - an increasingly common food allergen ) . this product is now useless to me as i am highly sensitive to corn products . while the label still claims the product is gluten free , which was pretty much guaranteed before , since it had only chicken water and sea salt in it , this claim is now somewhat suspect in as much as with the introduction of each new additive , there is the possiblitly of cross contamination in the prodution of the various grain based starches and " flavors " the company needs to re - think this change . what made them unique and a mainstay for people on specialized diets , was their plain and simple good food . now they are little differnt from every other canned meat that is adulterated with unecessary and unwanted food additives . they can kiss goodbye all their former customers who are allergic to or sensitive to corn , processed starches , who are on the atkins or no grain diets , who have arthritis which is exacerbated by potatoes , and who avoid processed food additives in general . the company also needs to be more up front in their new labelling and say " potato starch " rather than " vegetable starch " and in bold print say " contains corn " to warn customers who are allergic to corn products that they probably should now avoid the product . hopefully this " better flavor " change will be about as successful as new coke " and we will see valley fresh " classic " chicken in a year so .

works fine , but smells bad this stuff seems to protect me as well as the other clinical strength anti - perspirants that i've tried . however , the smell reminds me of an old cosmetic or something that i would find in my grandmother's bathroom . there is no joke intended there , i swear that this is the same scent . my girlfriend agrees , it smells like a grandmother . the smell is not overly strong , so it's not a gigantic problem , just something to consider before buying . i would recommend smelling it at the store before ordering .

not organic . . . i have been consuming seeds for years . i grind flax and sesame seeds in coffee grinder and add cocoa with soy milk for high mineral contents and antioxidants which is a necessity for my healthy diet . organic is the best for me and i am amazed why bob does not carry one since i consume bob's quinoa , flax seed , etc . and all those are organic . i consumed one bag of this then immediately changed to organic years ago . what is so disturbing is that not only bob will not produce the organic but his followers / ( possibly associates ) will rate anyone who says anything true but not favourable negative . talking about politics . wow . . . i will consume organic regardless of story line that bob gives on the phone .

wrong bag pictured just an fyi to other customers : this item is for the beef and ocean fish formula which is in a red bag . in my haste , i purchased this thinking it was a the 15lb version of the chicken and rice formula . woops ! so i went and bought the 15lb bag of chicken and rice and mix the beef and fish in so it didn't wreak havoc on my pup's digestive system . i can say that after we started feeding this to my pup , she starting having stinky farts and had never had them before . also , roshan's right about the fish breath ! ick . overall , my dog has no issues with this formula , it's just stinky so i'll stick to chicken and rice after this bag is done .

i actually love this product - but what a mistake i made - size ! ! ! i truly love bassett's jbs ! ! ! ! if you buy them , and you love sweet jelly candy - you'll love these guys ! however , i bought the item thinking the package was the bag about 3 times this size - mistake . this package is 215g which weighs 1 / 2 pound . $ 20 for a pound of these is a complete rip ! ! ! ! this item actually sells for about $ 3 in stores where you can find this english treat . be careful - unlike me .

the cost is to high i found these at the dollar story , for you just it $ 1 . please ! the only good thing about this purchase was the container . do the math .

go with the tv cooks on this one i still have one of these sitting around from way back when whole nutmeg was only known in culinary schools . nutmeg is particularly notorious for losing its flavor quickly when ground , so all cooks who use nutmeg regularly know that you have to use the nutmeg minutes after you grind / grate it . from this standpoint , it is better than the ground nutmeg every big - brand spice vendor under the sun sells - - which is to say , it's better than sawdust . the moment i decided never to use plastic spice grinders again was when i made some pumpkin pie with this stuff , because one of the first things i noticed was that i could feel the bits of nutmeg in the final product , kind of like tiny corn cob bits . i also noticed that while the nutmeg flavor wasn't completely gone , it wasn't as strong as it was when we first bought it , because this is filled with chunks of nutmeg rather than whole nuts - - that increases the surface area and the rate of loss of volatile flavor compounds . this stuff works okay in things like oatmeal cookies , where you're not going to notice the texture of the rather coarsely ground nutmeg . but for anything else , you're best off doing what the tv cooks do , and getting whole nutmeg and a grater like this microplane stainless steel zester and just grating a little off into the dish you're making . the flavor will be stronger , there won't be any grit from the nutmeg , and you will have a nice tool for other tasty things like citrus zest and parmesan cheese . plus , you can easily find whole nutmeg now online or in some brick - and - mortar markets .

great drink , awful price i love this drink , but be warned , the price here ( $ 53 ) is nearly double that of a regular grocery store in the us ( $ 30 ) . sometimes they're on sale for even less .

old things may be better ? to avoid all the chemicals and sugar in all the newer sweeteners like splenda . . . i was advised to go back to saccharin . . . . it's very very sweet . . . a half tablet , and they are small , is enough for one cup of tea .

must have for my dogs i love the c . e . t . chews for my dogs ! i have chihuahuas and shih tzus . both breeds have mouth shapes that are a challenge to find a chew that they will / can use . the c . e . t . chews are not uniform in size and thickness but because of the different mouths here that is a plus . for the very aggressive chewers here i give the thickest of all to . for the guys with the smaller mouths that don't chew very much i use the thinnest chews . i have read many reviews about how to cut these chews to smaller sizes to fit the dog . one was to soak the chew in water to soften it but it would remove some of the good qualities of the chews and i didn't like that . i tried to cut them by holding them with pliers and using a hacksaw . well that was nuts and just didn't work . finally i decided to try a pair of new tree branch loping shears to cut the chews and found success at last . this way i don't have to have so many bags of different sizes . i do have a very spoiled chihuahua here that will not use any of the chew toys i provide . his month is very tiny which would make cleaning with a tooth scaler hard plus he gets upset if he has to stay at the vet . these chews are the only thing he will chew at all to get tarter off his teeth .

shipping makes these much more expensive than grocery store great crackers . but for those who say these are cheaper than at their store they probably weren't including shipping . shipping to me made these $ 4 . 40 for each package . our local and very expensive grocery store sells them for $ 4 .

look elsewhere . . . i'm a fan of most energy drinks , but no fear's super energy is not impressive . each can contains two servings , each serving being 130 calories and 33 grams of sugar , and only 90 milligrams of caffeine . for me that is a lot of empty calories and not a whole lot of " energy " to be honest with you . taste wise it's actually quite pleasant . drink it super chilled or iced and it's refreshing . energy wise , it's not even close to my standard celsius or guru that i drink . if you're not too concerned about calories and want something a bit different than coffee in the morning , give it a shot . if you're wanting some energy and not a bunch of sugar , i'd recommend taking a look at the two products mentioned above .

nothing broken i was little hesitant ordering this since people were talking about receiving smashed bottles , but i couldn't pass up the deal . i received mine in speedy time and the bottles were all individually bubble wrapped and inside a plastic thing and then inside the box . nothing was broken at all and the extract is amazing !
